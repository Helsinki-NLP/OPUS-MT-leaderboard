Peter Chech: Along the last time?
Possible It's All
This day is the last day when you can still go through the transfer window and make a big transition.
There's another chance to come in the dark.
Peter Čech, the currently replaced prisoner Chelsea, but now he is not sitting on the new professional agreement in Madrid, Monaku and Paris.
Sitting in the Smich NH Hotel, talking to the Chess newspapers, and with a chess representative on the front-general of the United States, and then at the beginning of the Euro 2016 qualifications against the Netherlands.
In the gate Chelsea, in the new section Premier League, Thibaut Courtois, Chech was first ten years in the London Club getting to the location of the restaurant.
Any time, it was speculated that the Checha could be interested in Real Madrid.
In the session, he lost Spanish Superpower in the Soboths with Atletics, and did not control the entrance of the line session when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
It was also looking for Paris SG interest.
This in France's session was two expenditures and two restrictions, in the week-of-day St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively, AS Monaco's boot club.
He's still in the list 1-1-2, and on week he's divorced with Lille at least 1:1.
On the Bulgarian English Webs today, the reports have reported that Checha could want to be in Queens Park Rangers.
According to the English bookmakers, but the Chech's department from Chelsea for the last time is not too probable.
Skybet wrote to him the curses 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that you still change the door for some hours in the rest?
I don't calculate it, but in the photoball, it's never a gradient.
It's likely for the day, a gift that doesn't reject.
How should it look like that?
"Now I don't know how such a offer that can't deny it, it looks like.
It would have to go to the convention of all the parties Forefront would be concerned with Chelsea's position if he had made an accidental offer or not.
Is it technically realisable to make such a transition when you're in Prace now?
Doesn't you need to sign somewhere in a case of a new contract?
I didn't think so.
But in such situations, there are many players today, they are all at representative constraints and, of course, there will be a lot of procedures to be closed today.
So it'd be something real that would be.
How many clubs are on the planet that could allow you?
Well, I don't really know.
So you're not going to go?
The situation, when I hadn't missed in the first three new sessions, I've been a new carrier for me for 15 years.
However, there is no reason to panic, to be afraid and to leave somewhere.
I want this room on the position of Chelsea's branch, and it's on the trainer who chooses what decisions he will do for the next weeks.
What role in your decision is the family playing?
I'll take all the factors in mind.
The basic is an understanding of sports, but I look at it also from the personal pages where the family needs are, of course.
Is it possible that you'd like to take another club in England?
That's the question I thought I would never be concerned with me.
But in the photoball, it's all possible.
I don't want to say anything.
I don't know the answer.

Recommendation of the very American ideal that job laws are equally human rights
The Congress Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law that has the organization to protect as a civil law.
“Before the departments work, the workplaces are working for the Central Class,” says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is a partner of the Congress Committee.
That is why I'm so hungry that I can simultaneously represent the law of the employees.
This average legislation provides the workers the same legal options as to protect discrimination in the organization of debates, such as in other forms of discrimination - and stops against defense forces
Adjust the law of work relations so that it allows all employees who are discriminatory if they want to enter the deputy, to judge in the civil court - and to judge the disagreement or replacement of disagreement - is a right and necessary initiative.
Of course, but it's not a radically initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other proposals in the law, is to review the American ideal.
Even through the campaign wars in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States - the Americans sometimes supported the country throughout the world to accept, expand and respect work laws.
They were time, and millions of Americans are still remembering when the country has made a decade of democracy, the freedom of words, the freedom of pressure and the right to collect.
When the United States were in Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his counselors supported the land to adopt the establishment to ensure that the military autocrat Hyde Toja will be replaced by the democracy.
They were convinced that the employees and their officers play a role in the forming of new Japan, entering their language and openly recognised that “the right of employees to collect themselves, collectively assemble and act.”
When the United States had located Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advice chose German to create a schedule that ensures that the fashismus Adolfa Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and prosecute in the new country, and thus claimed that openly says: “It is right to create communities that will ensure and better work and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and every call or professional.
The units which will be limited or encouraging the right to be restricted, will be rejected, and the measures to fulfill such purpose are unlawful.
When the first Lady Eleanor Roosevelt President of the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, the representatives and the Roosevelt guarantee that “all rights are in the framework of the protection of its interests and entering into them”.
All American generations accepted the basic premium that the work rights are human rights.
When the country was radiated to other countries, how to create a citizen and democratic company, the Americans explained that the right to create workshops - and their participation in collective department with companies and government agents in the position of equal partners - must be protected.
Now, when these laws are affected in America, it is necessary to return to the American ideal that workers must have the right to organize and organize free and open society.
Just as 50 years ago Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.
The story is a big teacher.
Everyone knows that the nation's forces have not decreased, but they have expanded it.
The live standards of millions of people have increased, have created the market for industrial and production, have made it an increasing level.
These simple truths are forgotten, but the story remembers them.
The story doesn't forget, and we wouldn't have.
Formal recognition of work rights such as humans - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights to protect discrimination in the organization of debates - has a great extent.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have invited America and have made the real promise of democracy.
The judge was temporarily blocking the law that could close all the patent clinicals in Louisiana
The Federal Court of Justice was temporarily blocked the Russian law, which would likely close all five clinics in the country.
In June 1, September 1, the administration of the Romanian Government of Bobby Jindal shall be required to take the right to the patient in the hospital remote to 30 miles from the execution of their practice.
The explanation of the judge means that doctors can temporarily continue in the execution of legal penalties and should be allowed to take care of this.
“The proposing side will be legally able to exercise its activities and to receive authorisation,” states John deGravelles.
The hearing shall be planned during a month, so that the judge may provide a longer delay in respect of the law.
Activitys for the right to prevent the last in the series of similar measures, have found and said that doctors will provide more time to get authorised.
“The present decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe before the legal law to prepare for health and their rights,” announced Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Centre for Production Law, which, in the name of three of the Fifth Clinic Clinic, has been locked on the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was concerned with doctors with two clinicals that were not among the requests and also requested the authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven States that adopted similar laws, including the Courts in Alabama and Mississippi, which were stated by such measures.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the resident clinics in the State, blocked the federal judge in the fifth.
Guerrers for women's rights to steal together with the United States Birthdays and Genochologists and the American Medical Association say that the need to have this authorisation costs for medical requirements that are not necessary from the medical view.
The resistance of the courts rejected the measures to protect women’s health, and some also found the fact that the clinics would be closed by measures.
The manufacturer centre showed that in Louisiana only one doctor carried out.
If all doctors in the country were taken to stop carried out, this doctor would also have stopped to carry out their safety, she said the group.
The Louisian Offices in the reaction have said that the doctors who carried out are not reserved while waiting for the establishment of the requirements of law.
For the late diagnosis and bad accessibility of the treatment are killed at the outside raccoon of vaccins
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with their born mother who died on the shipping of vacation in 2007.
For a woman on the Australian outside, they're dead in the rake of vaccins than in their cities.
The researchers analysed the medical records more than 1100 Australian diagnosised in 2005 with rack vaccins and found that 35% was alive only five years after diagnosis.
The investigation of Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute showed that women in foreign and distant areas of State were about twenty percent higher probability that during the study they died than women in cities.
MALÁ STUDIE: New medicines can discharge fish and vaccins
The investigators of women were looking for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the opportunity to survive has affected adult women during the diagnosis, the type of carcino vaccins, another existing disease and social economic status.
The latter way of survival was made in the elders of the women who were diagnosed in the further stage.
Women in foreign and farmers of the State had almost twenty percent of the probability that during the study they died than women in the cities.
Although the study was not proposed to determine why women who lived beyond the city were higher probability that they died on the rack of vaccins, Dr. Jordan says that factors may be late diagnosis and bad accessibility of treatment.
“ The disease can be the best to treat genoonologists who usually sit in the largest cities, ” said she.
Moreover, through the improvement of medicine services for a delay that have to convince the barrier in a remote way, the doctor suggested that it would help the transport services that specialists can treat women near their homes, and the support programmes of people who treat away from their families and friends.
Dr. Jordan declared that the study described that the long-term survival of women with rabbit vaccins is a lower place, which enhances the need of better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research financed Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today Public Medical Journal of Australia.
In March, in 33 years, Elisha Neave's mother was diagnosed in the city of Gold Coast with a aggressive form of vaccins.
The garden centre reduces the number of home owners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, a pool linked to the extraordinary residence of the households of younger 35 years could be taken into account that a young generation of consumers will bring “the main age group of gardens, ” the garden center will come to 10 million libras each year.
According to the reports they will lose for their gardens of people who live in their lives, in average of 55% of the parts of which people will lose lives in their own.
As other factors that are increasing sectors, which makes five billion books a year, indicates the increase of the number of people living in very urbanized areas where they are not gardens, the extent of the prevention used as a parking board and reducing the size of the garden.
In the field of the Grand London, where he shared own houses in six years from 61% to 43%, they appear to one house's lower costs for garden products in the United Kingdom.
The HTA and the King's Garden Company said that the residence in the undertaking or the absence of space does not mean that people could not increase plants.
Guy Barter, the main garden adviser for RHS, said: “The rewards are very favorable to grow growth in the floors - when they move, they can take rosters with themselves."
The HTA report rejected that the “grot age” of the garden smaller sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of the higher part of the owners of households and economic prosperity remaining from 80 to half of 90 years.
In this year, he also proposed to be a lot of greater thanks to the better time, which came after injury conditions in March and April.
When the East Dictor speaks about democracy.
After Putin saved his younger organization, who was most reminding me of Hitlerjugend, he saved the atom armes and, in particular, showed that their opinions were broken to him, he made us a proposal on democracy today.
But I feel like that the current mode in Russia shows a lot of fascist states.
Great nations have a joint and it is that they can control as a nationalism, as well as that complexity of minority can transform into imperialist challenges.
The time is on the east seems different than on the west.
While the West World thought that the war on the European overseer was a long time ago , on the east he believed that they were looking for a long time and they needed to reach their international position.
Such anxiety and frustration ruled in Germany in thirty years, instead of understanding the power of the natives and then followed the exploitation of the nationalism inlike situation in Russia.
And then the entire cult of the strong leader, the young newspapers, the liquidation of the inadequate political responsibilities, the discrimination of minors and homosexuals, is therefore a lot of similar.
Vladimir Putino and, of course, the largest parts of the Russians may have been steadfast after the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part fell before them.
Maybe this western policies have committed themselves, maybe a little Vladimir smoothed after the border, maybe they didn't call him where he was used and may have started to appreciate him, and he was just keeping himself like a typical Russian man.
He made his orders home, he thought he really didn't want anywhere and broke his feet home.
Now he decided that he's gonna return the lost position.
Let's start soon. It's time.
The leader's likely to be alive, so where he'd be quick.
He sent Kavkazany, now sends Ukraine, then they're on a number of travelers from Pobalt.
I'll have the Russian room for a long time in the kitchen.
This will certainly be sure that China's a lot of exceeding, and it's sure that it's a close east.
And the Germans, the Vladimir, too, like they're good, and I gave them that in 45.
What's this to do in a new Novorosia in Karl Varech.
It would be a baseball, and ours are a lot there, and how they shoot them there, and they wanted to build a leckter from them.
Our veteranists remember how they had in the Slovakia.
Now the vote is that their Premier Economic Sobotka, who is so smile, will be lying as cibling and dreaming the entire EU.
That would be so much that they'd spread up on the Great Russians.
We need to remind them where they are.
And we use our partners who live in their territory.
The Russians are all over, and when they say they're kissed there, they're just smoking there and we don't leave it, we're protecting them.
And Russ will rule again, because it's born to what others.
However, Europe is just good as a presentation on which Ivan's hungry can dance a cocktail.

According to the very monitored statistics of the lives prices in the latter period increased most for the last seven years.
According to the index of the bytes in Australian main town of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased in August 1,1 % of the age price, it was carried out in the Sunday of the Agency.
The increase has been carried out to the total growth of June, Red and Silver at 4,2 %, the highest increase for the remote month since 2007.
The annual growth of price increased at 10,9 %, more than a double level for one year to August 2013, however, the growth was not equally distributed in the country.

RP Data numbers show that the prices in Sydney in the last year have increased 16,1 %, while the prices in Melbourne are 11,7 %.
In addition, the most strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with a increased price in average between five and six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra was able to cut down the state of the cost reduction and where the prices were increased only to 1,4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when the year begins, it increases the number of possibilities to sell, which will be for the market 'the real trial'.
“Because the extent of the higher rate of achievements, generally the high speed of selling and lower rate, it is likely that the value of residence in the next three months is still increased,” said.
Lenny Henry, my father never found me.
He never told me, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven Jamaica children in Dudley in Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry 19 was, and he worked in the company, had a worst relationship.
Henry tests the company, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on immature conversation with his father and which is part of the series of Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a rational reggae and rapu and melodie is optimistic.
Henry had to advise a few unfair reminders of the child.

He knew it was a little worse about him.
You have never seen his face, but you only heard his voice: “Stop with this branch.
Let her sister be at the room.
Huh!
I want to look at the cricket.
My elders, Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, were already adults - with him went to the bar and spent things like the face of birds, or the beautiful box in the cricket.
I never spoke so with him.
Most of my life, it was a serious guy in the kitchen that reads news.
Henry recently visited a dream in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than his father's time, he saw what he had to live for him.
Today there's something more light, but it's still dark, smoothed, smooth labyrint, where the flowers explode, and there's a lot of smoke and smoke.
Dad always entered into the van, and he just slept there, then he was listening to how long she's beginning to sing for himself, because she's smile from herself.
When I went around, I realized that I did this years to use the family, and I began to worry about him more.
And yet, Henry's childhood without parents' love.
Dad didn't find anybody, he said, "I love you."
When mom was sick and died, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billy, who's with Dawn French, allowed him to live a love that was wrong with him as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Don't take me anymore!
Dad, I'm 22!
S Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It's a beautiful mom.
With France who was married 25 years are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why should we not be friends with Dawn?
It's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had a sugar.
It was one of the things she killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of surprise and started showing the signs of the sugar, the doctor told me, "You have to make a radically change."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to keep a drastical diet to get out of signs.
It's very hard.
It's my name.
Nobody wants to eat the same meat.
The changes in the direction of Henry's carriers may be turned into his elegant, at least watched brothers.
After he got recognition of the crisis for his Othella, he went into a divade.

It's another experience than sittings and comedias that fulfilled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in the office.
DJ looked at him on the afternoon as he was born, and wrote about him in a talentful New Faces.
His TV career began in half of 70 years: “I was the only black imitator/comic in the TV.”
He's learning for the future.
In addition to the fact that I had to take a publicity, I also had to learn how to think of functioning dreams, to be stars and to spend in the TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
While his manager has owned the right to the southern production The Black and White Minstrel Show, a funeral program in which the heritage had reviewed the black, Henry was in her with his comediate at the end of five years.
My family's been pregnant because of that.
I'm sure it's never happening, but I can't do it.
Although it was a special and extraordinary position, I worked on large scenes and learned how to work with the damage.
What was "years and years assessed the main product of the British TV," but it was also "great parodies of black."
In 80 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative commercial crowds and presented states that were also amazed and glorified the British black culture.
The first series The Lenny Henry Show started sending in 1984 and in the 90s was not known as Shepherd Gareth Blacklock in the Communication Serial Chef!.
The next decades took him reclaims, documents, TV series and role in films, but after reviewing his series LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said, "So what you're going to do now, Lene, it seems that you've been in a place, or you're a little walking out of the way."
The next line was a documentary order on the radio 4 called What's So Great About.../What's so great on...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergic on Shakespear.
We didn't get him right in school, and I thought it was something for the white central class.
So I was afraid of that.
All we've been talking about, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try."
Don't worry about that if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespear.
Henry for the document brought twenty lines from Othello's final word and already went in.
It's got me feeling I can do it.
It's like if it's got a rebellion to me.
“ It's a serious thing, it's seriously, learn a text, find something about it.
So the trial was hard and before I read the game a month and a month.
And it was successful.
It seemed that they waited for a spectacle that wasn't happening.
He just started playing in Comedia full of losses.
I was the only one in the National Division, I couldn't believe it.
I thought, "You changed."
It came to the technical difficulty, and Henry felt instinctly that he had to overcome the responsibility for the public.
"The news in my head said, 'Before the computer driver, you have to buy them 10 minutes."
Instead of this Divadel regime, the presentation will continue when the problem is resolved.
I went out of the ship, and something in me said, "Hmm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Somebody can solve it for me.
"You play, stay in the role."
Henry v Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of Plot was called.
Panika is very good, he adds a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like God’s signs that says, "You should do this."
Of course, it's the one who says a vote.
So I'm staying there.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the experiment.
However, Henry remains the brain of comediant - all time our conversation can interrupt humor expressions when he enters and goes out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make a stand-up, because there's a little dangerous relationship from the room of the full of strangers, I'd say.
When you're still looking for something, you can get to the blind street.
Sometimes, if I want, I'm doing Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as before.
I asked if he's still organized some turn-up status.
I'm glad to sit in one room with a governor who helps give the rooms of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'd like to give it sometimes.
So your new incarcery?
I think so.
Herects are talking about me.
It's funny.
You're still telling the story that's great.
I love story.
People love story.
Kenia registers the State Officers to achieve its existing employment
Kenya started with biometric recording all its State officers to try to remove from the payment list of governments that are not employed.
According to the declaration of governments, employees who are not registered in the next two weeks shall receive the payment.
The Government believes that thousands of people have received money and after they have left the State service.
After the Office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised that the corruption would be restricted in the State treatment.
Audit conducted in this year showed that the State comes in a month at least one million dollars (7000,000 libers) for the payments of non-existent employees and the next officer's use.
The Government is sure that the payments are still attached to the bank accounts and after the death of the employment or after the employer of the State Management, introduced BBC reporter from the main city of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All State officers must be set into the identification centres where their data will be biometrically indicated shall be applied in the statement of the government.
Continue says that everyone who doesn't have enough forgiveness will be issued from the payment list.
“The training of real employees of the public services of this measure will also be used to clean up the payment lists on both levels and to resolve such a problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waigur, the Secretary of Development and Planning Ministry.
Decades of Turkish policy arrested by the "rebellion" against the government
The local media claims that in Turkey was arrested because of the “rebellion against Government” total 33 police policies.
The police office has not yet commented.
According to Hurity Dail News, there were fourteen high officers.
Some of them were included in a prosinc investigation of corruption, which had been addressed to government officers, including four ministers.
In June, several tourists were arrested for the detailed organization of criminal gang and telephone audience.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (in that time the President of the Government) marked their action as part of the participation of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülena against him and other people in the power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine were opened again on Monday (1 September) after airspaces.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the President of the Government of Arseny Jaceňuk brought his daughter to school.
In this opportunity he shared the newspapers that not all schools have been opened again, but that the country is decided to protect for the following generation:
Not on all schools, the traditional ceremony was fulfilled to September 1.
Not all Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
All Ukraine, connected Ukraine's front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher in Slovakia, visiting Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russia.
We hope that there will endure peace and that children get knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated so that the children are clothed up, bringing ballons and teachers flowers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe BBC found a boss for difficult times
He takes a cloud of glory from the world of bankovership, media management and internal concerts of concerts.
He's the same experience from the previous line.
Kariéru started in Bain and Co consultant company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Mediterranean world of Pearsons.
Seven years was a executive director of Financial Times, and it was replaced when the highest function in the Material Company Pearson's contained her youngest colleague.
She says that her distance has been near a million books.
Her political portfolio is also weird.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, ancient director of BP, when Cameron had needed a private expert in Whitehallu: the advice of the Government.
Her husband is the old member of the city's advice.
In May, I described the manager's work as a cup with the eating.
Not only that the BBC is distributed and spreaded entity in the public life center, but in its structure there is also an internal paradox.
Corporation is turned to two directions: inside the top level of the BBC ownerarchie, but also out of public voice in time of silence when things are not functioning.
It is about at least unmantainable monopol, which requests a valid reform.
But the director would risk that he would come to the company as a Chinese dynastie, spend it, and he will prepare himself for work.
It's a hard call.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would like to see how the BBC is reduced - her power, her finance - and how it is looking for her status.
With the extension of the competition and the new technologies, an ancient security, the intermediate action on the consensus proposals for the BBC is increasingly dangerous.
The British publication sells annually a part in something that is probably the biggest medical business in the world.
The BBC reports a good story: it says that her production is 96% of households, and each of them is only 40 pens day.
Furthermore, the BBC is clearly submitted: 53 % of the contributors to 31 % before ten years.
BBC use models have changed: new titles today are shown on the mobile phone and on the orders I have passed, I can see iPlayer.
But the BBC still remains very loving and wonderful institutions.
He needs a wonderful director, I hope she found one.
The Texas Governor Perry says that an urgent twin didn't bear
Tweet from the Official Twitter Account of the Texas Governor Rick Perry, published in the week, contained an urgent image of the Democratic State Prosecution, which initialized Perry's criminal offence from the use of power.
Tweet was deleted later, and on Perry's account was published another one from the previous.
I'm not allowed to get out of my account, but I'm not allowed.
“I'm not agreed with the second, and I've got him up," he said to another point.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to the reports with questions immediately.
Although the two were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his management.
The previous tweet published an immoral, humor image of the State Procurement of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, which was judged in April 2013.
When she refused to reject, Perry refused to pay payments for her office, which was Perry, the potential candidate to the President in 2016 elections, this month was brought before a great port in Austin.
On the title of the tact, "I'm not always lead to three times higher hot alcohol in blood than it is allowed to be able to... but if yes, I ask the Governor Perry that he calls me for responsibility."
I'm the worst democracy in Texas.
Research against Perry didn't bring Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, a special procureur of San Antonia, who was determined by the Republic Court.
Perry was looking for an innocent and accusation called a taktic, political manage.
His qualitative legal team requested the judge to observe the case to reject accusation, because the use of laws for the court's exchange of the most part of the service gubernament in the Texas history is contrast.
Perry interrupted $7,5 million from the State Fund for distribution of public interests in Travis County and steal of corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to reject.
The refusation was called formal stress to the Lewis orientated groups of citizen activities.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's proud.
After Iowa, during his president campaign in 2012, he ended on the fifth place in his Committee on his side, Perry answered the speculation of that he could have finished, twice with his own photo, as he walks near the ship, and said, "Then I am, South Karolin!"

An extraordinary excuse from the anointed new Rome of Howarda Jacobson on love and letter "J"
They solved, it's the best way to write it, and they've made it easily as a carton box that someone left on the rain.
Just since time, a woman said to him that she was too serious, complicated, smoking, isolated and might be a little poor.
And then she got his hands.
He allowed it.
He could sing like a egg, yeah.
The last sacrifice of this ability was the beginning of a merciful flock, which usually promised him to be able to be able to give him some happiness.
Ailinn Solomons was a green beauty with a divine blood hair and a flying heart from the ice at the northern island, which was still far away and inherited than Port Reuben.
It came to the south of the old community that Kevern thought that it was her teena that had raised the mate in the woods, but the beautiful field called, appropriate, the Raj field.
There's no one in the house for a few years.
Trubs were proceeded, in the vagues were dead pawns, the slippers were signed on the window, as if they thought that it was their place, the garden was grown and the plot reminded the great green heads.
The house looked like a chaloupe of children's story, worried, and even awful, to celebrate full secret.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose room "J" is on the previous list of names on Man Booker Price 2014.
The new choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the crowds in a long train and hold on their hands, they used unexpectedly the full-term lunch, unexpectedly to follow the public state that the country had occupied with a quiet music and quiet reports when he had mentioned the old letter of a long-term black comication that had been able to keep his officer.
You have a lot of big feet.
Because of their natural agressive songs, they haven't played such songs in the radios.
They were not deleted - actually none - they just did not play.
They helped them to get into the desuate, even as the same word of deceit.
People's instruction proved that they would never have made laws and statutes besides the law, and as people who include the book, they choose memories in which the poor states of riches, cookers and loving rooms, so in music they choose balances.
Kavern left to shoot the day and started playing on the immature lunch and a grievous, comicful voice, singing the Serena of Ailline's big passengers.
I've got it.
“ This was a favorite song from Fatse Walller's jazz planist, ” said and automatically added two pieces to the bones.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to get a letter of j before he's out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was still small.
Dad told him that the game was playing with his father.
When you were in the words that started in J, they didn't have two sticks before the bottom, you've got the pence.
This time it wasn't so funny and funny, it wasn't even now.
He just knew that he was waiting for him, it was all.
He had to explain what's jazz.
Ailinn never heard.
No jazz, even though it wasn't just established outside the law, they didn't play.
The improvisor has gone out of the way.
In life, there was only a place for one “see. ”
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know where exactly it ends.
That's the same humor.
His inheritance went to people to nerve.
And Jazz was a humor out of the song.
Although he wasn't heard about Sammy Davis Junior until ten years, Kevern jazz was known from the father's half of the old CD collection.
At least, but Iillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
In view of his age, she couldn't remember the time when the favorite songs were not black.
It's also without laws or tickets.
The free company is in which each part of her gratitude - thanks to those who were happy insurance - agrees with the principles of the group of thanksgiving.
People of the African Caribbean origin with temperature and constitution were cutting for bathrooms and athletics, so they sing and run.
People of the origin of the Indian subcontinent, like the nature of electricity, have taken responsibility for that no family will be without a functional phone.
The pockets left were installers, the Greeks, which remained, miscreases.
Those of the Pharisees and Levant States, whose birthmans did not quickly left the land, while it was done, CO SE STALO, KDYBY THE STALO - feared that they would accuse them to be attached to the fire, actually fearing that the next fire was - opened the restaurant where he sold the labs and buying water, not observed themselves, and the infection was so scared.
Everyone according to his talent.
As she just heard the balady, Ailinn was hard to understand how to sing to her simple words that Cavern had just been singing, she could get out of music.
The music was the expression of love.
“In fact, they are not growing, ” said Kevern.
Maybe only for people who have a lot of big feet.
My father never hit anybody, but this song liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the unfortunate garden added the illness of security.
Without audio letters, no word could be declined.
Ailinn hasn't yet understanded.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say that it was funny, but he was able to put up in her attempts again two foots to the mouths.
She's already thinking she's weird.
"It seems to be funny," said he finally.
She's incrediblely smoked his head and shocked Kevern's view.
In the whole wide world, there was nothing other than the mixture of her hairs.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said.
But it doesn't explain why you can sing her.
She seems really developed.
Do I have a lot of big feet?
He looked back.
She's just not going.
Maybe a little kitchen...
You're saying you don't know me because I've got a lot of damn cats?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could tell her “I love you ” but it was too soon.
"Your thick caters just approximate me," he tried.
I'm so funny.
That's not possible.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in difficulty, because, as his father, he ran the cup of the need to make the cross that he had in the skins.
Maybe his father was a cruel meaning.
Maybe it was a cruel Cavern.
Besides a good eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's skin and took her out of the bed, broke the radio and divorced the unopportable wine.
I don't have a wine, so I couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to be in her disappointment as a palm list in the wall.
She said, "I'm guessing that you're stupid."
When it doesn't apply me.
She was apologized for his unbelieving words, so because of the fear that she had in her eyes at the moment she stood against him.
Did she think she's going to get her?
She didn't talk to him about life on a cold north field where she grows, but he didn't realize that it was the same thing in the bases.
He had the same wide and wood ocean about them.
The same memories of men, then, CO SE STALO, even more increasing and more lower than their foreheads, guards and census, have been blown down from the economy to the household, preparing to put up the hand on any woman who would refuse them to refuse or be disappointed to them.
Blbec?
If you don't have a attention, they'll bring her up!
First of the anointing - anointing became the most common expression for the erotic treatment between a man and a woman: the contrary of the smile balds of the love that the radio broke - they anointed her first, then kill her one.
According to the Known's opinion, it was very cultural, because the misfortune was the same act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons has noticed him to leave.
He's getting out of the bed as an old man.
She felt dead, but his pain was surprising her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They're almost unknown.
She was looking at how she goes - as if she had watched him from the window in the parent - a man who did what he did.
Adam left the garden, thought.
The heart was threatened by her, and because of all men, usually, unlike that a couple of them had killed her.
The man turned back from her, a holy, horrible, shameful, all the battle left him, why seemed that this look was well known, even though she couldn't save the only moment until this day, that she had ever seen it?
Ailin Solomons, again, looked at her feet.
At least 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and exciting twenty-year investigations working in Ofnov, the non-state monitoring system of the Public Land, prepared a short article on the overliving of easily and centrally several violent acts in the fields of the country where its disaster or direct suspension had been expected, at least, when its delay was made available for money and energy.
“It has been done much and much more to do,” wrote she, “to calm down the native aggressive people who fight in many wars and most of them, and especially in the disasters, hardly available lands, where and over the skins of coasts that go over the living flocks of human loyalty.”
However, some things are incompatible.
It could be thinking that the higher is the steel wind, so it's lower than the pudding.
The residents are driving over the sensitive balances, hearing the fair story and pronounced that they believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that the old brutality in rural areas remains firmly like in cities, but evidence also show that the house, work, forces, and even on sports, is shown new and ancient disagreement.
“You have a tendency to a long-term style, ” said her superintendent.
I'd like you to read less Romans.
Esme Nussbaum cut his head.
I have to ask, "You're a atheist?
“I know I don't have to answer it, ” announced Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesba?
We're raising up our right to private and smoking.
Feminist?
Next silence.
“ I don’t ask for this, ” says Rabinovitz, “I have something against the atheists, lebbys or feminists.
We don't have advice on this work.
We are serving unprecedented companys.
But a certain kind of overseer that is very acceptable and honorable of himself can sometimes draw the judicial as you have brought it.
Obviously, you are self-predicted by the church - things you call "cross" and "brutal" could also interpret others as the expression of natural forces and energy.
It still decides to resolve CO SE STALO, KDYBY SE STALO, as if it happens, yesterday, it prepares the land with its basic life force.
While Rabinovitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
After his head on the light table, the recommendation that Ofnow sent to the world in the last fourth century or more.
Smile on the room, watch your partner, listen to balady, walk on musical, use your phone, convert, explain, agree, forgive.
Talking is better than lying, singing word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
“I just understand your expenditures, ” answered Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her superintendent ended, “and I don't say that the moon wasn't agreed as we're thinking about it.
My fear, especially, is that if we don't have warned this, we repeat the same error that has made to, CO SE STALO, KDYBY SE STALO.
But this time we're not going to win on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz's fingers.
That was supposed to mean infinite patience.
“ You are too far, ” said he, “if the steps that may have done and may not have done your birthday, you describe as errors.
It's too far that you're talking about their “relief ” and“ unbelieving ” to the last.
I wouldn't have to remind anyone on your place that we are not talking about "nos" and "nos".
There was no "we" and there was no "one".
We only know that it's about chaotical times.
“ In those who, if we are honest to us, ” exclaimed Esme, “We are no one without sin.
I'm not accusing anybody.
If it was just or not what happened, it happened.
It was before.
It's not what to add - we agree together.
And as there is no sin that would be done on someone, there is no things that should be corrected, neither if the transport would be appropriate and possible.
But to what others it is former than to learn from it,
The past exists to forget her.
If I can add something to this...
Luther Rabinovitz broke the ends of the balls.
“I'll take your message in mind, ” said he, "I'll take care of it."
The day when she went as usually to work, he smoked her a motocycle, who found it on a walker in a way who described as a "brutal and wedding."
The agreements are happening.
The army of the Lesoth Kingdom says that no pump plans - the President of the Government remains in South Africa
The military officers of the Republic of Lesoth said that they would organize a puzzle for the purpose of the government, and say that they had acted against the police understood by trying to armed political fanatics.
The President of the Government Thomas Thabane escaped from the country and says that the army turned around his official seat and contained government buildings in the main city of Maser.
After he announced that they died to him, the premier went away with his family to the neighborhood South African Republic.
The speaking army Master Ntle Ntoi said that it was not really a puzzle, but the answer of the army to the exchange of “political fanatics” who tried to armed the police.
“ Today morning the Kingdom’s defensive folders of the Republic of Lesoth worked after a number of reports of information services received that in the orders of the police are a number of groups who are planning to armed some radically, political fanatics that had been able to create in the country more, ” said the vote of the United States.
Clayson Monyela's South African government said that military actions appeared to be as a trial to reach the government.
“Nobody declared that the government powers were held through force, in accordance with all the cases of the lesoth protection materials of the state transmission,” said.
The soldiers of the Republic of Lesoth said that the soldiers returned to their chair and in the main city was quiet.
In Thaban's disorder will be a responsible Vice-Premier Mothetjoa Metsing.
Thabane announced that, according to his opinion, it was a threat to fight against corruption in the land.
Since June, Tabane stopped the meeting of the Parliament because of the internal sports, he ruled in Lesoth.
He announced that, even through a defense, he doesn't support his government's action.
Production in the euro area is at least thirty months
The growth of the products, according to the sustained investigation in the Eurozone, has decreased at the minimum of 13 months.
The final index of the buy managers in the Eurozone (PMI) from June 51.8 was held in August at 50.7.
The number is higher than 50 means expansion.
New negotiations and businesses have been raised increasing infringement between the EU and Russia because of Ukraine.
The numbers come from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The railways will want a clear plan to achieve the remote eurozone health and with severe deflation with inflation rate of 0,3 %.
The speculation was found that the Director of the ECB Mario Draghi, perhaps this week, had indicated that consideration of quantitative freedom of euro zones, similar to whom the United Kingdom and the United States have arrived during the financial crisis.
“In the least some growth is better than no growth, a weak effect that has growing economic and geopolitic immorality on the manufacturer is still visible,” said Rob Dobson, the main economy Markit.
The producer of German PMI, the largest trade partner of Russia in the EU, falled on the eleventh monthly 51.4.
In the second largest area economy, France, PMI falled at 46,9.
The concern is about France, Italy has gone out of the expansion of this stagnant.
The knowledge of the creation of the growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, too, is not too quiet, said Dobson.
The discharge of the industry may probably apply oil into the fire analysis expecting the implementation of other monetary or monetary stimulations.
One positive report came from the Ireland Republic where the PMI grows at 57.3, the highest level from the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economy in IHS Global Insight, said: "This is the best thing that is about the production of purchase managers for the money to say is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
Additionally: Productors in the euro area are very comfortable in the present life, because the increased geopolitic infringement, especially between Russia and Ukraine, is still added to restrictive conditions in many countries.
This higher non-profit business has been decreased, and it is, in particular, the confidence of consumers, which is likely to make some agreements to be deposited or even interrupted, especially those costs.
He stated that as a “reasonable more probable”, the ECB will finally be carried out a form of quantitative release, "but we expect that it is only limited."
Ten years of hell living from Beslan: Ten years from the entire school of children still do
10 years ago, the Czech Radial in the school in Beslan in South Russia was arrested by thousands of people.
During the suffering that remained three days and the world shot was killed more than 330 people of which more than half of children
We returned to Beslan to look for some of the victims who were unclean during the faith in the school of death.
Just 10 years after the worried school in Beslan, 334 people died, including 186 children, warned yesterday the more alive heroes before the new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they took and killed fanatical terrorism children and parents, it appeared to be the deepest day of hell.
Rebellion on tragedy associated the east and the west, which led in this catastrophic disease to act and future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in South Russia to search for some of the victims who were unleavened during the death school.
We have found a wonderful young people who have suffered troubles, even though the reminder of the hell caused terrorists in them will live forward.
What is their biggest friendship?
To make a war that now misss the Ukraine, and in which children as they died, it's already done.
A girl who trys to go back to the dead school train
She was arrested by the main Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only trying to get back to the bombing school after she exploded the bomb.
Aida's crazy looked for her mother Lariss, which is now 40.
They were afraid they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“ My wife told me to escape and save life, but I couldn't, ” said Aida once.
I had the feet from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
He saved her soldier.
After several operators, she thought she had already been healed, but yesterday said: “The three months ago, the pain was returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to get another operation.
I've stayed in the front of the shoes.
Her goal is to be a sugar to help people as a doctor helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but she hasn't decisively destroyed it," she said.
“ It just happened to me, and it doesn't change.
One year I'm going to a witch to remember those who stay there.
Otherwise, we're trying to not talk to the friends.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and a future companion from Gapoe's class killed there.
As a little we played together and imagined how we're going to school together.
“ I don’t want to go to the school until I'm finished and started a career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she's not forgotten, but she remembers a little bit white every year.
I'm glad that many people in the world are still remembering what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we got from the British and other countries.
When I look at my photos, as a lease of school windows, I say that many people will first see it, they understand the katastrophy, and cut it back.
The boy who uniformed the rain and believed his mother's dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia kids start school in seven years) and survived the classic clothes of school in the area of their mother Tamar.
At that time, the seven-year-old said, “Mum told me that if she had a explosion, I have to lie on the ground and keep it on his hand."
After the explosion, he thought my mother died.
She said to him, "Still."
He feared that she was dead, escaped and saw a smoking ball, fell down the kid in his hand and fled a smoke.
His father Vladimir, who took him outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was advised to freedom and living in the hospital with the feet broken, and she thought her son died.
After they met again, she said: “I prayed for happiness.
I couldn't believe that.
He came in and found me.
Damir then went to London (sub the news of the World), where he was the first president of Tony Blair and his wife Cherie spoke to win Bernardo's Children.
"This weight is returning every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," said yesterday.
But I can say that the reminders are almost swallowed.
I remember I've got all my guns on the play.
But today I can play computer games in which they're shooting, and I have no problem with that.
“ I don’t be afraid to go back to the throat, but I don’t think of myself.
I remember the kids I played at the door and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they killed them or died.
We're saying they're staying lowly.
I remember, at the past to London, how I could choose what I wanted, and how I went to the cabriole.
Now he's afraid of a place like Ukraine, where the war is suffering as he and his friends.
This weight is returning every day, but I'd like to stop thinking about it.
“ I'm so sorry for everyone who has to go through such a grievous way, ” says Damir, who participated in the workers of the last week.
I want to help too much.
One time I want to work with the police and I hope I'll take me to academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “Have killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember this silence immediately after the attack, there were no kids who would cry and cry here, and that was still a few months.
Life remembers the way with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people wept.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her position for the price made and for the possibility to go to London after 2004.
I'm sure I can call Cherie and say personally that even though it's 10 years ago, I still remember meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember what Damir had on the bottle, and they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played in the restaurant, Damir shoot them from the water gun and they fled and played with him.
And it was just a month from that weight.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world has not changed the best for those ten years.
Now it's a war in Ukraine, people die every day and I think it's still killing many children.
They're the same children like those of us.
I think the war for many people is only something in the reports that they hear when they are naked or doing something else.
I know what these people live, what's the worst.
I still feel that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown, and he's a sweet and quiet boy, he's not very aggressive or arrogant.
For example, it doesn't take it on the ground, it doesn't care about him.
I know she doesn't remind it, but she's very close to six partners and time from time he's going to smoking and burning lights there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with that -- I remember how he had sometimes lie on the galaxy with the face turned away from us, and sometimes he was so laughing for hours.
No sleep, he had open eyes.
I also remember that he cut all his guns or other weapons on the game. Damiro is 17 today, he's higher than I, beautiful, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I've been sure he's dead and I'm never seeing him anymore.
When I remembered the explosion and stood up on the feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were all people's bones.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have this hell of chance to survive.
“I remember how I cried, 'Damire, run, run!' but I was convinced that he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and fled.
So our life is different from others.
Gregorie Ilyin, 17
The boy who made a photo after the attack became a symbol of the grid in Beslan
Path: Living from Beslan Grigorie Ilyin with his mother Fatimou after a attack in 2004, right to Gregory today
When he fled from the life after the waiting terroristic shot his fellows, he was in his bloody face of serious fear.
His photo was one of the most amazing symbols of beloved animals in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the doctor, sent him on the first day at school and quickly took her old son Vladimira to the university.
“I went out two minutes before the terrorists went to the door, so my boy left there three days, ” she remembered.
Not exactly because we had a relative there, but they all died there.
It's just over my Grigory.
As the date is close, it's still hard to think about it and talk.
It's not the only day that we don't remember this tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that's happening for a long time, I feel that it was yesterday, some moments I'm still going back.
I promise no one will forget.
Remembering still: Photo Grigorije (left) was one of the most spectacular images of the attack and was used as soca (right)
I remember how Gregory's day was very happy in school, he said he wanted to take his teacher.
She's alive, I learned when I saw him in the TV.
In San Marinu, there's even a smoke of Gregoria.
Grigory looks at this photo, and we've got her in the book.
I understand it, but I also think that the picture of people in the world knows what pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “The matter is that it is important that it will not be repaired anymore.
“ I feel that sometimes we know the truth.
Such tragedies are still investigating, but no one will find the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing boeing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what was the reason?
This world's waiting for something very bad.
“ I don’t understand why it happens, because when people ask, nobody wants war, how is it possible?
Ten years are nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little, he needs ten years.
It had the effect on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had because of the attack of the night, but then it was better.
Then when I returned to school in 2004, I was amazing every day.
I thought of my friends and friends who killed them.
That's why when it's close to September 1, I'm going to the steel.
I want to worship a friend of childhood.
It's hard for me to get into that witch, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is an old.
I don't forget that, but I can't.
My life's going forward.
I've finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkas.
I want to be cardiochirurg.
First, I wanted to go into the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of health I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't.
Grogorie Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even holding him at the feet of a murder terrorist.
Wizard: Gregorij Farniyev was held during the attack at the foot of a murder terrorist, however he could survive
When he was attacked in a full exchange, he was held in prison in the heat as he sits near the bombs at the feet of a murder terrorist.
It's a real surprise that's over.
“ It looks like if it was yesterday, ” said Gregory, who wanted to be a federal service agent, but because of the suffering that he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me. It's not something I've got behind my head.
Now I'm elder, and I'm saying that the children with bad interests can make better -- I have to say that it's not true.
“In 2006, I went to psychologist and then was a bit better, but I can't forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - this year - it was the first and the last thing I reached to the heat.
I'm leaving.
I'm never going there again and don't want me to show you where I'm seen a well known image.
Living: Gregorij Farniev today, on the notebook with its photographed in the hospital after attack
This pain is big, and it's gonna take her every day.
Friends know that I'm not going to think about it, or I'm talking about it, and they never ask me at school.
What about physical health, I'm okay.
I have to be careful for my phone I've planned, but I'm going normally.
But so I couldn't get in and study FBS at Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was not possible.
My next cocktail is animals, so I'm getting on the veterin.
I've done there the second year.
He's learning how to treat all animals from the "wheel after the roof."
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something that the children should know, and it's not anything they should live.
Her mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside, and he's deceived with the neighborhood.
Meeting the memories of ceremonies.
I know Grigory's not going.
It must be stronger for him because he was in the difference from me.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful that he returned him here in Beslan are the feet all around.
It's gonna stay with us.
Gregorij's growing today, but he's driving down here.
It's hard to accept when something happens to you so terriblely wrong.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his neighbor.
He's undergoing a few operations, he can go, but he can't smoke.
I'd say that it's about 50% of the crazy, but I'd say that it's completely, and forget it's not.
This terrible experience will still be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors killed, and it just hurts.
I lost many people I liked and they were near me.
My son is with me and this is the biggest gift that God could give me, but he hurts me to lose the dead.
I know the families in which other children were born, but also widows that were not reached.
It's hard to accept that life continues even if you don't want.
I'll never forget how my heart was scared out of the crazy when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I take care of what happens in the world -- wars on other places.
Why are those people fighting?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now close to our country that I can believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many kids in Ukraine were and they'll be killed.
If we could get all these rebellions and cut them off, however, it's going to happen.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
Child who came to safety special command
Saved: Alion Tskaev is in a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy.
The world in 2004 wept after the rain when the small Alion was carried out of the Russian officer.
The terrorists left her, but in the school, they left her 30 - year - old mother, Christin’s decade and his brother Machara.
Machhar, in which there were three years, united, Alionin’s mother and sister died at the masker.
Her brother Ruslan was married again and with her new wife of the World have a girl called Christian after the dead daughter.
The companions say that Alyona, who's now ten, doesn't remember the attack and has grown from her a beauty and a happy girl.
A neighborfriend announced that “the family is a great happy family, and Alyon and Machar are beautiful children. ”
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep children far from the reminder of the tenth year.
You can understand why.
A man committed by shooting girls to transfer to signs in Fife
Eighty-year-old man before the judge, for the transition of the signs in the neighbor Fife shot a three-year girl.

4 types as under water order better photos and videos
If you're interesting on photographing or packing under water, you have a great choice of savings.
The best options are compacted as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or outdoor camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are at about 300 dollars.
I made these photos on a family hole of a few photographs, all stayed less than 350 dollars.
It's one of which you use, but for the best results, a number of rules will be paid.
Check your packs.
Although you have a water camera, you may ensure that battery and other parts are completely closed.
Continue set the photographer according to what type of photo or video you're going to sort.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or packing mode that optimizes the dark environment under the water.
And before you leave it, you'll find out how deep you can gain your rescue.
Some cameras are defined only to 5 steps, more to 50 to 60.
Read our owner by the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in a regular and water execution.
Always make a few photographs, it's not a lot of them.
Compact photographs have LCDs that will help you with photos, but outdoors do not have it.
Although you have LCD, under water, it'll be bad to see and the composition of the smoking will be invisible.
So always make more pictures.
If you have a photographing bracketing mode that makes a series of pictures with a lot of different exposure, use it.
Stay close to the honey.
The light is explicitly with the deepest sponsor.
If it is possible, keep on the photograph in the base, the ice or the sea near the hungry.
It also allows you to take more light photos - whatever you can do more deeply, so you'll see less colors.
Get close to the photographed object.
It's a wonderful advice if you're photographed on the floor, but under the water it's more important for the darkest light.
It is particularly important if you have an outdoor camera: such devices usually have a fixed and width core angle, which means that if you want to fill a photograph, you need to close more to objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man who could change things even in such a serious organization as NHS.
As anesthesiologist declared his carrier to lie from the disease of disease and treatment.
His wife reminds that one of the people who searched for his help was a MI6 director who had to live with the consequences of murdering him.
Lawson understood that while the doctor focused on diagnoses and disease, patients treated in the third party are most interested in something else: pain.
However, one day in 2007, he was the one who began to suffer.
“ I don't feel in my hair, ” wrote in May that year.
I felt without energy.
He's inclined to the signs of the shirts and found that she's indulgent and his wife's Juliette's officers.
He noted: "I want to do everything before later."
When Juliet went to a service way for a week, Lawson was usually unexpected and unexpectedly discovered.
Something wasn't okay.
The colleague made him a rentgen ringer.
A few weeks ago, he was lying in French Alpa.
The rentgen results arrived.
He had mezoteles, unleasing narrows that placed the ground or if the floor was spreaded.
In most of the kinds of race, it is hard to determine what was their cause.
Although some cookers have received a rack of fishing, not all patients with a raw fishing.
It's different.
At least in all cases, the structure of asbeth is the structured material that was marked as “writing”, but today it knows that it is in danger.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore the mechanisms.
Asbest, the ends, the past.
The most dangerous type of asbeth is not used in the United Kingdom since 60 years when he entered into the manufacturer of the use of asbeth in the industry.
Even during the time he was used asbestes, only some groups of people, such as isolators, structurers, teachers and workers in the boat.
Toxin used in the industry in another heart is hard today as a reason for fears.
It's so selfish, but it's not at the place.
As it is shown, in the United Kingdom the top epidemies of mezotelyomic epidemies are today.
The number of deaths on the mesoterals is higher than in any other country in the world.
2500 deaths for this disease year are two times more than the number of car car accidents.
Number of deaths on the results of the Messotelium a year since 1980 and decreased death in the future in the Great Britain
The reason why we now encourage his effects, although the use of asbeth is already unlawful for years (all of the types of asbeth were finally decreased in 1999), is that usually a few decades have been long before the mezotels are developed.
The groups in the form of mezotelium are not only relevant to the structure industry.
Asbest was, and in many cases, it's still in the houses where we live, in offices where we work, in schools where we learn, and in businesses we buy.
Mezotels therefore do not respect social level, richness, calling or age.
Privileged bathrooms from London's trade houses after public schools are not covered.
And the Parliament is full of asbeth.
Even the hospitals in which we should treat are the basement of this dead carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't think the isolation.
He tried to find out where he could come to contact with the asbeth.
Then he came to it.
"It may be a lot of asbest was in the subterinary gates of Guy's Hospital, where I had six years on praxis," wrote.
All were students, sisters, doctors, and returns used.
The question is how many of my presents will get the same disease?
It was a question that he made a party answer.
“The four doctors who were in the Praxis in Guy's hospital and were with those who were in the past five years,” he noted in the letter in 2010, "I am the only one to live."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was with the mezotel diagnostic when he was 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not so long.
55 per cent of people diagnosed with mezotelium will die for eight months from diagnosis.
The disease is always dead.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: "How many of us are the same disease?"
According to the Previous British Department on the Messothely Professor Juliana Peta, the best reputation is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbest epidemies are reached in the United Kingdom, about 900,000 people die.
Most of them in the present time have no idea that he will die in this way.
Azbest Delta in Quebec, Canada
In a regular view of the letters of the courts archives that are often rejected and required equipment, it shows how much the mezotelyomic group has expanded.
For example, this Red accepted Marks & Spencer's company that he made Janice Alleno's asbeth.
For a row worked nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she looked at two sales in the section with clothing - one of the locations was a boat ship on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when it started working for M&S.
He has two children today who are over twenty.
“ Before that happened, ” says he, “I never heard of the Messotelium before, I soon knew something about asbeth.
I've never thought in the dream that he could be touched to me.
There's no lot of people who know something about the asbeth.
In fact, there is no asbest one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name has received thanks to his fibrous structure that gives him power and power.
Three were used in the structure of six minerals.
Most of them today are possible to find crisis, usually known as a white asbest.
It was used in shoes panels, grounds, fighters, and even in shooting clouds.
The EU and the WHO are not as dead as other forms of asbeth, however, as a “great health risk” which can cause death.
It is more dangerous but heavy asbest (mosit) and blue asbest (crokydolit).
The British was the largest world importer of the cold asbeth and experts stated that “exists of persuasion, but unreasonable evidence that it was the main cause of not usually high exhibition to the Messoterium [in the United Kingdom].”
Marsk & Spencer's employment was established in balls sold in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of Messotelium, but the work of Julian Peta shows that her story is not usually incredible.
His patient studies say that “the other part of the events of mezotelium without a known exposition of asbeth in the work or home was probably caused by asbeth in the environment”.
The significant part of this exhibition is caused by the “normal use and lightning” building.
Looks like no one can't be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, who tested the Westminster's ball, shows that no people in the middle of the government should be surprised that they may be established asbeth.
In 2009, Goddard published the report, according to which services and consumption in the rooms of the Parliament Committee, was contemporated by asbeth, which a deadly threat could be dismissed to something such as the “sufficient air consumption”.
The Ministers are often convinced that they only take care of their own interests, in this case, but it may be true.
Although the Directorate of the Ministry of the Parliament continued to receive the Westminster's packaging “the precise medical tests”, it is now calculated that it will need a million liberes and a few years of work to look exactly, the Parliament has promoted the electricity and removed the asbest, and that the elections in 2015 will be messengers be less than on the green lavies in Westminster to sit in the Conference Centre of Albania II.
The report of Goddard states that “the price of asbeth is not in accordance with a few provisions”.
You can't say if this is not like this would become life.
Everybody can wait now.
One of the persons who had never been able to determine when they came to the exposition of asbeth, is Graham Abbott, the doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is surprised that he was raised at the work of hospitals.
“ I worked in the hospital where the atmosphere was declared, ” says, “but I can't show it in my case.
It's hard to remember everywhere he worked, and when he worked there.
But he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when something happened to him.
He was 45, he was evening, and he was just in the middle of the operation.
I was on the first time.
It's coming.
I was terrified.
I thought I didn't go home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was gone out of the hill, the springs around the fish.
But as Janice Allen did not have reason to think she was about the mezoteles.
Finally he worked home.
The lack of doctors made him rentgen and brought him a wreck catering to remove him from the file that they sent to the debat.
But they didn't urge the diagnosis.
His status was quickly improved and returned to work.
But his symptoms were returned from time, often after he was rejoiced and rejoiced.
In 2011, one of Abbott patients came to the operational room with similar signs and, afterward, he was diagnosed with mezoteles.
Nevertheless, Abbott had nothing connected with his own case.
Finally, his patient was about a few ten years old, and in the work he got a right contact with the asbeth.
In this case, it was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott’s status was rebuilding and his doctor consulted his photos from CT and rentgen with the officers panel.
In 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling bad, he was in the space between the steel of a rubber dutin and the spring of the file brought by the sane camera.
I'm optimist.
I have nothing to do so much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, she was worried.
The results of the biopsie have occurred between the Sunday and the New Year: "They told me that it's a mesoterial."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostics with mezotelium
Abbott started met with her sisters with the charity organization Macmillan and one advised him to contact the lawyer.
He knew the epidemic ratio in that moment.
“It was shown that asbest was completely used, especially in large public buildings that often have a asbest’s titsue isolation in destruction, ” says.
For people who were established in these buildings are now starting to demonstrate the disease.
Mezotely, now, begins to belong to younger people who do not have risk calls.
The most dangerous cuts that were infected in the hospitals were in the sutheren, so it was impossible that patients were threatened.
In particular, members of the subterraneous traveling travelled between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or eating in suternal foods (come often Graham Abbott) were sure to contact the toxic substance.
As it is now shown, there were a few ten years after the war of the hospital, where patients could save life, but also a place that could cause the life of doctors who were treated them.
Asbest's going to be removed in the day.
The requests of Bunsen's kahan were established on the asbest bases
And it's not just about the hospital.
Azbest was often used in offices, businesses, books and advisers because of his great isolation and disappointment property.
In schools too.
In fact, a lot of people were already set up in school.
Sometimes, in a few hours, the chemicals of the students made Bunsen's kahan on the asbest base.
The web pages were occupied with asbeth in schools.
Increasing things, such as the basic perjudication or the shoes of the neighbors in our houses, were usually contained asbests.
“It is about the industrial food built into a large number of houses,” states Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who attached Andrew Lawson in his prison against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the asbeth, on which a woman of suffering mezotelium had been able to remember in 70 years when the garden's house was broken.
So watch how you fight the garden house.
I know that the disease is inadequate, it's an impact of diagnosis.
Graham Abbott says: “The minute remains before it happens to you, ” says.
I came back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I was on the operating room two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and get myself.
Well, I don't get the other night.
One of the most difficult things was a transition from the doctor position to the patient position.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how he felt disgusted from the quantity of information he had to be raised.
“ It was hard to understand everything, ” says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long is it for me?"
I was told that 12 months.
I remember how I said: “Well, I don’t have any other night.
That's it."
Mezotels are particularly destroyed, because the same mechanism of what he keeps us in life - self-respiration - is what makes the racoon that kills.
Most cases of mezotelium are caused by asbeth.
Asbest creates a smoke.
When the asbest is smoking and smoking, they can be used in the hills, the plant of fish.
Asbest's smoking stealing, and they can choose the muta cells.
“The problem represents an enhanced asbest smoke in the front of the steel," explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardiochirurg, who came to Guy's hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was obviously designed asbeth, which is a paradoxic leader centre in the medicine.
The Treasure Lawson knows and he also treated other patients who were likely in the hospital.
The asbests are achieved in the fishing box, says Treasure, and “the similar respiration is pressed on the border where the steel is located.
His opinion is invasive from the same beginning.
The normal medicine options used in other types of racoons are not so much killed on mezoteles.
The challenge is discussed, for example, of the efficiency of the operation.
Some would stay for trying.
The love is unlikely.
"You can't remove the hill," says.
You're not gonna get a shield around her.
Rakovina “a friend doesn’t respond to chemotherapy ” which has any effect but does not treat.
“ Sometimes someone who survives the fish, ” says Treasure.
But finally, everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer than they expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and half years from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After finding the Messotelium, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years since his diagnosis, became individual support and adviser for the same visited people.
When they called, he said, “Good day, you have called you to the center of the cockpits.”
“I was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnostic for four years ago and he was still very active.
At the beginning of Abbott, they offered six chemotherapys that would remain for four months, and they probably would have spend his life only for a month.
"I was low," says he.
I wanted to give it.
But Lawson made things to show in the optimist light.
After visiting a few doctors, Abbott decided to continue in treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the division of a hurry chirurg in the hospital Guy's hospital.
“ I had an agreement that I had not to wait until I sent me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," advised Graham.
The normal patient should have received a request and should approve the office.
In order to get to the best available treatment, it is for patients with mezotelium a key question.
But when different treatments are finally unresolved, many patients have a new financial parent - about the future of the family left here.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“From 1898, it was known that Azbest was healthy,” says Morgan.
However, in the 60s, it was found that his very small quantity could represent health risks.
And here we're meeting the weakness of fire.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital were finally equipped, but, according to Morgan, it was not a “full expression” because Lawson couldn't definitely demonstrate that the Messotelium was the result of the exposition of asbest in Guy's hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, Guy's hospital confirmed that the "incrimined subterinary part was removed in 90 years."
That was for Andrew Lawson too late.
How to remove the skin
The exhibition of a dead asbeth on one companie or instead of work - usually ten years after that - for patients with mezotelium that encouraged compense could be a serious problem.
A lot of old employees have changed the owner or has been shortered.
Providence's achievement has lost.
And those who are now accused of the defense are on their side of time, and their bondmen are decisively not.
In response to this year, the important new legislation was approved, which is easier for patients with mesoterium to be equipped, even if they are not possible to examine their old employer.
The Law created 350 million financial reserves which plays insurance, which is defined by people diagnosed after June 2012, which can demonstrate that they were made asbesto, but they do not ask any of them.
In such cases, 80 % of the parts of the court would be able to be compared to them in normal case, about 120 000 liter.
Each year is expected for 300 successful requirements.
Andrew Morgan is the same as patients with mezotelium thinks that 350 million books are " good work".
“It's a agreement established insurances,” says and indicates that the summa is the fourth of what the security should be paid if he had no time and people with the media would be able to pay the old employer and normally invite them.
Even Mike Penning, ancient minister of work and social things, recognized that the law was “the spaces.”
But Penning and Morgan suggest that, in view of seven deaths each year, a fast operation was required.
“ People too much suffering and help need immediately, ” said Penning, during the second reading of the mezotelium law.
Graham Abbott was in 19 months of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After the initial consultations, the Lang-Lazdonski operation recommended that it was a distinction from Tom Treasur that he had a positive effect.
After operation, the radioterapie and chemotherapy followed - three treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski could be able to achieve five years to 40% of patients.
Abbotta put it up.
“ Of course, this is not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You're still seeing this in patients.
There's something that's going to move you.
When you go away, your status can be very quickly hurt.
Graham Abbott submitted operation on March 2012.
At the end of August, he finished the last of six chemotherapy.
The control spectacles had no signs of disease.
I went to another control on March [2014].
I had a lot of shoes [racoons].
My 50-year-old birthdays just closed.
It doesn't risk life.
Bee ho to.
Abbott reached six chemotherapy cicles.
In the present time, there are no pets in his body.
But it's physical and emotionally exciting process.
You have to think about practical things - on financial assessment when I'm dead, or to show a woman how it works on the kitchen.
When you see bad messages, you'll start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
Like Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14) it's not always easy.
“ It's hard for parents, ” says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnology, I said hooks that my status means I'll never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is a lot of society and amazing.
She said that to friends, and once began to call us a lot of people.
Ellie was more maintainable.
She didn't say so much.
Such conversations must be fulfilled by all patients with a kidney.
In patients with mezotelium, such conversations are not exceeding hope or only the sign of the possibility of survival.
The disease brings (and finally brought Stephen to Jay Gouldo).
As Andrew Morgan says, “It doesn't cause life. ”
She's the bodies of the faraon's broken into the asbest plattine.
Asbest skins are used to ensure the branches for the vaccination and increase the difference against the egg.
Plinius Ancient describes the assessment.
She's found a technology that's not crazy.
I saw her manufactured robbers that were cut in blood on hostinas.
In Italy, asbest is started to appear in commerce use, used to produce papers (in addition to banks) and tkanin.
Great asbests are opened in Canada and South Africa, soon then in America, Italy and Russia.
In industry revolution, it's a great isolated substance in par motors and turbines.
The world production of asbesto is increased in more than 30 000 tonnes per year.
Statistics of the Security Pridencial Officers shall ensure people who work with a higher mortality, and they will then be rejected by life safeguards.
In Rochdale, Nellie Kershaw dies.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the party of the asbeth in her files were “the cause of her death. ”
It's the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employees, Turner Bros Asbestos, denied responsibility.
They won't pay any equipment.
During the Second World Wars, the ships are intensively established, the work in the ships represents the highest risk of the asbeth design.
Proceedings for import of blue asbeth
The Court of Revocation confirms the first successful request for the health results of the exposition of asbeth in the United Kingdom.
The world production of asbesto is increased in more than 4 213 000 tons per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tons.
The United Kingdom for Health and Security requires the licence of all additional asbeth.
Imports and use of blue and cold asbeth are prohibited in the United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, the use of all kinds of asbeth is deleted.
The United Kingdom shall enter into force of the law on the mediator.
It's running 350 million compensation program.
Azbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, however, in many parts of the world, the white asbeth is still used as a low structure material.
The world's production is holding for two million tonnes year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the authority to choose guidance - demonstrators promise the defense
The Chinese Parliament, on the basis of the multiple debate on democratic reform on the week, decided to not allow the choices in Hong Kong to nominate candidates to the election in 2017.
This step is likely to choose long promised protests in Hong Kong's business quarter, because the actives began to organize and capture a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese Human Congress, based on, allows communist leaders to organise any candidate that is not loyal to Beijing.
“ You didn't surprise us, but it was disturbing us, ” said the lawyer Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Sites.
That's not what Peking promised.
People in Hong Kong missed.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authorised mode.
On the protection of the Chinese Decision, the Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National Human Congress of Li Fei said to allow public nominations in the options of Hong Kong 'caos'.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned China by the Hong Kong Manager, Peking promises that the beginning of 2017 will be able to call the fulfillment power.
The Chinese leaders presented a democratic decision as a democratic approach, since Hong Kong allows direct vote, but the decision also clearly shows that the Chinese leaders of the representatives are firmly maintained in the procedure of nomination of the Committee, which is directly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clusters will only be the candidates who love the land and the Hong Kong.
The decision came after a period of months that one of the largest and most follow-up protests in Hong Kong for a few years.
For the majority of pro-demokratic protests in Hong Kong, the Occupation Centre with love and peace which the organizators have held the closement of the financial fourth, if Peking does not give them the general vote law.
On the evening, only a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of the rainers in the rain were gathered together before the Government of Hong Kong.
At the demonstration of the organizators, their steadfasts enter into the new fase of citizen incompatibility and that in the past weeks they start full protests.
However, they did not provide any further detail, but they were obviously wanted to exceed the issues of the office.
In their Internet declaration, the organizators said that the challenge “received the Occupation of the Centre only as the last step in the case of all the options of the dialogue, and there will be no other choice.
We need to notify the policy that today all the options of the dialogue have been disappeared and the contents of the Centre is inevitable.
The Offices in Hong Kong were prepared for Beijing every day and on the weekend sent the government's seat, and the police and barricades were assembled.
The removing of diseases, according to many Hong Kong citizens, notices that a short loss of control over the city.
It allows people from the firm to increase competition in the area of products and services.
It is also afraid that the values as democracy and freedom of words are higher with the pression of Beijing.
Some people criticize the occasion of the Centre of Opupation and say that their demonstrations are threatening the trade - the safe member of Hong Kong.
“Protest, about which he speaks, could cause a greater economic affliction according to how many people are participating and how long,” says Regina Ip policy, which criticizes long-term distress.
We don't want to expand the fear that Hong Kong gets outside control.
Such investment could be cut off.
In the last days, the Chinese State media also came to reports that democratic activities in Hong Kong are designed as under-back agents in the west.
In the age of activity, there were non-official references on voting rights in which 780 000 participants arrived – more than five volators in Hong Kong.
And in July, ten thousand people participated one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
A pre-selectable agitator?
Liga in Jihlava is named according to the political degree
Small cocktail games in the country city of High Highways at least 1600 Amaterian sports.
And their highest conscience is called a common name for Jihlav lion.
The name has received in accordance with a single step which is entered into the rural Community choices.
The tenth on his candidate is also the boss of the little copy in Jihlava Jan Marak.
"It was a poor town where there was no problem," he brought the Mock Turtle.
The positions around the first small lies were already occupied by the lawyers of the Yugoslavia Council and recommended to change the distribution system.
A small cocktail got a lone on the website of the city about a million corners.
And it's about a number of hundreds of thousands of years.
According to the legal opinion, there is no small process in relation to the law or the Government Directives.
The situation is, but for the Office, to ensure the rules of addiction of grants and assessment,," the manager of Radek Tulis.
The questions from the city and the currently express as a small cocktail support in the choices of a political side, it may not go anymore.
At the high-face "grand" photoball, the policy's like requirement has not yet been arrived.
That the NGOs, ODS Division, or KDU-CHSL 1.
And the class and the similar counsel?
I wouldn't be for it.
In addition, I would like if the sponsors turned to us with a series of business," he noted the President of the National Football Court of Miroslav Vrzač.
Boss of small photoball other sides and shooting to the name of the lig does not leave
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would serve the own area with six sins, shadows and social equipment.
"For example, the skin on Stoups is not ours, we're in the town," advertised Ondrey Lapesh from Starlet Jihlava club.
The best locality would be the Chess Millon.
But it will be established there, for example, according to my opinion, an insensitive area for the boxes that are almost like fifty in Jihlava," advised the Mock Turtle.
Primator Jihlavy Jaroslav Exemplary (ODS) replied that a small cocktail uses a ship with a artely tree in the Russian streets and at Stoupaches that are in the town's room.
We want to build a build that has maximum use.
We need modernizing or designing sports in schools that will be available in the afternoon hours.
I think he did a great progress for a little cocktail for the last year," he added.
Another political sides in names are not shown according to John Murkey.
We have limited.
If someone comes to our partnership, we're not there anymore," he explained.
"The political breath in the name of the Lig, I think at least a bad step," said the Advisory Commission for Sport Karel Voldan.
"But the choicer decides whether Mr. Morak uses a small cooking Jihlava and questions the city for political purposes, or not," added.
America's tradition goes to universal life - First can fly with a press airport
We're happy that we can answer the first Luxembourg travel service for students in British.
In order to leave what the best achievement of the universe offers the company also the transport options, including the private cars or cars of Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also announced that the service has also its security page.
The service is ideal opportunities for students who would otherwise have to attach their things throughout the country in dangerously established car.
We're happy that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important element) variants this year, we'll ensure students that the universe will become the minimum nervous and most luxury.
The speaking company said that, in view of the service once started, they have no reserve, but he added: "The students will begin to reserve for several weeks."
The Community also showed that, although students pay a yearly school in 9,000 books, it expects that the service will find its place on the market.
In comparison with students before ten, twenty, thirty or forty years, the students today are others, as regards expectation and treatment - is more important than ever to make the correct first achievement and the VIF program is exactly the correct way to do it.
The National Union of Students was criticised as unable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for higher education, noted: “For most students, this project is inacceptable.
Many students who are at the universe this month must be able to get thousands of books for something so simple as to get on the road, equipped with financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of a monetary and grants will not be able to keep steps with the basic costs.
Feminists are established after events in Ferguson against rasism and policy behavior
At the beginning of the month, he killed a policeman in Ferguson in Missouri's unarmed younger.
And those who wait for the grave with their hands above, [their hands] shall be scattered: "Don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri, Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez was recorded in the online discussions of the White Feminists.
She discovered that when the reproduction of the rights and the equality of the accommodation, the white feministics are raised up before the race.
With the growing back to the Centre, which has been observed the entire pressure, Perez observed that the reaction of the blue is centered in 100% of the race.
In comparison with black reactions early after the 9th August, the personal articles with the titles such as the "Blue mental thoughts on Ferguson" or "Feminism is not only on the threat of women" have been discovered relatively later.
As the Perezian, it represents a significant change.
“I think it is not much of people who would talk about race and expenditure at such levels, ” she said.
People felt that to what happened, they had to say.
For the crisis we call, it's characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so rarely excited that they have to warn it.
According to the English professors in the State University of Ohiu Corithy Mitchell, Ferguson brought to the light of the problems that Africans have to fulfill each day and which in the cultural scene are not exploited as “Women Questions”.
"I can publish a funny story on Facebook with my partner and get 150 people from the whole world," said Mitchell.
When I write something about that colors are in their own country, it's quiet.
"How can a woman speak publicly about relations, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For the blacks like Mitchell, which had been questioning races, heads and sexuality in American history, there is no matter between the questions of race and the head of the apartheid.
The blacks were not able to achieve luxury in respect of these problems: they live every day in this amazing reality.
Although the white question of race and the heads of the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of the women's question and gender studies on George Mason University, says that their pre-education has made a deal.
Through the 1865 and 1890, at least 100,000 blacks were cut off, and the reason was at least in all cases of white depression," Hattery said.
You needed a white co-operation for the reason that you've got a white co-operation.
According to Hattery division between the whites and the blacks, when the fighters for the election law like Susan B. Anthony were investigated at the end of the 19th century, and they realized that the choice law could only have one group of women or black.
“They decided to set the cards on the voting law for women and to the right of blacks to meet later, ” explained Hattery.
When we know this, we get a important view of why the colored women don't believe in the white women.
We didn't have a good job.
We never helped the blacks to protect their husband and children.
Even after women had received the choice law in 1920, ten years before they began to organize against the struggling in the southern women for the prevention of the prevention.
The group took 40 years after the blacks first said about help.
According to Mitchell’s reactions of white feminists on the issues in Ferguson, a question of police conduct, rasical discrimination - reflects the time when the white feminists had to “accept” questions with the black-age.
“It would not be great if the activities on these [traditional feminism] were right to save the child seriously as the branches of the anticonception?", Mr. Mitchell.
The second feminists who have made carrier fight for reproductive law and access to anticonception are now discovered what it means.
Significant feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown by Facebook, where Rebeccy Carrolls were published from Guardian, which was required to protest the white Americans more rating against rasism.
“I hope that women who have different, but however, the reasons for the understanding of the dangers in society - and the opinions of the race that are in public measures are very different - will strengthen the change, ” wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem replaces intersectional feminism, which includes the questions of race and head, its comments on the question of race in America some mate people.
The American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book "Who robbed feminism?" said for She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of coloring men, are “increasing than their sisters, ” but the notes of Stein's side Ferguson's criticism that she had already chosen before.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but at least no children.
But when the White House started a small program Our Brother's Keeper, who had to help the rare young black and Spanish, called it to a lot of feminists, including Glorie Steinem's resolved reactions.
The policy to the black community is not the only problem that is achieved before the interest of the mainstream feminism.
After the United States border police held this year at the southwest country, at least 63,000 young people without the implementation, the question of the reform of immigration laws has reiterated - this time as a woman’s question.
Andrea Mercado, co-operating in Belong Together, a mobilising women organization for the reform of immigration laws, said that to be possible to ask as a question for women needed, the only thing she had to do was to share the story of the imigrant.
"We speak for yourself," says Mercado.
Considering that most of the work authorisations are made to men, women who are coming with them are raised in the position when they are rare, what is about home violence and disagreement.
“These story are in women's organizations,” she said.
Works in Ipswich for sale
The reality office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she opened it, he rested on it in the restaurant.

After the east of the lottery, Harvey has a city at the southwest of a billion billion
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
It takes a new billion at the southwest of Perthu, one happiness from the sabate taste of the lottery will take $1,1 million.
Trafikes in Harvey had been in the second time of the success in five years, last in November 2009 on the expenditure of a million dollars.
The happy officer has to log on now.
Steve Forward's business manager said he's talking about the outside of the town on the south of Perthu.
It's the main subject, and everyone's disappointment.
We thought the similar expenditure is on the box.
Eight guests in West Australia split one expenditure in the past month, which has forgotten a few happy weeks.
Last week, the player in Canning Vale became one of the five billions of Silver and only for a few weeks ago in Belmont won incredible 7,5 million dollars.
The victory twenty years old, and she said that she was able to process the world and buy a new house.

Vlaky Deutsche Bahn isn't going tonight.
The officers want to be higher
GDL in the print declaration marked the test for a warning stage for which he approved the time outside the transport pipe.
In the selected time, GDL takes a look at many people who return from the week after yellow until the first working day.
We also think of people who go for work during the day," he made the department vow on the morning in the print statement to the statement of the staff.
"Our first stage should be increasingly cost transport, less already walking," added GDL.
DB has not yet been published official reaction on the statement of the stages.
It is not clear how the protest action involves international fertilization connections, otherwise with the Czech.
The departments are required to increase the middle of machine drivers to five per cent and to reduce work time for two hours a week.
Currently, the average payment of machinery drivers is moved in the meaning of the processed years between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1,27 million corners).
The DB officers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to contribute to the growth of payments during the delay of work.
However, they assume that the mechanical evaluation of the machinery equipment should be issued as to the other fertilization personnel where the DB does not calculate the work weekly.
It's crazy that Krest's car's beginning to be moving.
That's why Barum Rallye's finished
What exactly happened?
It was about material vaccine.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
Does the exhibition not immediately repeat and continue in a short time to the service where the mechanisms should change it?
If we're going to get it right there, yeah.
But we were still waiting for two others, and it wasn't.
There's a high temperature in it and risk that the car's beginning to be hidden, it was great.
I can't allow it.
In full time, you got five speed tests.
What of them did you get?
It's very good.
I felt like a laugh.
We were fast, then I didn't go through win.
Everything was caused by the car to pill more than half year to be at some level.
The wedding showed that this was done to us.
You broke him so that you could really think about winning.
I've prepared myself and the car so that we really had on the expenditure.
The job wasn't coming out.
On the other hand, the result we could think was not enough.
But it's Barumk.
The technology said no.
You weren't the only one of the pigs who went out of the war of preventing.
They got out of him and the frontier favorite Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did you surprise that many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
In particular, for the wonders it was worried, because the ship has finished before.
He's been moved for a long time and Jaromir Tarabus, whose car you're getting.
He just paid that he fled out of the trait and took at least two minutes a mank.
How did you be happy with his execution?
It's threatened because he could repeat a lot of wines.
He's really interested in the first time.
But Mira also confirmed that we've got a good car.
He was very quick.
Just a year ago, you reported the end of the carrier, but you've discovered Barum Rally at the start.
Can you feel a good feeling from the car again to make a regular party of the rally commitments?
I'm sure it's not at this moment.
Loni said Barumk is my last order and I didn't get it.
I decided I'm going to get her back.
It was my last ninety-year-old start, and when it's gonna be a chance for a year, I'll probably go to that.
But I don't think of anything else.
A lot of people got to lose just because of you.
Have you been happy?
We just started just because of him.
Many people who are known or unknown, were still asked if I'm going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What are you waiting for Barumce?
The team continues.
The next week we'll go to the East where Robert Adolf will lead.
I hope that the car didn't have a lot of shit here.
Moreover, you're going to take the fabby of Honza Sikor.
With Miru, the European dualty in Switzerland and Corsice are waiting for us.
We'll have to get things on the next year.
Can you sign something anymore?
No, nothing is decided.
When Corsic Rallye looked at the mystery of the world, you got your maximum in the series.
You don't like to try the trace again?
I don't like it.
A external agreement with the employer may be a problem
You have not allowed you to make a doctor a confirmation of worklessness that serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot do for health reasons of work.
You didn't tell the employees immediately.
Finally, the agreement was concluded that the data will be evolved as a permitted, but the agreement has been only fully fulfilled.
Although the lawer does not have the obligation to let him literally confirm the agreement of the employer with the authorisation of the employee, he tested this procedure.
If only comes to the word agreement, you don't have a agreement on confirmation.
Afterwards, an additional agreement with the authorisation, such as in your case, is cut off and unexpected in the work as long-term absence, thus the reason for the immediate interruption of the work within § 53 of the Law of Working.
For the case of the Court's Agreement with your employee, there is no proof to prove.
Working amount with you, but not interrupted by § 53, you only have the data listed in the account list as an unexpected absence.
The non-provided absence in the account list does not have the same results as § 53 (e.g. the possibility of obtaining sustainability in unemployment), although it is difficult to search for a new employment.
We suggest you to visit the given doctor again and let us write to confirm that it actually has come to the challenge, in the consequence of the work you were inacceptable (e.g. "incomprehensive", is only about the doctor's evidence).
If you are looking for a new employment, you can introduce and explain the situation.
In the practice, it is not appropriate to assess the establishment of a written medicine confirmation on worklessness, such as the employee or the request of a letter agreement with the authorised currency.
You're looking for such a case of complications.
Tony Stewart's accident when returning to the train
Return to the track ended for Tony Stewart's only a rock for half the Atlanta Motor Speedway.

Praha has chosen a new manager of taxi advisory, 12,3 million
Prague has completed the choice management on the new manager of tax service.
For 103 parking training, $12,3 million corners are reached a year.
However, for the same location for the taxi car drivers, he chose 150 thousand corners a year.
He reported the advice of Lukeas Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city was used by the managers' election.
Then the wind received a reward for a rate of 1000 corners per year.

"Before the establishment of the original price agreements and the launch of election management has been demonstrated that the new provisions system is lower and more justified for Praha," says the advice.
The most oldest flex is in Perstytina
The highest price offered the interests of the advisory in the Road Na Perstein.
They'll pay 2.1 million corners for year.
At least 1,5 million of new managers sold a place before the Public House or Vaclav's destination.
The new rules of advice were adopted by taxis services at the end of 2012, and in the year of the lonely year, the original legal agreement was considered.
The election management was held in four bodies and a new manager found 29 opinions.
The second year we had to clean the source.
We've made it all out of all that we've made it out, which was practically the second fish around the chat.
Then we found Savo there.
Incredible pug!
Our bowl in the bowl was always getting pretty military waters.
And it wasn't a kidney done well, and the grandfather made her own help.
It's a long time.
She was just like three shirts and totally soldier, like the rest of everything on the chat, but as I say.
The water was great.
To the airport.
When we got the sezon, of course we broke the water.
When she stayed there a few months, she served it.
Only then we seemed that the water wasn't going.
We've been thinking if something wasn't over there.
In the place where it was gone, it was possible at a few smokes, that the board wasn't over there, so it was opening the safe cup of the smoke.
Our inspection confirmed that it's hungry.
Otherwise in the water was nothing to see, and we've lighted it up until the day.
So we got her out and cleaned her again.
Of course, we've improved the improvised threat around the balls.
We've all been in the bed, but we've been wonderful things.
On the ground, he's lying with some bones.
That's at least like that.
And on the other side.
Now it seems like an oxygenous mouse.
In the woods, in the places where the ships are, the grandfather's explosion, there were the fish rests!
And it's hard!
Our skin is also selfish.
Somebody would say that your grandfather had a chat.
And it wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the bottom are just a smoke, only the shoes are understood.
They're in the main ship.
A role.
And the lie on the plane.
Return with wide spaces was opened most like someone walked in one kitchen.
A few already mentioned products in the woods.
Without a network, so they usually treat birds, and on thresholds, they'll make a skin.
The Mouses are too much to smile.
Baby wanted to fly it, and that's it again.
But now he didn't help any air.
The entire ball has gone.
So we cleaned the whole skin.
Especially that fish on the train was worthy!
We spread out the things that were around: a plot, a heraklite wood, and so.
Our chat has been welcomed to the desinfek disinfek room.
We thought who could find us those weird rests there?
The nearest dog lives two kilometers from here in the town.
She'd be hard to celebrate us.
My grandmother fell on a suit that's not completely okay.
If he's the Franta didn't cut us in the ship?
It's practically here throughout the year, the stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to watch and watch and control regularly.
A few days later, it was all right.
We've started to use the water again, then just on the moon and the ball before they're ready tests, but it was good.
It's nothing I wanted to do for a long time.
One time we heard the horrible threat of our feet.
Mom was looking at the ballon, and she saw a lot of a strong black wheel in the ground near the verandy.
She shook her shooting and pioled as a footer.
Mom found her out because she thought Reza had gathered a smoke from the brain.
But the hadice was partly thrown into the club, and partly it was raised.
On the ballon, it's been cut off.
Reza got hissterical storage.
We've gone down.
The egg, a lot of longer over a metro, and a damn like a bull, was able to join a large robe, and Reza put her in it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save a robe or if she wanted to shoot her alone, but it wasn't enough.
When she saw the passenger in the form of our whole family, she probably said that we're going to get her so hungry when we're so hungry, and it's elegantely gone into the skin.
We flyed after her.
It's like a white shooting for a stuff.
It's just like that, we've signed another packaging on her dress.
It's like a fish.
I wasn't there before!
Our new security around it was a little shepherd.
And that's what we've been closed for a day.
That's...
We went out, and there were everybody to one travel.
We weren't waiting for a long time.
That's for the fucking stuff.
First, she appeared the board head with yellow months on the ring.
Then it's going to get out of the stuff of the whole use.
She turned around her shirt and started getting inside.
The employee took up, buyed notebooks and sold them
The sinful employee after the release was buyed on the computer company and then sold them.
The reached money was still trying to lose the police.
During a short time, the man buyed in twelve cases all sixty computers for more than two hundred thousand corners.
"Notebooks after a review, he moved to Olymouce, where he sold them by bathrooms," led the Supreme Commander of the Sumper Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of the employees were employees for freedom and also the cutting of money.
"In order to hear us, he said that the money used for credit payment," described Brückner.
The police also discovered that the leader was a patological player that he retraced his psychiatry.
The money could also be completed in exhaustive devices or in videolotherial terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money with him," said the Commander.
The leader who had already been punished for the rabbit is now terrible to stay in prison for a year to five years.
Policists still didn't deal if there was a terrible challenge to bazars who bought notebooks under the price and sold them.
"It's true that they're totally overcoming new bodies, which are at least surprised," stated the Commander.
However, none of the bazar leaders has been accused.
Come on, you'll get it, or how I've used We Run Prague.
Years have prepared a number of changes on us.
The biggest was the change of the travel that brought the target to the ground, instead of bringing it back to the Yellow cereals.
I was happy with the rest of the Rungo team, but I've got him to live so much from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided personally to heal our readers on the tent where we photographed together and grabbed videos.
To get his view from the other side to perfectity, I accepted the role of the personal waterer.
With the friend Cathoua, we were obeyed to the end of the curridor 60 to 70 minutes before starting.
We were welcome with the friends who traveled around us into the sector for faster running.
It wasn't a lot of time.
A couple of ships on the division, enable sports, repairs and start!
The challenges of the jacket, but instead of the fast start followed the suspect to the starting series.
After five minutes, we're standing at the door, we're shutting measures, and we're walking a time for ten hours.
We're going to prosecute the green wheels who run like Catha's first command.
Then all the lights appear to be, a little slow sun on the sky adds a look at the Highest garden nearly to the pitch.
It looks like she runs here all Praha.
On the border between the Highshared and the National Division, traditionally begins to demonstrate who has a power.
The easy coffee on the Palack Team to shoot a lot of drivers to shoot or go to the road.
Before I move to Divadel, I see the police guidance and immediately followed Paul’s incredible time to go to the target.
I hear the amazing respiration of other travellers.
I'm going to train the border, I build him up, I'm going to cry with me, but I'm stealing with my feet, and our hands are stealing with me.
Sebyh Divadel Street gives a chance for a short rest and respiration.
It's needed, there's places before us that looks for me.
The round on the Manezh Mountain shows Praha in all the beautiful amazing sun.
I don't worry and the feet are almost almost almost the same.
It's a minute of truth for the first purchase.
When Caitha moves the street, Caitha's smooth about the rubber and leads the shock of the plot.
I see if she doesn't need a help, and I'm starting a series of comforting words to not have time to think about pain.
It's coming and we're going to the Koza street, it's one of the worst places to lose, in this fashion, it's still not like that, but it's necessary to look well on the circuits.
I don't even know that I'm going to get a real sign later.
In the Port of Prash, we are frenetically strengthening tourists and friends of other ships.
I'm trying to click with everyone who offers his hand, and I'm going to say it, and Cate, because ten pressure with fans is like half energy tickets.
The fact is, we're going back, and we're getting very excited, now it's starting a smoking ship.
We have ten drivers, when I have someone especially humbled, I try to reveal him a few words, "Come, you can do it."
Nobody's going to prevent us, we're quick.
We've been running for hours and four, we're adding, it's nothing to wait.
Three kilometers to the target will be painted, but it's really needed to do it.
The sun has already fallen shortly, and the end of the day of the symbols ends shortly.
The last shooting on the shooter, the round, and just the round to the target.
The time we're running is going to guess me where to get it in that girl?
"Come, let's go under thirty hours, we'll have!" I'm calling.
We'll try it, print it, and it's the goal here.
Thirty and six seconds.
Well, what's going to do.
The Trener has set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under the plan.
That's a great result.
I'm going to help her to get a moment to rest.
It's to see her smoking, but also happy of a good execution.
After a while, I'll take her out of the target space.
Euforia doesn't think we're going to think about the bottom in the trains to the shadows.
Here's to see that the Kozzi street was not the worst place.
It's here for the purpose of the ship that is under the reform of at least 10 thousand driving driving.
If anyone doesn't like gifts, it's not a place for him.
And I'm going to think about if you're the beautiful views and turning the past years more interesting travel was stayed for what's happening in the goal.
From my own experience, I know that the order is not a league.
If ten thousand people are added to this, a rich implementing programme and the closement of the whole Prague Centre for all transport, it is a large explanation.
The air changes of the transport showed many interesting places that also brought several real surprises.
The great atmosphere explored in the Yellow Rainsfords has been moved between the room and the same.
Organisators around treatment and adoptional divisions driving it on every meter of treatment.
At the town's historical center, the poor must be calculated with the ransoms that can't remove, but the objective of mass destruction in the place that is at the same side of the walls and on the other river, I don't consider the best solution.
If I say that the lead has finished the goal, I value it as a very conductor.
I had a little fear for the health of the participated, but finally everything was fine.
Let us write to the discussion if the travel was liked to you and what you're saying about the situation in the goal.
Officers in Bulgaria organize protests
The centuries of prisoners in the entire Bulgaria participated in the global national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the main city of Sofia.
On peaceful demonstrations, their requests were repeated to re-reform the original work conditions changed recently.
On the list of requirements to be issued with the Ministry of Justice of Hristo Ivanove, they are also higher payments.
The observers of the month protested against the new work time and requested return to the original twenty-four-hour changes.
While the officers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice have not agreed, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
“Unitings are still running,” said the BNR Director of the General Directorate of the Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that the Protests of prisoners are also attached to the members of the officers' organisations of employees to the inner Ministry.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physicals are usually not writers, but Brian Green from Colombia's university was attached to the black trefate in 1999.
His book of Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for the lakes, how to explore the problems that are now concerned with theoretical physics - may be concerted two great workers, but incompatible events of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of the general relationship.
One of the causes of the success of the Elegant Universe is uncertain that, in the case of searching the association physical theory, there is no noble story.
The physical basic problem between two key teories (which in this moment our universe is actually divided in two worlds with different laws) and is so ideal that it is the transformation and the lakes.
Greene also advised a lot of witnesses, and it was not able to calculate how much interesting he was not in his book.
Furthermore, his "error" from the largest part he made in the two other books: Universal Structure and Hidden Reality.
Of course, neither author would find anything against if his book had been able to hold faster, but it is, even after 15 years, the Elegant universe provides almost all the subjects that would be informed by the ambitional understanding of the world had to know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is likely that in the next years, it will only be more than something in this area (the LHC accelerator will finally go to the "full floor") and so it is a good moment to go to Green unfortunately opened doors of modern physics.
How many measures can we have our universe?
It happens that our universe may have more than three space sizes, of course it can feel pockets, fantastic, amazing or mystical.
However, it's specific and very acceptable.
To understand that, let's turn our face from the universe as a whole to something amazing, particularly to a long and dark garden for the treatment.
Imagine that you take a 100 meters of the garden train from one side of the canyon on the other side and the whole scenario you look at half-km distance (as on the image and on the next page).
From such distances, you will easily indicate the length in the water-equality direction, but if you don't just disturb the smoothness, you'll get a deep rate.
In view of your big distance from the hadice, you would think that the marvine injured to live on the ship has only one size in which it can go: the left-right size of the hadice.
When somebody asks you where he was a murderer in the given moment, answer him only one of the information: the distance of the smoking from the left (or the right) end of the hadice.
That's all we want to say just that from half-climeter distance, it looks like a long hexadecist as a single middle object.
In the real world, he has a deep hadice.
If we grow up all, we'll see the second size - in the face of the corner lighting balls.
In such a great view, it is obvious that the smoking can be moved in two independent dimensions: in a well known left-right size after the length of the rate, but also in the "move in/to the movement of the horizon hand", so around the curve rate.
You're starting to understand that to determine the position of a small smoke, you must specify two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hadice and where it is on the corner of the smoke.
This reflects the fact that the ground of the rate is double-dimensional (e.g. experts describe that this chapter is focused purely on the struggle theory.
Initial aspects shall be fulfilled in chapters 12 and 13.).
The ground of the rate is double-dimensional: one long-term dimension is considered directly the pitch, the dimension in the direction of the rolling direction, marked by the row, is short and switched.
In the middle of these two sizes, it's not clearly clear.
The size of the rate is long and easily visible.
The size of the open railway of the hadice is short, "swind" and very known.
To make sure the existence of the crowd size, we had to examine the guard with explicitly better solution.
It is mentioned for example to illustrate the significant property of space sizes.
It's that they're divided into two groups.
They may be big, broken, and therefore directly, or even small, honourable, and much more observable.
Of course, in that case, we didn't just suggest that we're going to get a "swinutou" dimension that opens a deep hadice.
It's enough to take a lot of look.
But if the hadice was a thief - as a hair or capillar, we'd just cut off the dimensions with a lot of courage.
Caluza sent his article in 1919 to Einstein, in which he expressed a great thought that the space geometry of the universe could have more than three of us.
Caluza’s radically raised the reason that the additional dimension provides an elegant and perspicious frame, in which Einstein's general relationship and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be carried into the only, joined structures.
The question is immediately questioning how this chair of Kaluz is agreed together with a clear fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza had suggested between lines and clearly expressed and declared the Swedish Mathematics Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the statement that the space geometry of our universe can have as large, as well as low.
This means that the same size in the direction of the length of the hadice has also our universe large, broken and lightly visible three dimenses, which we have each time.
But analogically with the root range of garden hadices can have universe and additional dimensions, extremely convinced to the space so unlikely that the hiddens remained and before our best experimental cameras.
In order to get a clearer presentation on the basis of Caluz’s attention proposal, let's stay a minute at the hadice.
Imagine that we're drawing a black color at the front of the cycle.
The shadow looks like the hexadees still like a single unidimensional line.
With a distance now, we're going to decline the switch dimension still, we'll see the motive of the image 2.
Of course we see that the top of the hadice is double-dimensional, with one large and almost unlimited, and with the second short and crowd.
Caluza and Klein came with the thought that our universe has a similar structure, but except one small crowd dimension has three large spaces, then four percentage dimensions.
It's hard to draw object with too many sizes.
In order to help our presence a little, let's see the illustration of the subparagraph.3; shows two large dimensions and one small corner size.
On the image we increase the view of the geometry of space as we increased the rate level.
Each following level represents a large extent of the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of increase), if they are a lot of small space; so let's explain that we have not yet observed them.
The fourth network is usually known "grande" size, while the corner of the new, small and swintable dimension.
Just as a smoking smoke in a huge cut, and these circles exist in every place of normal sizes - we only have raised them because of the views only in the travellers in the fourth networks.
The Background of the image 4 is usually known a structure of space - a common world around us - in such common measures, such as metres, designed by a small quarter side in fourth networks.
On each next image, we are measured to the small area of the previous image; we increase it to be visible.
The beginning is nothing special, as we see at some of the first levels of increase.
However, when we put our way to the microscope properties of the space-- at the fourth level of increase in the image 3-- we will see this new, in the face of the mixed dimension, like a smile in a huge cup of the copper.
Caluza and Klein came with the thought that the additional root size exists in each place in the direction of large dimensions similar to the same as the hadice of the radiation in each point of its length.
In interest, we have drawn the root size only in some, regularly mixed points.
Image 4 of Kaluzo and Kleino's representation of microscopic structures of the space geometry.
The comparison with the murder is seen, we must also notify important differences.
First, the universe has three large, lower space sizes (of which we have drawn only two), where the hadice has a large size only one.
The more important differences of technology is that we are now talking about the space geometry of the universe alone, not only of any object inside the universe, we need our guards.
The basic thought is the same.
If the additional row is extremely mixed, recognize it is - as the root rate rate - much more difficult than observing the clear, large and wide dimensions.
If the additional size is sufficiently small, it will be deleted in reality and on the powers of our most moderate tools to increase.
The most important, but the additional dimension is not only a cloud ring within regular sizes, as a double-dimension illustration is wrong.
The cross dimension is a new size that exists in each point of three normal dimensions.
It is the size of the remaining three dimensions independently as the sizes of shoro-dols, the left-to-right and the Backward independent (a third) each other.
A small smoking could be moved in all four dimensions and, on the definition of its position, we would need four data, except three normal positions in the corner size; if we count the time, then five data, in every case more than we were expected normally.
Have you been busy?
The elegant universe of Brian Greeen can buy here on books.idnes.cz.
The e-book price is 149.
So, to our surprise, we are surprised that if we know that there are only three space sizes, Caluzow and Klein's consideration that there is not excluded the existence of additional significant dimensions if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions than how much we can see with the only eye.
How little should they be?
The most modernest technical packaging can recognize the structures of a large billion meter.
We can watch the smaller smooth dimensity of the soft.
In 1926, Klein original Kaluz's idea was combined with several thoughts from the born quantity mechanics.
His calculations stated that the additional crowd size could have the size of nearly one of the Length of the Planck, so far for the distinctive capacity of today's devices.
Since that time, physicals are called the possibility of additional detailed spaces of Kaluzo-Kleino theory.
Working Honza Homola advises how to move on the electric cytar: Part 5
The whole base of "12" is compatible with the twelve harmonic form that you can freely repeat.
Whoever puts in music theory will find her principle detailed here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
The training of the shipping and the shipping driver whose facebook profile can be monitored here is from maturity 20 years ago living as a graph.
It's a cytarist capel Wohnout, from which the crazy can't go away.
Kitaristo is after his father, like the brother Matthew, leader of Wohnuts.
Start on one side with training.
"Rytmical model is only on you, you can imagine anything, then it's enough to apply it to the harmonic 12 model," advised Honza.
If you add another stream, you can change the shape again.
It's enough to listen to Honzu, what's going to think about twelve sides and how good it's beginning to see.
If you get the third street, you can cook with melody some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, watching the change of training, Honza warns the video.
The next Honza returns to the pentanic and you're trying to get it together just with the twelve.
So get her honourable.
As best, you can learn in conversation with Jane Homola at the first lecture of his school games on the electric cytar here.
Next hair without waiting?
It's not for a great celebration, it recognizes the Great Square.
We're gonna buy it, and we'll like him.
The first half time, we had more chances, the second home," said the fugitive, who caught this time from the coffee.
Didn't you have been nervous when he played, but you just made him a terrible pick up?
Something particularly I didn't see it, even on the other gate where home fans are, it might be worse.
You've made a penalty half-hour, but you're also the hair of the penalty already getting up for four minutes.
What's going on?
We slept the beginning, we were passitive, he got out of the roof, and then the penalty after him.
After her, you took up and the first half time you were the best team that had more chances.
Why has this changed after a break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we've played the insected part until we're over there.
We said in the cabin we wanted to keep the time for the game, but we didn't.
To tell the truth, and I can't explain why.
But it's probably true that the households who stopped said something to their game, probably haven't been a lot of relationship with her.
You first pointed on the supply, while you haven't yet got a hair.
Why is that a difference?
I wouldn't say that it's such a difference, likely it's interesting on us how we're going to do it.
We started well in Brna, but then it was bad from us, Plzeni, that's another category.
You were waiting for four balls, don't you fear that it could be like after the last shot?
It's probably not, but we're sure that we don't need a word to listen to the hair.
Now, we have added more, but there are still three in six chambers, which still is not for a great celebration.
Island - the lake is attached from kilometers of a remote curve.
League flying on the plane in Holuhraun area is not far from Vatnajökull, a subterrane tonnel from kilometers of a remote curve.
This is under the ledge, the same part of the underground branch tunnel.
This reality now, the scientist is worried about the most...
The situation remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8)
2014) He still runs out of the pool of the same quantity of the leprosy.
However, contrary to the original disagreements is less than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
In contrast the previous explosion of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x.
However, scientists are afraid that the tune can open the lake tone can also in the places where it is under the ice.
If it happens, in addition with the same intensity, as the current eruption, it would be significant of a large rate, and as on the River Jüulsah and Fjöllum, as well as on other rivers.
In the surface of the surface, it's to feel strong towers, from the skins the clouds of the parks and the flowers.
It is, in the case of the erub of the tourist movement, in the case of the eruption in Fimmvörüls in 2010.
This is a lot of bigger, and there's also a lot of more flowers," says Armann Heskuldsson.
However, the time was significantly improved since yesterday, and in the morning hours there was nearly unbelievers.
The smokes after the songs were smooth with the rain.
Scientifics can continue in their work.
For aeroplane, the orange level (the second highest) is paid for Barbariarbung and yellow (third) for Asia.
The sky on Cheb looked like the worthy Lady Peggy.
She's gone after the shoes.
Aeroplane in Chebu.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 machine, a aircraft Peggy Walentin, who went out from the cockpit to the top duplexer and also between the crystal.
There's only been rejected on the power of the ships.
The aeroplane day in Chebu has already been channeled and the officers have made it again to prepare several interesting aircrafts.
The Premier at the oldest Czech Airport was not only "the ship after the shoes" in the introduction of the German Acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary shooting P-51 D Mustang or the airport Beechcraft 18.
The one shot the attention of his secret threat.
Acrobaty called Wingwalking has the origin in the United States.
After the 1st World War, many old military pilots were so trying to run.
Only because of the great number of deaths was denied.
But today, I'll get back to the plan of aeroplane.
Peggy after the start will go out of the cockpit to the top.
There's a variety of skins.
To the end of the outcome, it moves to the space between the aircrafts where its show continues," described Ludzik Mathiéčk from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the aircraft organizator.
Pilot flying Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy was the main sepulchre of the program, then the next presentation of Mustang's shopping was a public puzzle on the bottom.
The Legislator's board took the Grippey Army of the Czech Republic (including numbers).
This construction could first see the aeroplanes in Czech.
Pilot Miroslav Sasavski, however, brought all of them abroad with aeroplane from 1945.
He was yet made for war, but he probably never participated with her.
He was held in army reserves.
Since 1963, he worked in the citizenship.
It's like a travel air.
Today, he has his home hangar at the airport in Mnich Hardist.
In the same place, there are also another perl of the Cheb airport day, a two-motor Beechcraft C45H Expertor.
It wasn't possible to look at the aircraft.
He's rolled up the pitch in the ground.
Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in French aircraft colors.
Small transport airport was struck for the Turbolet declared and from German Hofu took part of German delegation on aeroplane day.
German neighbors in Chebu have been introduced with rebuilt airports like 18T or three-third forming duplexer Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return from the camera!
The parents' care has changed Lucie Borhy at least for tonight for the work.
Stress or nervous - a blonde moderator doesn't know anything of that.
The moderation of television reports was so good as it wouldn't have gone with him for two months!
It's now two weeks, that the blondes ended six-year-year-old, in which women's leaving the greatest stress.
However, Lucie will not still show regularly in the main reporting session TV New.
Regular return is waiting for her according to the Blesk.c information for month.
She's only her daughter, Linda, now needs more than TV divisions.
Lucie Borhy's returned to the TV screen and it was in black.
Exhibition for a year in Prace?
He'll be sold, planned by Jagr
It would be perfect if something like this would be done during the mystery of the world.
But it's important to set the shirt," he said in Jihlava after exhibition with the name of the gold excuse, in which the Nagan team was reached again.
And the players who shared in the gold sheet.
The players would have a lot, right?
Sure.
It would be quite good to make a divorce with a gold generation during mystery.
According to me, they're going to find a couple of days when it's full of freedom and where there would be such an excuse.
We'll tell Gumo (Jeremy Schlegro) or Bedi Scherban, who would take care of...
Arena would sell her.
What if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So when I'm coming so...
Play in representative, but you don't want.
Or has any changed your decision?
Representation and exhibition are two different things and in representatives are decision-making.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the conclusions are decided, especially the mystery of the world.
They should lead to players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually use this nagan search?
It was just a player's meeting was great.
Man survived his story and took a lot of games.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us.
Of course, Ivan Hlink's price was the most important.
And it's good to remind the story of our hook and that it's a generation that really stands for it.
Slavomore Lener, Vladimir Russell and Peter Chechmanic on the officer.
Do you still save your first representative box?
It's not forgotten for such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Hollikk and Robert Reichel, we got in one third.
For all this was the first representation start.
Well, but if we're doing some way, it's not possible to say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hashek got a long time.
What did you say about his execution?
My Hashan will never be surprised.
I wanted to return to him with this critical, but I can't (Hashek criticised Jugra for reasons why he decided to end in the representation).
And the fucking guy's done greatly.
Then he was with me once in the night, and there was a damn thing.
And now he's got a famous.
First of the United States and then the Netherlands, photobasts start quality
The NH Hotel was in the afternoon matching prominent hostels.
People could destroy Peter Cheche from Chelsea, the representative trainer of Paul Vrbu...
And there, the place in the black shirt, it's Tomas Rosical!
The officer Arsenal and the Captain of the representative has achieved about half of the twelve recent.
He's waiting for us a beautiful stress against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he had already come in the representative concurrency before the newspaper.
Czech representation programme
Section 1 of September: First training
Attorney 2 September: Trenink open for fanucas (18:30, Level) Autogram (20:00)
Mediterranean 3 September - United States (20:15, Level)
Friday 9 September - Netherlands (20:45, Late) end of the complaint
Russian and society can still support fanoises before the average storage against the United States (20:15).
The representation for them opened a foreign training beginning at League at 18:30.
And after him he'll follow the autography that Russian or Chech will not be mistaken.
Yet, this conference of the national team will be more quiet.
It's well-building the Vrba trainer, who's just on a number of society actions on the ground.
Finally, we're going to celebrate what we want to celebrate.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's amazing when you have players together eight days.
We'll have time to build things on which it wasn't so much time," he blessed Vrba, who officially leads the national team from January.
The Czech photoball representation will be carried out by entering a new qualification cycle.
Representation is under the Flower for three packs, all ready.
With Norskm and Finskem restricted 2:2 and with Rakoukem played 1:2.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's right now.
In the case of the Netherlands, the qualification of the progress on the European Mistery of 2016.
Of course, the Czech Management would be helped if he could also control the general against the United States.
The first half was to meet us.
Now there are important results.
We have to think about that to be successful," agreed Vrba.
The only player who has health problems is David Lafata.
He's threatening him.
If he couldn't be healed in a central excuse against the United States, the Vrba trainer would call another aircraft.
Genetic disorders are often diagnology
The woman from the British describes how she thought she died after a bad diagnosis of many years.
After diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers took the majority of the experience in the opinion that she remains only a few years of life.
In fact, Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrom (CMT) was a group of heritage struggles that smoke nerves outside the brain and the pig.
The CMT UK charitical organization pointed out that the bad diagnosis is a regular problem between people with CMT, because he knows just a little bit about the disease.
It is concerned that CMT in the United Kingdom suffers about 23,000 people, which can show symptoms in the field of motors such as svalbness, disease steal, and smoothed pieces on the feet.
In the posted cases, this status is increasing and progressive, which means that by the time procedure with symptoms is reduced.
When Rodgers was thirty, she thought that he suffered the fredrich atacs (FA) - a disease that has a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated the eighth birthday, she'd be thirty and died before she'd be thirty.
The mother of two children now is 51 said: “I knew that I couldn’t do the same thing as others.
I fell every day, and everything was long for me.
I never had to go with other children to cooking brushes or scateboards, and in school I was scanning because I was walking and running."
When Rodgers was thirty and was after several operations that had to leave her Ahillov's traveling and equipped the passenger, she used her doctor to leave the room, and looked at her documentation where she learned that she suffered FA.
“ I felt a criminal because I was watching, and so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I was looking for information about the disease in the book and wrote to the Association FA, ” says.
When they replied, I was in the shock, I just disappeared.
I thought before I was eight, I'd finish on the car, and before I've got fifty, I'll be dead, and I'll lose all my ability.
I was totally alone, and I planned to be a tomb."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her capacity wasn't disappointed as much as she thought, and she asked her chirurg.
He just stood, touched her, and said: “My beloved, I don’t think you have a disease, otherwise you would have been on the car.
I think it's gonna be a lot of less dangerous life."
After solving a number of genetic tests, he found that he had CMT.
“ When he explained what CMT is, I thought I was a child happy, ” she told.
The CMT UK charitical organization started a month of information about CMT to warn this disease.
Officers in Washington: Economic reserve shall be carried out
The growth economy means more customers, higher selling and new workplaces.
And also higher.
According to the new investigation, published last week, State and local exploitation of fire in the country with the rapidness of the economy health in the past year, and the company in Washington did not be excluded.
The businessmen in Maryland and Virginia were together for the fishing year 2013 to the State and Local Resources brought 27,6 billion dollars, which is more than 3,8 % of $26,6 billion of dollars selected in 2012.
The tax rate - State and local - has been carried about 4,3% to 671 billion dollars in comparison with 3,9% last year and the third growth year after the year 2009 and 2010, when the data was reduced.
According to the study of the professional company Ernst & Young and the Political Buy Center on State Taxation, the State data increased faster than 4,3% than local transports, about 3,9%.
More than half of payments, 56% is from animal damage, and 36% of Maryland's advantages are from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows at least less payments from the business.
Researchers say that the majority of the growth of payments is increased by the value of the potential of companies, which has been granted from the difficulty of this year after three years of growth -1 % increased to 3,7 %.
Although most of the ships come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is also in Washington.
The Communitys in D.C., Maryland and Vriginii have paid over 10 billion dollars in the state and local data of disease, which in comparison with 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual growth of 4,2 %.
However, the greater increase of potential values is not so much to exceed State and local payments in Maryland, where the poverty of disability represents an increasing five of the company.
For the companies in Virginia and D.C., it provides a debt of dignity at least half of the State and local opinion.
“In Maryland is a very much potential in the company, especially the basis of the data in the area of D.C., government or non-eductive organization,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is increasingly much more to pay to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase of payments from the business cannot be added only to the health market with disabilities.
According to the data, we also seem to have received from the business.
The companies in this region published $2,3 billion of the commercial companys that increased 2,1 billion from 2012.
Maryland's data from the trade companies has chosen one billion dollars, most in the region.
Although they are in the same direction, local charges of businessers do not grow in these three areas as fast as soon as soon as soon as soon as they are.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the entire average level, at 4,3%, while Maryland growth was very higher, 4,9%.
Only in Virginia was increased under average, at 4,1 %.
Virginia has the least consideration of the enterprises of the trade companies, 6 %.
The estimation of trade companys in Maryland is 8.25%, while average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9.975 %.
The similar study that this year has carried out the American trade community showed that Virginia has lower state and local impressions and totally more positive money climates than Maryland.
D.C. studies were not assessed.
And through this exhibition, Virginia's pressure of concurrence from the south.
North Carolina has signed the law that reduces the price of trade companies from 6,9% to 6%, as Virginia, and the next year is reduced to 5 %.
In the case of further fulfillment of the targets in the past year, the legislation provided for in 2017 may be reduced to 3 %.
According to recent studys with small businessers in Washington, it is better, and it is therefore paid to higher State and local payments.
Detailed contributions were detailed as a contribution of personal benefits - the structural compensation of the increased price costs, as well as the majority of the fires in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased in 20 % to 2,4 billion dollars in the past year, more rapider than other data.
The investigators say that the trends and the global increase of food data will possibly continue, the total payments from the sales for State and local governments are higher than 6,2 % in comparison with the same period in the last year of the first three quarter of 2014.
However, Washington can stay for others because the reduction of State expenditure is choosed by its payment on the work market.

Joan Rivers's family: "We're drying the balls"
Joan Rivers is in an unknown three days, since they brought her to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter today stated that she was not lost hope that she was a 18-year-old comic book.
“ Thank you for your welcome and support,” said Melissa Rivers today.
Let's keep her hands.
Her mother brought them to Mount Sinai Hospital on Friday after the telephone on the safe service, which has come to the heart-based endossy in the Upper East Side, as he introduced the source.
The doctors keep it urgently under the influence of the seditive and under the appropriate control until they are sure of its state that remains “wrightly. ”
Reactions were not allowed to wait for a long time, including unexpected support on the Internet from personality such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is interrupted titles
That the media covers reality, it is not a new news.
I know the titles of "produce" news, but I also know that they are many "learners" who do not read anything else.
And that's the fact that the last time I'm very threatened, most higher is the word of smoke.
This is particularly the articles about the conflict of Israel and Hammas in Gaza's field.
It's totally common to the title "Israel hit Gaza."
Before in the text, let's read that the Israeli "utk" was a reaction on the broken rackets of Gaza, and that's sometimes during the time of the explanation.
Then it appears to be the title "The two sides have been moved."
Does the newspaper recognize that this procedure belongs directly to anti-semit positions that grow throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even sixty years since the end of the second world war.
They live here people who survived Shaw.
When I saw videos from the German Republic of Germany, where Dave called the password "the Jewish Sweene" and the similar convincement, I was threatened.
That's what the world doesn't happen to Hitler?
Do our newspapers know that after the Jews they were determined to liquidate?
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome more jobs.
You are often marked as a "democratic dog."
So keep it off.
Before he's here.
Also, protect the right of the only democratic State on the nearest east to protect your citizens.
How would you want to keep our government, if some of our neighbors decided that the Czech Republic will cut out the map of the world?
Maybe you should also know another fact.
In the country of Israel, almost 20% of the Arabs with Israel's residence.
And they're good there.
If you ask them why they're not between them, they're not going to Gazy, they'll answer you why they're doing that?
In Israel, there are work, social security and health career (I saw myself on my own eyes, as to Hadassa's private hospital, which is financed from the sponsor gifts of the Jews from the whole world, usually walking in Arabians and there are understanding of the spectrum).
The hamage of his shoes will also shoot his Arab brethren.
The only real help of Gaz, and this unclean area, is to save Hammas and wear him.
And do not condemn Israel, that they should not be enemies in the titles.
Report the practices of Hamas, his disagreement of people as human ships.
Report that Hamas has to be a goal for Israel, and that is for any price.
And for the price of the death of the innocent Arabic children.
Please report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorism organizations.
Please note that for nine years the samoses in Gaze could be this area that increases the humanitarian assistance from the whole world.
Even from Israel, which adds water and electricity for which Gazy's manager does not pay, and even make sure they are often interrupted in this time.
If Hammas had not invested money to build under-term tunnels to achieve their own murderers in the field of Israel, but needed to build homes, hospitals and schools, he would live with his arabs brothers from Gaza.
Amazon buys for $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed information from the Sunday morning: Internet trainer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys $1,04 billion (970 million American dollars) video training service Twitch.
The announcement was called any surprise because nobody would expect to buy Twitch, but because it was expected to be a YouTube buying.
Three months ago he seemed to sell Twitche Google for a billion secure, and this connection seemed to be natural.
Twitch, who first founded Justin.tv before three years, had been able to become a totally used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead of this, it became a platform for players who sent online transfers from the Business Insider "YouTube for living overliving games".
Twitche interface.
On YouTube, there are already popular videos "Let's play", kind of where mudrlanti (the most old) gives the processing games of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube on the description of Twitch is coming to a lot of time, so the reports that YouTube buysTwitch, whose powers have not stopped, was an educational example of how the company led to pay a possible competition.
The consent is why the agreement with YouTube was not found, although the company was to pay the same cost as Amazon.
All we have in the present time is the statement of CEO Twitche Emmeta Sheara: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, he has the same values and long visibility and wants to help us fulfill it faster."
Another trial is - honestly - untrustable successs Twitch.
For dreams like me who say that sports are pleasant to do more than they see, it is hard to understand what is so wonderful for that, playing instead of the real game only to watch.
One thing is to be looking at three morning friends over the front of how Research Evil plays, and entirely another thing is to observe someone stranger, how to get twenty steps into the head in Call of Duty.
All games you could just look at.
Another problem is that many of today, most popular heroes are from the perspective of the player, so look at their record, and you can not control the perspective itself, is a very good recipe as to order the pain.
I admire that games of speed run in which Rogers Bannisters our electronic time ends the game in the record time is funny.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch will probably be very interesting.
But what about the skept like I know?
Twitch has 55 million visits monthly and is fourth on the top of the Internet.
How does Amazon use it exactly?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch enters into Amazon Instant Videos as elegant as it could be able to join YouTube.
But Twitch has something she wants to get every company: the mountains of young men who want inheritors.
As the director Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said "believers in the future of her" and the media seems not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Chess Translation of the American Atheist logers of Arona Ra.
This time on the subject "The Holy Scriptures are the word of God."
Original video added.
The second basic lie of creation is the faith that the holy texts have been seized by God and no true human authors.
When the believers debat one of the many things that are in contrast with their religion, they often set us before the question: Who will you believe?
A new word of God, or a word of a man?
Like if human investigation was totally invisible in comparison with the Authority which they imagine that he had their doctrine.
Only when they call a man, they're talking about science.
And when they refer to the "God's Word," they refer to the myths about the God of the anointed people.
If it actually exists intelligent with the Creator with some purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that separates the evolution history, and it must be the one who designed the genetic models that respond to it, and it must be he who adds further evidence that show exclusively to the evolution conclusion in the last detail.
Why would all of these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people have to tell the story, fabulous.
And they were people who wrote all the texts that suggest that they are God’s word.
Each holy teaching of any religion in the world describes himself as the seeds of men, nor of gods.
People who were "hindered" or "inspired" their favorite gods, or have had to hear the dick of the angels, but the texts were not sealed to any other than the only deaths with a certain way of presence, no angels and no gods.
If there was actually one real God, it would be a integral part of all gods of all religions, over-galatic supergenium, the ultimized entity of the whole cosm.
If the lives of such size sometimes write the book, there would be only one such book, the only holy letters.
She would be known all over the world, without predominants, parallel or alternative in any language, because only people cars could not meet this.
And people would not have to believe in her, because it would be consistent, based on confirmable and true evidence, and it would declare the deep dust and wisdom of all human limits.
It would continue to inspire each readers to a single faith.
If God writes it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
It's just what we're seeing instead of that, it's exactly a face.
Instead of the only religious leadership to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all are still disappeared on what more separated denomination, looking for sportive truths, and every way to reject God’s guidance, without regarding the continued disputation and separation in each direction.
Jewish Thora, Christian Evangelium, Islamic Koran, Baha'u'llahah of Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathushththro of Avesty, Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharatian Bhagavad-Gita, or the book of Urantia are all considered as "absolute truth" and "the only true God" and the consented faiths of each of them say that the rest are in the holiday.
The only logical explanation is likely that all are in a certain way.
No of the above mentioned books have any other events.
No one of them has evidence, and no one can confirm historicly.
I'm Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm an older teacher of the Old Michigan University.
I don’t say I have proved that the Bible is comfortable and historical.
Of course it's not.
You still have faith.
All of them require faith and apologies, because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive imaginations once considered the truths that have already been convinced.
So you can't tell that they are exactly God's wisdom.
Many of them makes poor beliefs in place of disease, and many of them say that they were confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with that each can also contain prophecy that had not been fulfilled.
The previous teologists suggest that all the holy texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are the subject of interpretation, acceptance and views of their primary and often consented politically motivated authors, which explain many contradicts and inequalities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contrary, like one of the other comments.
We have to show it again that we have two different authors here, which work was sometimes broken together during a review of the editor.
He has the truth that Genesis has more than one author and doesn't have the statement of a clear witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, including the five books of the Mosaic and Moses do not write the authority of no one of them, because he has not already existed as it is written in the Bible.
The experts agree that Genesis was established (probably Esdras) of several non-accepted training traditions before less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were carried out at the same time, and all were submitted to human authors.
The Bible is not even as old as her faithful.
The swifts from the Dead Sea are the oldest archeological findings of texts known for their unfinished base of all western monothetic faiths, but in many centurys they are younger than the root of the chooseastrian, buddhism, the Indian, the Helenism, the rural cultures, the Chinese or the Egyptian religion.
The Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed the doctrine and the emotional and their full - entire views of Jesus, which finally were combined in any compromise called ortodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luphyrians were divorced and discussed by other Bible reviews.
One of these amendments is related to King Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers made a fundamental threat for young Muslim religion, the authors of the New Law decided to be confused and Ba'al Zebul, "Man on the mountain" changed in Belzebub "Man much."
So the Bible was strictly changed as religious, as well as political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened by the New Law was convinced in the series of Commission decisions on sleep in Nicaia in the 4th century.
Four Evangeliums were accepted and sixty others were rejected by simply carrying the hands, as if the reality of some things had been accepted or refused to vote.
The procedure that the Canon had been developed wasting on the reading of the weeks in the Christian centres.
What was reading on the second week after the biggents in the church?
And what in the Roman church in the same time?
And immediately they discovered that he was close to the same evangelism story.
So the canon nuclear was thus developed from the first church.
So the council just accepted as an Evangelium any relevant story that had collected between the unseen mass in that time.
However, they did not know how much more than ten books from the Bible, even when they refer to them the books that were approved.
We will find writings as apostles, as the prophets.
Why should God’s word be told us to books that are only words of some people or/or are not yet available?
Who was here a real editor?
The Bible often reduces human authors.
But how could it be approved if God would be the true author of this famous story, parable and psalmist lyrics?
The Bible was sure that it was written to people, and it was not too lighting, of course!
That's why it's such a large part of her content historyally and scientificly completed to the end, that it's at least anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that the balls and the oxen can speak, believe in the cluster, blood sacrifices, ritual cups, covered targets, fire medicines, astrology and five lives of magic.
They thought that when they used the cockpit that somebody shoot blood, he'll treat it out of the best.
We're talking about people who thought the kings are survivors and non-profits are birds and fishes are fish and drink that they are all numbers.
These people believed that when they showed the weight of the weight of cutting models, they're going to be raised.
How could someone say this, who knows something about genetic?
Of course, the authors didn't know that.
If the Bible had been published a larger residence, then it would not contain such mistakes.
If she had gone from the money really override and had been considered as a perfect story, then she would not contain anything of what he contains.
As a moral leader is entirely missing because, most of the original Hebrew Scriptures have been raised by unseen and bigoting divorces, which have seen or supported the cross of the animals, incentive, slavery, consumption of slaves, destruction of slaves, children's use, violence on children, suffering, killing, canonizm, genocide and precepts in the race, nation, religion, sexual orientation.
To make their neighborhood in the meaning that they do God’s will.
However, creationists still ignore all these things.
Some of their websites suggest that if any reality is in comparison with the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists don't have their loved books, they would have no god.
They have one and one another in their world.
It's ironical that God's "party" refuses to be worshipped instead of the Creator.
But they themselves think the word of humans for the word of God and the God of selfish, and even that the exemption of their "holy" book will bring forth a god as such.
Neither of their gods, but all the versions of God.
Creationists think that if the Bible is wrong, God lying.
They can’t accept that God could exist and the Bible could be in the present because he can’t separate the doctrine from God.
So it is about the kind of idolarity where faithful worships a man produced compilation, as if these books were the only God, because they think that they are the words of Jehovah.
God never wrote any of the letters of any religion.
All that people have approved or refused to their given "unnamed word" any god had been considered, constructed, constructed, translated, interpreted, modified and often changed and interrupted by only errors.

Apple iCloud fully submitted the hackers, publicly received the pictures of the celebrit
Screenshot with single files
The anonymous user on the server 4can publishs the nave and pornographic images of American celebrit, warned this US server Mashable.com.
It has obtained an invalid access to the user accounts on Applu servers where users have been carried out by automatically loading images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple wasn't going to get a problem yet.
The part of ceremory rejects pictures as failure, but there are already some of the rights of the images.
It is a heritage of Jennifer Lawrence known from the title role of Katniss in the film series of Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which played for example in Smrtonos Paste 4.0.
The purpose of the hacker is to use obtained images and videos to protect.
The reports on the 4chan server reported, but the hacker wants more money from the community.
According to the Server The Next Web is very probably about the slabin in the iCloud security.
The GitHub server found a tool before two days ago, which allowed the password to receive user accounts through several powers, so automatically re-repeating tests of login with various passwords.
This tool worked properly, but Apple closed two days after the security room.
However, the potential attorneys had a lot of time to get access to various accounts before the publication of this tool.
The iCloud users should thus change their password associated with Apple ID.
The important is, therefore, the length of the password, not its entirety.
The appropriate length is at least 12 characters.
The employment of the images of the objectives shall be considered as a reminder of safe use on-line services.
Although the fire servers, such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, are safely safe than computers in homes or small companies, are uploading citizen photos in an unsaved form of risk.
If you want to close an explicit photo or any other citizen content, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also understanding to configure the automatic recording of photos from the phone so that it is only on Wi-Fi and after connecting to the driver.
So you'll have the opportunity to move "to safe" during the time of citizen images, and mainly you'll have a space to remove the unreasoned images, so they will not kill enough space in online.
In order to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers as an electronic book from Michal Altaira Valaska in PDF format.

Bahno, the same manner.
And then they found in the fountain of the puzzle of the war.
This stuff stands a rock from the Sv. Jir.
We discovered the ship around and started to use an aircraft, a meter and a half of the bar and a smooth list.
When we were closed to the egg day, we've cut off the head," Radomil Newak.
We took her out, cleaned her, and found that it's a crazy German puzzle that they used the SS units.
Nalaz is very innormal.
According to my information, such puzzles were produced until the end of the war.
And they were about three hundred thousand," he added News.
All tree constructive things have been scheduled with time, so it is not useful.
Her body is, however, keeps his face.
How's the ocean in the bowl?
One explanation exists.
Maybe people who needed to save the weapons used by the SS units could probably be scared of fear that they should not be removed.
The fascists wouldn't have done it.
They dropped the weapons in the woods, "I think the neighbor.
The puzzle was the only thing that the surprises found in the bowl.
"It could be the hands of the grenates, those who were around a lot, so we lost the shopping work, so we were able to shoot the barney that it would not happen, but nothing else wasn't beyond there," came near the New York.
Naalez is finished in the museum depositary on the cluster in the recent Sleez Rudolcians.
Ukrainian General: I haven't freed the prisoner of the Czech
Excluding conversation currently.That's with the general philosophic Volodymy Ruban, which frees Ukrainian soldiers from capture of prorue separats.
Kyjev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donyck," he even apologized eight times in the exclusive conversation with currently.
Generator Volodymyr Ruban in TV debt.
In each such a interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or they should be - that Ruban raises his tracking on the second end of the phone.
"It's gonna be - go there," concluded one of the blue discussions with Donec and reached that one of ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the office, sometimes a shipping pilot and an active participant of the anti-governmental protests on Maydan.
Yesterday, when we were talking about, he was in Donec.
The freedom of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of proru separats is held forty-four hours day.
Currently.ch: Perhaps you know that the proruent separators are fighting on the side of Czech.
Our contradiction declines their number to 30.
It may be more than they.
Have you already met a cheese prisoner at your officers?
Volodymy Ruban: I've released the officers of Serby, Dagestán, Chechence, one Sweden, Gross... but Czech is still not.
But I know who to turn back to Prash if we'd cut on your prison country and could save him.
Ukrainian soldier occupied separates
And: What do you like to Czech who are added to the proruists and the Ukraine's soldiers?
They should understand that if such as the Chess fights in the Ukrainian negotiations and separately are taken, they are after hearing without mercy, as well as any other alien.
Separatists think of these men as a pregnant soldier, and they don't serve anything else than death.
But if the Ukraine soldiers, for example, take a group of individual separates - and then there is a need for them and the Checha -- they will sit in the middle and act with him as a war prisoner.
That guy's alive.
The Ukrainian side keeps the war as a state.
And how many have you already been able to save Ukraine's prisoners?
If I understand it well, they'll change it.
Some resources say that it has already been over hundred men.
We've stopped counting a long time. We've helped many people.
We just delivered them... we didn't save them before the war if they decided to continue wars.
The safeguards are in the war of doctors, chirurgs, but we're absolutely not.
That's it.
And every day they get another and another.
We'll save anyone every day.
Sometimes one, four or five.
And she doesn't always need to go to the change.
Sometimes it's enough to leave prisoners and make human demands.
A.cz: It's listening that you have received a few months in the proruists of the great authority and even confidence... as in the Ukrainian company.
How did you make respect to both war parties?
A serious question.
One of the officers in Kyyev gave me an overseer "the crazy general with the iceballs."
It doesn't make me it.
And maybe it increases the basis of our work.
As the chief of the Ukrainian Destination Congregation I have received a authority before.
I'm never cutting, I'm not leaving and keeping a word.
Whatever happens, I'll be honest and I'm talking to the truth.
Even when it's a Ukrainian government, or that domain or luhanian is very inadequate.
If they kill and kill people?
So I'm just telling them that they're smoking and killing them.
And they're crimes.
Sometimes I risk life, even when I'm in prisoners, and I'm taking this job for me whenever I'm going to sign the end... I don't have to go back.
And, do you know how many training and murdering of prisoners are?
... (length long) to murder the prisoners in the outcome, Ukraine and separate.
It's crazy.
What's the transport?
You're getting out on the other side.
I don't have any information about that the Ukraine Army also carries prisoners.
No signs of the Ukraine Army will be recommended by something similar.
We've got a presentation about the quantity of transport, but I can't tell the numbers and I don't want to.
A.ch: Describe me the characters and the motives of proruistic separates.
They're officers among them, but they're also a veteran from Afganistan.
They're trying to be selfish and maybe democracy in Donec or Luhansca -- they say at least.
They don't want to play more games with Ukraine Oligars.
Separatists have already plenty of oilgarches, and they are their unbelievable refugees - for life and death.
As we say, they've been eating them after a hungry.
The same dreams and dreams gave people to the outside and to Maydan.
And now I'm a little surprising: Russia supports separates and Western also the Ukrainian State.
I think one speculation is big, and the second is a little.
This is my fault, but it's hiding the uncomfortable divorce.
And, how do you have one of the most important leaders of Igor Bezler?
Always when I'm overwhelming the lines of war fronts, I'm without weapons and I'm shown to soldiers or weapons broken by hands.
And I always have both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters on the museum or in the optic officer.
The faces of people who are on me, I'm always seeing good... and they can shoot their weapons anyway.
Officer, a tested employee with German and Ukrainian fronts.
He is considering a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine shouldn't exist.
And if so, just like a small government in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, Ukraine continues to talk about it and considers how great incomprehensibility.
That state would not have existed by him.
Also, he is an incompatible enemy of all Ukrainian oligars.
A.cz: When we are already talking about characters - in the debate show of the Ukrainian TV, you are your president Arsenie Jaceňuka marked as a low, unbelievable, unbelievable "leader" who would do the best if he would go quickly.
Three hundred meters I'll always get to be at least five times scared.
So why should I be secreted with the opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak premisher and that our land is worse?
Is he part of you in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukraine Jaceniku's overseas the "King".
And the Queen is not in the eyes of the beasts who would go to fear or should be in other respects and authority.
His behavior copys the behavior of the Queen.
Maybe it's a good economy, but as the Premier doesn't have the right to weep in the war in the Parliament, ask him to play his intrices with him, to excuse that he's put the functions... he needs to lead the land, control it, and to protect it during the war.
At the front of the land there is no precursor for family, friends, rest of the breathing emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine Ministers.
And Jaceniuk?
She's like a pubert girl.
Yeah, he's soon, but he's too weak, because he's never strong... he's afraid of Ukrainian, he's just on the end of everything.
That's why he should go.
What before, it's better for Ukraine.

Film festival otherwise survives crisis
After a large overseer over the Birdman's story film, whose register Alejandro González Ingárrite was in the frame between the serious candidates on the gold lion, there were more days shown that the interest of the 71th year's festival in Benatas had somewhere.
That is because the number of places in the largest salary increased for fourteen hundred, or because after Birdman followed the criteria recognised, but for the wonders less adjusted pictures as a document on genocide in Indonesia 60 years, see silence and other films with social issues from the 99 houses after the Iran Revelation, in Chinese there was an empty seat.
Hrdines of comics
Even the red cobbert before the festival path was still not obtained such data as in the past and stopped to be a problem to be raised at the last moment in the hotel.
The crisis in Italy speaks more than anywhere, and it's not amazing that it's like Bethel and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not demonstrate the loss of personality, but the future is explicitly in relation to films.
While younger fanois were used by cargrams of comic superheroes Michael Shannona and Andrewa Garfield, who had successfully achieved dramatic roles, for all generations without difference became the main event of the visit of the leader's hero Ala Pacina.
He closed this more in two films.
In the history of the Research of the conspiracy that touched the Oscar Bar Levison according to the Rome of Philip Rotha, a Fourty-five-year-year-old Pacific role, which is close to him: the herd on the top of the glory that suffers depressions with the end of carrier and personal life.
But to see him immediately the second day as a convinced soldier leader of the foreign city in the Manglehorn film, who touched David Gordon Green, was really an unforgettable experience.
Wouldn't he have to do it for the best hereafter, but he still needs price for the Pacific format?
Perhaps it's the greatest satisfaction of the public love, and the Italian speciality, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino's hungry is reported to the land from which his birthdays are coming.
Bodies for Italy
Lastly, it's just an Italian film leads to Benatac very well.
The black souls who replaced Francesco Munzi became the first image of Birdman's long-term steel.
The Calabrian reference is in it in view of family relations between clubs that fight together with the power and money, and the regimer made all the proposals for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and hero.
He also took the comor psychothriller Glad heart, who touched Saverio Costanzo with Albu Rohrwacher in the work of a woman who had a lot of distress to kill his own child.
In addition, from the French Countries films, it was not expected to be accepted of a green accommodation or purchased for honor, or 3 hearts, both works in the traditional model of console films that are concerned about the population of hereafter representatives.
But at the end, two really exciting films, so Birdman and Black soul are not at the first half of the festival.
And even the festival pictures have the world's depressive subjects, the new dream Peter Bogdanoviche with the name She's Funy That Way, a funny cody referred to in Benatkas outside the convention and in the style of American vestrooms 40 years old, he could invite a relief to more than one day.

The Dealer was a punished seven times since 1995
"On the available economies, then, the police detected that the main organizator was since 1995 seven times judged for a criminal act, the woman was not judged," complemented the police speaker.

His statutes and tasks in this case were not so fundamental as the other accused.
Policists with this man are still working.

“It's a limited space for opportunity, but the public mind must think that there is changes in the situation," advised.
Otherwise, the situation could be worse.
Hazard and a lot of science now Praha is not limited to the choice
The changes of the relevant statements should be prepared and approved until the new guide of the main city.
From the street of Praha will not be limited before community choices, and the city will not be limited to a lot of science.
It won't be limited to the dog's winning.
The price does not take place to prepare and apply in the procedure of changes of the relevant excuses.
"The amendment decision would also not have to do the current leadership of the city that ends for a few weeks," said the advice of Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past weeks, there were just a few ratings, for example, Prayers 5 and 7.
Herny, but it's not missing. The explanation of the ground will not change anymore.
It's a job for the new leadership of the city after choices.
Now we would not be technically able to take it in consideration, for example, the periods for the introduction of memories and the same way," explained Manhart.
It added that the last operation of the current procedure which must apply the amendment of the statement is approved on 11 September.
The Referendum on the Development Communities of Praha 1 and Praha 8.
In the present time, for example, in Prae 2 or Prace 12.
The explanation of the same reasons will not change nor in the case of a single art, such as a busking.
In particular, Praha 1, which has already sent the Government's proposal for locations that would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians don't want Praha 5 in the road of Angel.
Regular excuse of dogs in the city is a few months, yet not finished.
The location of heren and busking's problem is the city's explanation.
It can deliver or edit them only the main town's privacy.
The councils have just a counsel, they don't have a call.
Last week he set the victory to the Scope Independence for the duration of the hands
Scope independence campaign was in danger that this mistake makes the third mistake when he left the billboards on the whole Scotland question, whether Scotia wants to be rich.
Only to the heart of the Scope choices you will not be able to apply for their money, and you will not be respected when you start to assault them.
The Moral of New Law is still living in Scotland, even though a few Skotes are still going to the cook today.
Scoti have a lot of greater tendencies to exceed the changers from the temple than to detail them how to vote.
The boss of the Scotland Nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore, in the TV discussion, he asked again his support, the Unionist Darling, whether it is appropriate to respect the "Suverenian Work of the Scotland", if Skotland votes for independence, and started supporting a single change for Scotland and England.
It was Darling's needed to call between the Scotland Republic and the London Financials, and with the grimas fell into this past.
Of course, Darling doesn't support to send the Scotlands.
However, the discussion about what Scope will have to change has been more neutralised.
What really motivates the Scotland volators is fever, work opportunity and protection of the State Health, which are in harmony.
Darling supported the London banker in the ministry and also urged that he would not protest the health privacy.
As Salmond said, "He went into the bed with the concert."
This is a very dangerous position for each Scotland policy.
Each Scope pioneer knows that the Scope businessers are in bed with concerts.
This confirmed David Cameron, who spoke nothing to the callers in Scotland, but to associate "boss" to the Confederation of the British Industries.
It begins to be clear that Camerono refused to discuss the independence with the Scope Premier Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionistic campaign.
Cameron looks like a white absent home.
Scoti would respect him if he had come to the debate with the Scope Premier.
Cameron, at least, proved to say that Scozia could be a successful independent country.
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, he's at least a physical pain.
What he's doing is clear: they don't shoot, and they have to accept what is.
The greatest year has 10 months.
Psymistic start of school according to Miloche Urbana
Impression for the latest year
Miloš Urban Last year
The end was the best of the empty, the last week that we had already gone, and we just called to the baby a year, quiet before the battle, quiet before the stream.
New clothing when it was able to get out of Tuzex, Eastern Germany bottles.
The reading of the Quick Swaps, already amazing, smoking around the mountain around the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis corts, there was no longer a front, the sun was hungry and the branch, rolled the pattern on the bottom.
Tonight, there's still an empty mode, to sleep at half of the eleventh, for a week, a minute before hearing, they'll go out from a couple of minutes to two hours, and tomorrow to rise at half the seventh.
It's coming tomorrow.
Most of them, at least, the year's deceived in the front of school.
Attaching in a mirror light on the floor and looking like a plastic steel in the steel, there is the school, ZDSCH A.
A smoking with a low-round bottom, and before her old known faces, even a few news, kids higher, girls more plots.
There are grass, they're going out, they're also interesting how immediately they're taking the field and how they're here soon.
And these adults looking like the girls who came to cry out now with something of hisstericals, probably changed something in their life through the empty, while everything is at my old.
And again the new chiefs, some nervous and other pleasure, why do I beat here?
Because he needs a training military obligation.
So inside, the cold depth of the bottom and the easy pack of dezinfek, opened a high school with the mope, because he still was the same, that he was the same, the key of the ball box, where they are given to leave the teachers and who are still so little.
For a flash.
It's not done now, it's a good explanation, but in a week it's gonna be worse.
It's just from that presentation that's a light prisoner, and it's starting the head's pain.
The head that we're still learning from the mathematics, the devil game for the chosen, and I'm not looking at, and I will never be.
The three and four, the unbelievers of five, hiding themselves before trying, falling into the lavage and the best exemplary, be there, existing just as a name in the class, and dream historics about loved girls and beautiful buildings, about antennaries in the universe where no one is in the universe, no one puts up and doesn't touch any feet.
The greatest year has ten months.
And it's the first day, now like years ago.
The born daughter left death.
She's worried until a special challenge - News.cz
To the first proposal, in March 2012, the public toalette was achieved in Jihlava.
Without a strange help she was born a girl who was able to roll up in the preparated decades, she was driving under the town and brought her to the motor carrier where she put her into the rooms located with a few ten meters from the street.
Family Road to school
I think it came to me a little before.
I was on the way to school.

She's born, she's buying for me.
I stopped the legs I brought to school, and she described, and showed that she had been shooting for the disease.
"The next day she returned to the place, the child's body entered into the bathroom and took the body out of the bathroom, throwed into a black egg, and hid and left under the ground in her grandfather's house in Havlettech Brody," she stayed in the case that it was not very clear when she came to death.
It could be for ten minutes, but even a few hours after the ground, a depression when covering the deck or when entering under the bowl, subtracting or blowing out of the unrelated pump.
The normal scenario was repeated the next year on the ground.
A woman in the nearby unsearched time since February to April 12, when the child's dead was found with the proper witnesses under the fishing of the fishery at Havlycods, she again born secretly.
This time in a subcover apartment in a family house.
She didn't see if she was born alive, she stopped and put a puppet that was turned around the bridge, she put the child into some plastic balls including the eggs and left him in the cup.
Lastly, in the afternoon, they sent him to the fishermen together with the next partner.
Finally, he gave her a friend.
The father of both children was just a friend invited, but he didn't know exactly about partners.
For this reason, it was not now before the judge, but it was only punished for a transgressor against the law of enterprise.
It was also the one who turned back to the police later.
I don't like that he's not tortured as a partner.
He manipulated my friend with the child.
I know that my solution wasn't right, but it came to me in this moment as a human," she didn't hide the condemnation of the urgent, which was in the relationship with a man and feared him.
In the process of her explanation, the young woman talked directly.
The slide in her eye just when she talked about the relationship with the parents, from which she left herself after the fulfillment of herself.
She didn't want to kill
"They're following me every 14 days for a visit, they're doing everything entirely for me, even though I know I don't serve it."
I wasn't able to get a kid, because I didn't want children, I felt young.
Fort wanted to give him to the babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can't explain it to you," she answered the judge's question.
However, she refused to act with the thinking and the purpose of killing the new age.
The second child was born, even according to her suggestion, dead.
Not in the disease, but she didn't get drinking alcohol.
However, I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
And I've restricted the cooking," she took.
Although it was in both cases to see, all of them said that he had a healthy difficulty to be carried out.
And that's the friend.
The main treatment will continue in the Court of Justice in the explanation of courts.
In the middle, the judgment may be already issued.
The woman is threatened to 18 years of prison, in case of an exceptional crime.

Prodemokratic activities in Hong Kong on the day after the voting decision shall implement the Chinese authorities
She was nearly invited a group of people loyal to Beijing who had a Chinese football.
The Commission of the National Human Congress on the Wednesday approved that the elections were participated in Hong Kong only two of the three candidates in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support of the Commission on the name, which will probably be composed of the members of the faithful Beijing.
This Decision is at least impossible for the opposition democratic democracy to re-democratic activities and to renew the promise and to protect the Hong Kong's Financial Centre's Protection on the "Occupation Centre".
In Hong Kong, the political reform is the main cause of violation, the Chinese leaders fear that the requirements for democratization are extended to other cities.
After Beijing published in June the detailed report of the Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists ordered non-official reference to options in the special official office and hundreds of thousands of people entered into the city trade quarter and had located it.
The press conference in which the Premier Li arise, organizes the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Scientific Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, there were also a number of print conferences to speak to the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and the Chairman of the State Council for the Interest of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
Students have announced that they are gathered before the officers of Hong Kong.
In the past 150 years ago, the Colonial Government has never mentioned the Democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin requests Kyjev to begin with Eastern Ukraine on the “state suvereignty”
According to the description of the events of Russian newspapers, the Russian President Vladimir Putin requested the Ukraine Government to stop fighting separats on the east of the country and immediately started the action on the “state suvernity” of the departed areas.
His speaker Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had not to indicate that the East Ukraine areas under control of separates are part of Russia, but that their state in Ukraine should be determined that Russian speaker area has the right to protect their rights and interests.
Putin's calling of the Kyyavy Government to cooperate with the Prorusian Revolutions as equal to themselves, is responsible for the public strategy that is leading from the exposure of diseases before five months ago: Help separats to contain the country and give the Ukraine Government to make the new stated Novorus in fact unconscious to the west's location.
In the conversation for the first country channel, Putin rejected Ukrainian military actions to reach the Eastern regions of Donec and Luhansk, which in March and April controlled separately after Moscow 18 March actived the Crim's passenger in Ukraine.
Criml and separats recently contained fields were marked as “Novorusco” or“Novore Russia” as a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of Russian Empire.
The Russian print agent Itar-Tass published the words of Putino, according to which it is “the prison of Ilusia” every one who believes that it is peacekeeping, because the Ukrainian politicians have started before Parliament's elections 26 October, while the government units affect civil residence in the areas of control separates.
“In the interest of people who live in these areas, we must not just begin a comprehensive action and not only on legal matters but also on political organization and the State of South Ukraine’s State Sovereignty,” he reported.
Peskov said that Putinova was considered in the context of a larger autonome, with the leader of Kyjeva, a few months ago, and that has to reduce the fear of Russian speaking areas from the creation of cultural and language laws.
Peskov stated that the needed autonomy can only share the Ukraine Government in the east area.
Not on the matter of introduction between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “It is why the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal Ukrainian conflict."
The claim of the speaker Kremlu, which had been corrected by the “incorrect interpretation” notes of Putin's notes, has shown access to Russia to resolve the resurrection of separats on the east, which is distinct from the open containment of Krym, where most of the 2umilion population is the origin of the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have a greater difficulty to reject Donnyck and Luhansk in the east Ukraine, because most of 6,5 million people are not Russian and the public measures that have been achieved before conflict, have shown a wide support in Ukraine.
The autonomy on which Russian diplomats had acted on international forums to provide regional governments in Ukraine to determine their own trade agreements and international relations and, in particular, to give Kremla a real control on the country that would be associated with the Russian Federation with the Crime.
The Black Polar Action Actioned Five months ago is the main Russian Sea flow, the Sea Trade Flights and historical Northern Restaurants.
The clouds between Russian Rostove and Krym are also the central bottom, equipment and sleeves that produce significant components for Russian army.
The Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his inauguration state of 7 June, proposed Ukrainian lawyers - after new options - to assess the changes in the situation that would give various regions more controls on their financial and language state.
This vision of autonomy is, but significantly different from the vision of Kremlu and separats. Moscow is convinced by arming and improving violence.
The last call of Putin's call that Kyev had been separated as he had followed after the next procedure of the populations last week after that Russian units and tanks came out of the street of the Asian Sea on East Ukraine.
The Russian Separatists have carried out the control of the Novoazovs so that the Ukrainian Security Authorities are afraid that it is an objective to achieve strategic borders to Krym.
This has made a serious civil and military trial to build Mariupol, with metalurgic combined with 500 thousand citizens that are living between the Novoazovs and the strict entrance door at the Croatian Flood.
The Conference on the Sabbath meeting of Member States of the European Union in Brussels and chose to action that would prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Old Soviet Republic, which is independent in the past 23 years.
“We are close to the point which is not returned, ” warned Porošenko.
In Ukraine, there are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of stranger tanks.
The EU Summit has not submitted any definitive steps - the leaders call to take other sanctions against Russia in case of unspecified Ukraine crisis.
The chief Andri Lysenko, speaking Ukrainian National Security and Protection Council on the Sabbath Reporters in Kyev, said that the Ukraine soldiers had to get up from their positions in Ilovian after the last week two columns of Russian Royal Cars and 1 000 military units were going to Douane to support the low separates.
First of 63 Ukrainian soldiers who had been taken in the Russian Invasion were replaced for 10 Russian officers held a week ago in the Ukrainian country.

The photobalist Sigmy's got Leebra, and without exhibition
Olomouc - Chrome and blasque, whose columbian Sigmy Josef Leebr sent on his last week, they look like, old.
They'd just take a point from Opava's ultimately for a non-free restrictions.
The club boss was just a bit of a bit of a club boss.
The money for payment would be quickly coming to the club.
"I'm going to leave another shot as I spoke about this last week, but I'm a lot more optimist," confirmed Leebr, in particular that Sigma did not play, his player convinced with a better execution.
The battle and the assault we played mainly in the second half time was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In such case, I could apologize that she doesn't win.
If we were playing so from the beginning of the meeting, I'm surprised that we're still not played," thinks Leebr.
Sigma in Opava stopped the lead pressure of homes, then the game justified and in the second half was better.
After the victory of Calvod, the officers were gathered, but their possibilities did not get to the role, so they couldn't win.
The result is not according to our presentation.
To complete happiness, we were missing, but only one changed chance," he reported Lebr, but he doesn't think that the change in the access of footballists only made his exchange.
There was probably more aspects there.
Let's go from my side, from the trainer, or from the fans," said Lebr.
With a button, Sigma has to calculate
The players did not want to comment the event of the last week after the time in Opa.
I'm trying to get out of all these things.
I've tried to stop it," the young brancher Michal Reichl's head.
It was completely without comments, but he left a question on Lebrov's statement from the last week of Vaclav Vašičk, which has not changed the greatest opportunity of Sigmy in the Sunday Case.
But he's just talking about the button.
We'll always be under the press.
Everybody wants to get out of us.
Today we showed that when we're fighting and running everybody after the fuck, it's gonna happen."
Warnings were taken to the heart
Neither Leoš Kalvod struck that the preparation was not the most simple atmosphere in Olympic last week.
It was too hard.
But I think the boys knew it, and today was to see that the warning of Mr. Lebra took into the heart.
Even though it wasn't about that they wouldn't want to fight and break it down," he said the Olympic trainer.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It was so long before we were compared with the courage, and we knew what the second line was.
That's not just about photobality, but principally about that fight," says Calvod.
It's not enough to hope that Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd really like to believe it," added.
