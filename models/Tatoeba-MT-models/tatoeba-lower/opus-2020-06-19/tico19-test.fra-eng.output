How much do you feel of these symptoms?
and all the terroric pains must be treated in this way, in particular in your age
And especially if you have the feast
and your cholesterol and your tension must also be controlled
And do you have the feast now?
Are you feeling toocratic pains now?
Do you also have difficulties to breathe?
Can you tell me if you have other symptoms?
And how much have you got to feed?
and I'm all all right.
And I've got a little smoke, and I'm all right.
And I'm really very bad at the poetrine today
Does the current period be proper to your fuels?
And I have these pains in the poetrine.
And I think I've got a little fiber.
Can you indicate me where you feel the torahic pain?
And they have a little deceivement,
and with your diabetes ancients
And you know I've got the impression that my poetrine's going to override
And you know that people all over me.
and you have pain in the poetrine
and you said to feel a pressure in the poetrine
In cases of heart problems, heart pathology, heart crisis, high grade of cholesterol or arterial tension in the family?
Do you not remember other symptoms or problems in more muscular pains?
Is there other sick people in you with the same symptoms?
Do you have other symptoms?
Are you suffered?
Do you still have pains in the poetrine?
'Cause it's the saison of the grip
but we shouldn't exceed the possibility of a terrorist pain connected to a heart problems.
but this pain in the poetrin is a more important problem now
But I have difficulties to breathe
But I know that many people are all over me.
but we must treat every pain in the poetrine with the biggest
But you're normally respirating now, isn't it?
'Cause I've totally forgotten because of this pain in the poetrine
is that you have the print that we're compressing you the poetrine?
You're still disappointed
Would they like to be sick or have similar symptoms?
Do you have another chronic love like hypertension or something similar?
Do you have other diseases, chronic medical problems like diabetes?
Did you suffer more than this pain in the poetrine?
Do you have hypertension?
Did you suffer more than that?
Do you know what symptoms she had?
Do you see the image?
drinks a lot of liquid today
but I do tests for the diabetes
however, she has symptoms more similar to me
How much do you have to feed?
What is your tension?
if you always have a strong fish
if you have hundred or more
if you think your symptoms or problems are increasing to be examined closer
I had a party yesterday.
I've also had a lot of low
I had a party yesterday.
I felt a grievous pain here in the poetrine.
I have some difficulties to breathe.
I'll send you a picture
I've got the poitrine today.
I've got bad heads and a little feed today.
I say it's the grip.
I think it's a little shit.
Is it like a very serious person sitting on your poetrin?
it started by bad heads with the fever at least at the same time
It's wrong in the middle of my poetrin.
it's a surprising pain in the poetrine.
It's in my poetrine.
It's in the center of my poetrin
It's in the center of the poetrin
I have a pain in the poetrine.
I'm very worried about this terroric pain.
I want you to describe me this pain in the poetrine.
such as hypertension or diabetes
as a pile in the centre of the poetrine
Now against the fever you can take a paracetamol
Mary, how much time you have the symptoms now
Now you say you have a pain in the poetrine
Sometimes I've got bad at the poetrine
Okay, you have other symptoms in more or only this pain in the poetrine
Or somebody sits on your poetrin?
a little closely similar to the fever and the towels, the evil of head and the muscular pains
in full middle of poetrine
Show me on this image where you're wrong
since you have the fever
So you think some of these symptoms could be linked to the biggest?
So your children have some of these symptoms?
Talk to me about your pain in the poetrine
the shirt increases the night
the fever I had these two last days
the fever started to increase last night
it's Dr. Porter from the tri center in urgency room
Well, can you tell me a little more about your pain in the poetrine?
Well, I feel a pain before my body, here in my poetrin.
Well, I've got a strong pain in the poetrine.
Well, when I have this pain in the poetrine
What kind of pain do you have in the poetrine?
When did she start this pain in the poetrin?
Where are you wrong in the poetrin?
where you feel this turacic pain in the poetrine
you feel like an oppression in the poetrine
You know I have a diabete and all of this.
You said you have this pain in the poetrine
Quick increase of the accumulated incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The sumulated incidence of the disease in coronavirus (COVID-19) shows a similar development in the countries of the European Union/European Economic and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is in different cities, COVID-19 pandemia progresss quickly in all countries.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care services should be prepared for a few patients from the COVID-19 required care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a family of unknown ethiology pneumonie was reported to Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Prevention and Control Centre of Diseases described the agent responsible as a new coronavirus known under the name of coronavir 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since the disease resulting from infection in SARS-CoV-2 was baptized in coronavirus (COVID-19).
At this day, about 80% of the accommodations of COVID-19 presents a welcome affection, such as infection of respiratory paths with or without pneumony, which most people guarantee.
In approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 is a serious accommodation that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a serious form of intensive disease.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In the framework of this study, we assess the evolution of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/Economic Area (EU/EEC) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.), and compared with the evolution known by the Province of Hubai in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period of 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to promote, and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemia in the rest of the world is now followed by this country.
On 11 March 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (OMS) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemia.
In the editing of 5 March of Eurosurveilance 2020, Spitteri and al., the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe after the definition of the cases of the UNS.
In the EU/EEC, the first three cases confirmed have been reported by France on 24 January 2020 with people returning from Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1 727 described, including 17 750 cases and 1 441 since Italy.
Observation of the summary number and the accumulated incidence of COVID-19
In the European Prevention and Control Centre of Health (CEPCM), the number of cases signed in each country throughout the world, only received from official sources such as health ministers, national and regional health authorities of different countries and the OMS is updated everyday at 08 hours.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 in the EU/EEC and the United Kingdom, and to make a comparison with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we have calculated the achievement of 14 days of COVID-19, taking into account the natural development of COVID-19, within each EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, for the period of 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the total number of cases signed in each country at 15 March 2020 to 8 hours with the data of Italy for the period of 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development in EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of the incident achieved at 14 days of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed the Province of Hubei (Chinee) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, the sumulated incident of COVID-19 began to grow at the end of 21 February before to know a drastic increase at the range of 28 February 2020 (a further data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase of the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have submitted a similar increase of COVID-19 incidents (excluding data).
The Figure 2 presents the total number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom related to the data of Italy for the period of 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that at 15 March at 8:00, 15 other EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to the Italian only three weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases signed in COVID-19 increased fast in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the sumulated incident of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemia progresses to a comparable speed in all countries.
And it is, despite the fact that countries are in various towns and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patients ' choice protocols before being tested to confirm COVID-19, including for rattrapage tests.
In the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of the regions affected Italy indicated that about 10% of the patients arrived from COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that the hospitals and intensive services of these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or in intensive care services are currently available in the EU/EEE scale for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (not present data).
However, the systematic collection is necessary to complete the current monitoring data focused on the number of cases signed and death.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a major exchange of beds available in the intermediary and intensive services in Europe, which goes from 29,2 lits for 100 000 people in Germany to 4,2 lits in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 litres in intensive and intermediate care for 100 000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimations for each EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalised cases associated with a risk & gt; 90 % of the excessive capacity in intensive beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid evaluation of the CEPCM risks on COVID-19.
Since the cases were regrouped in some EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom and that hospitals and intensive care services generally acquire a specific regional population, the data on cases and increasing beds should be set at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistics Territory Units (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and the current evolution in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemia has progressed quickly in the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore be prepared for a Community transmission scenery supporting the SARS-CoV-2 and to increase the number of patients that are required by COVID-19, and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the areas affected in Italy.
As sublined by the recent rapid evaluation of the CEPCM risks, a fast, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to retain the propagation of SARS-COV-2, through a approach to enhancement approach, in the measure where rapid and precise increase of the case would not have been left enough time to deciders and hospitals to understand, accept and apply their response, as soon as nothing had been implemented.
The rapid evaluation of risks also reflects public health measures that allow the impact of the pandemia.
There is a short window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to reduce the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure of health services.
Without what, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries should face a few patients needing intensive care in the future days or weeks.
The epidemia of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has been introduced to more than 3000 dead and infected more than 800,000 people in China and others in the world, which provokes a humanitarian catastrophe.
As his homolog, the SARS-CoV, which introduced thousands of cases of SRAS in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by shoes and provoked similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 presents a seriousness and a middle death than the MISE, but it is more transmissive, and it affects the older persons than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase of the number of publications on this threat disease, this article is trying to provide an appropriate and exhaustive examination of this research in full exsorption.
We will approach the fundamental elements of epidemology, ethiology, virology, diagnostic, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still wait for answers, we hope that this exam will participate in better apprehensive and raising this serious disease.
The printemps Festival, on 25 January 2020, marked the Chinese, which has always been confronted to remain closing for the whole time of the gold week and for other weeks because of the propagation of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologated to coronavirus (CoV) which causes a serious respiratory syndrome in 2003, so it has been baptized by the World Health Organization (OMS) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemia started in Wuhan and was quickly propagated to the whole China before expansion at about 50 other countries throughout the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus was introduced more than 800,000 cases confirmed by COVID-19, with more than 40 000 patients who were hospitalized and more than 3 000 deaths.
For the WTO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number 1" potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), at least two months more than 200 works were published on the COVID-19, in particular in the areas of virology, epidemology, ethiology, diagnosis and treatment, from the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the sequence of virus, isolated from several patients.
This exam tries to synthese the progress of research on this new subject in full exorcising.
Since possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with the SRAS and another disease to coronavirus, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemia in 2012).
We will also make the point of what we learned until here in prevention and prognosis of the disease, and we will still take some questions in suspension but even urgently.
The coronavirus are traditionally considered as non-mortal pathogenes for the Human, which causes principally 15% around common rumes 4.
However, during this century, we have known two highly pathogenous coronavirus for the Human, to know the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, who have provoked an epidemia that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before they propagate quickly to many other countries with an elevated morbidity and death.
Current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemia of coronavirus of the recent history.
As presented in Fig.1.1, there were first unknown pneumony feeds reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of coronavirus was devoted.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
At times, the epidemia was quickly propagated to cities, provinces and neighbour countries.
On January 20, he was reported that health professionals were infected, suggesting that the interhuman transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in 40th, with interruption of all its public transports.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, on 41 cases confirmed, only 21 patients had been directly contacted with the market of the sea fruits of Wuhan, considered as the point of department of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the OMS qualified global health urgency epidemia.
At the reaction of this report, the disease was already propagated to the whole China and at about 50 other countries throughout the world (Fig.2).
In the measure where the situation is quickly developed, the final port and the severity of the epidemia remains to determine.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentrical study of 8 866 patients, including 4 021 cases confirmed by COVID-19, presented an updated view of the epidemia as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qha2bdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 infected persons of all age, but more than 30-65 years.
Before half (47,7%) infected persons were older than 50 years, they were very less than 20 years, and only 14 were less than 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0,31/100 000) than women (0,27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in holidays, mainly in the province of Hubei and equipment.
The average period between the appearance of symptoms and COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4,8 days (3,0-7,2).
The average period between symptoms and death was 9,5 days (4,8-13).
Base playing rate (R0) was 3,77 (IC to 95 %: 3,51-4,05) and the R0 adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people has increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which corresponds to the massive movements that have been placed before the Festival of the printemps in China.
The death of patients identified as a confirmed case was 1,44% (IC to 95%: 1,10-1,86%) and the adjusted death of all patients was 3,06% (IC to 95%: 2,02-4,59%).
The three major risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥ 60) and a severe pneumony.
The coronavirus constitutes a sub-famility of large virus developed with a simple ARN.
They can be classified in four kinds, to know alpha, beat, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the man who is alpha and beat.
The Glycoproteine Spike (S) is linked to the conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DP4) of its cell receptors for the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a memory fuse is produced.
The viral ARN genome is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic ARN associated with glucose glucose and nucleocapside proteins forming vessels containing viruses, which then fusion the plasmical membration to free the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99,98 % of genetic identity between 10 sequency examples preliminary on the original site of the epidemia, the market of Huanan Sea in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the transmission electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particules were detected in superfinal sections of human epithelium of respiratory paths.
Human ACE2 was identified as a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S SARS-CoV-2 protein is linked to the human ACE2 less stronger than the SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secret protein coded by orf8.
The orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of the IFN egg; however orf8 does not contain known areas or motives.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., the structure of the ACE2 ACE2 was fully presented to a 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the transporter of aminated acids B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which presents open and closed conformities, was assembled in the form of dime and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 could link two proteins S, which provides indications for recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be a terapeutic target for the crisis of medicines to eliminate infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Original and intermediate host
It has been established that the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV were driving for souris and that they were transferred to the human through cities and camelides, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the shoes were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is equal to 96% of the two coronavirus type SRAS, which originates bat-SL-CoVZX45 and-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary host that allowed the virus to frank the barrier of the species to infect the man remains unknown, and the way of transmission is still to exceed.
Ji, and al., have emerged the hypothesis that the virus could be transmitted to the man by the serpents, which would influence an homologic recombination within the protein S.
Following a study of Guangzhou researchers, in China, the palolin - a long museum mammifer in the long museum, often used in Chinese traditional medical medicine - may be the intermediary host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by genetic homologology to 99% of the coronavirus discovered in the SAS-CoV-2.
However, an exceeding 1% between two genoms is an important differences; it is therefore necessary to expect conclusions that allow the establishment of concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The physical-chimical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
The SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in sec environment and to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a very well similar properties.
It seems that the SARS-CoV-2 is sensible to ultraviolet rays and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ethanol is 75%, the desinfects based on chloro, the peracetic acid, the chloroform, and other gray solvents, but not chlorhexin, can effectively inactive the virus.
Human population in its assembly is generally contaminated by immunity in SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to studies previously made on other coronavirus, including the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognised by the immunary system of this by the reception of molecular motives (PRR), in particular the recipients of type C, the Toll (TLR), the NOD type receivers (NLR) and the RIG-I type receivers (RLR).
In various ways, the virus introduced the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthèse of type I (IFN) interferons that limit the propagation of the virus and accommod the macrophytose of viral antigeneses.
However, Protein N of SARS-CoV may allow the virus to escape immunitary responses.
Soon, immunitary immunitary response joints the fight against the virus.
lymphocytes T, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play a major role in defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate the B cells that produce specific anticorps of virus, and T CD8+ cells directly extinguish the infected cells.
T-assistance cells produce pro-inflammator cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by closing their appotosis.
Humoral immunity, with complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, anticorps isolated from a retabli patient have neutralised the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immunity system provides a localised explosion of the number of free radians, which can lead to serious lessons to the pumons and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisual deficiency, appears to death.
Infection in SARS-CoV-2, characterized by a disease in families, is more susceptible to affect older persons with comrbidities and females.
It is immediately admitted that persons exposed to a large number of virus or which immunitary functions are compromised more risks to be infected than others.
It is estimated that the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, but more than 3 to 7 days after a study made at 425 first cases mentioned in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average, for a fuel from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, has concluded at an incubation period of 4,8 days (3,0-7,2) after a demography of 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective period of 40-year-old incubation after the most precise period, in order to ensure that infected persons but asymptomatics do not transmit the virus.
Generally, persons exposed to, or infected by, the virus is carried out for 14 days.
Does the quarternain have to be expanded at 24 days?
The fever is often the first and the main symptom of COVID-19, and can be attached or not with other symptoms such as a seed tower, a supply, muscular pains, smokings, a bad hair, a rhinorrhee, a torahic pain, a diarrhee, nauseous and smoking.
Some patients presented a dispose and/or hypothesis a week after the disease appears.
In relation to several cases, patients have rapidly developed an alugum respiratory syndrome, a seed shock, a metabolic acid and a coagulopathie.
Patients present from the fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those present a egg fibre, even in the absence of the trial radiography, should be tested for the virus to allow an early diagnosis.
A Demographic Demographic study concluded of December 2019 showed that diseases were present from the fever 98%, a 76% steel, a diarrhee to 3%; 8% of the patients needed a vessel assistance.
Like conclusions were reported by two recent studies on a family and on a family appeared after the transmission of virus from a asymptomatic individual.
In the same way, a demographic study in 2012 showed that the major symptoms of patients arrived by MERS-CoV were from the fever (98%), a sheet tower (47%) and a dyspnee (55%).
However, 80% had needed a ventilator assistance, or more than the patients achieved from COVID-19, which is coherent with a higher legality of the MERS in relation to COVID-19.
A diarrhee (26%) and a diarrhee (21%) has also been observed in patients in MERS.
With regard to the MIDS, it has been established that the main symptoms were from the fever (99%100%), a sequency tower (29%75%), a diarrhee (40%42%), a diarrhee (20%25%) and a paint (13%25%), and that a vessel assistance was required for about 14 to 20% of the patients.
On 14 February, COVID-19 was 2%, for 66 576 cases confirmed in the world scale.
Comparedly, the mortality of the MISE in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8 096 cases confirmed.
For the MERS, after a demographic study held in June 2012, death was 37% for 2 494 cases confirmed.
A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6,47 with a trust range (IC) to 95 % of 5,71-7,23, while the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, death and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.
The data were suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to promote than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less legal.
Therefore, it is very difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemia that it was not for the MERS-CoV epidemies and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a family is often involved in a family or in a collection or vehicle, such as in the case of a cross.
Patients have often traveled or resided to Wuhan or in other areas affected, or have been contacted with infected persons or patients in the two weeks before the appearance of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be portors of virus without so much to present symptoms for over two weeks and that patients may be retablished by the virus ports, which sublines the need to increase the period of in 40th.
Patients present a normal or reduced number of white lymphocytes in the first cities.
For example, a lymphopeny with a number of white bullets &lt; 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes &lt; 1 × 109/L, and a high level of aminotransferase and a viremia were identified at 1 099 patients from COVID-19.
Some patients presented hepatitis enzymes, muscular enzymes and myoglobines high in blood, and most of them had a high level of C-reactive protein and the erythrocytary sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimmer rate, a degradation product of the fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased progressively.
Torahic radiography analyzes in most patients in the COVID-19, characterized by bilateral inequality shadows or a opacity to be depolated at the level of pumons.
Patients are often developing a typical pneumony, an aiguous pulmonary lesion and an aiguous respiratory syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, an infection infection, a liquid accumulation and a progressive fibrose compromes severely gas changes.
The disfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes includes a low level of surfactory and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of pulmonar collapse and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Thus, the most concerned tourist tests often matches the most severe form of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first Pathological Analysis of COVID-19 showed a disagreement of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membrums, a interstitical lymphocytical infiltration and the presence of multinatural syncytic cells in the pomons of a patient deceived infection and SDRA, which corresponds to those patients attracted by MIS and MERS.
The SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection has been used as main criteria for the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high level of negative false, which can accelerate the epidemia, clinical demonstrations began to be used for the diagnosis (which was not only on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the MIS diagnosis.
Thus, combination of medical anticipations, clinical demonstrations, laboratories and radiological tests is essential and imperative to establish effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a SERLOCK technical protocol based on the CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows to identify synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies with a reactive bandlet in less than one hour, without necessary sophistic equipment.
It is hoped that this new technology allows significantly to improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specifications would be concluded.
In the absence of experience in respect of the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support for patients in the COVID-19, although they have already used or proposed to treat other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatment with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressors, steroids, plasma of retablished patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of retablished patients has been proposed to treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all involved to develop antibodies and vaccins against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly attacked to the pumons in a first time and probably also in a measure, with other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gas-intensional system and reins.
However, a disfunction and a respiratory insufficientness constitutes the main threat for patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, a respiratory assistance is essential to reduce symptoms and save lives; it includes a general oxygennotherapy, a higher oxygenotherapy, a non-invasive ventilation and an invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the seriousness of the disease.
Patients who suffer severe respiratory symptoms should receive oxygenation by extracorporal membration (OMEC), a modified heart-volumen derivation technology used for treatment of heart suffices or critical respirators.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electrolytic equilibration, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sequence choices, and the protection of the functions of live organs is also essential for the patients achieved from SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that a excessive reaction of the immune system is cytokinic choc in patients with the MISE and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systematic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytotinas, including TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNα, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines include immunitary cells to free a lot of free radicaux, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivisual deficiency.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic choices, especially for several cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 anticorps, were used to treat cytokinic chocs.
Other immunosuppressors treatment for cytokinic chocs include the modulation of immunial response by cells T, the block of IFN-gam, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, lynatumumab, the signing of cytokine 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
The steroids, as immunosuppressors agents, were broadly used in the treatment of the MIS to reduce the gravity of inflammator lessons.
However, higher dose steroids have not been beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lensions in patients with the MISI and COVID-19.
Instead of this, they would ensure severe secondary effects, including an acelerated osteonecrosis, which would affect significantly the prognosis.
However, the careful review to short corticosteroid cycles of low dose was recommended for patients presenting a serious form of COVID-19.
During the reform of this report, no effective antiviral treatment has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of remedesivir, a nuclear analogue, has occurred effectively in an American patient achieved from COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed in the origin by Gilead for the treatment of diseases produced by Ebola and Marburg.
The remedesivir also showed a possible inhibition of other simple virus in ARN, including the MERS and the SRAS.
In view of these statements, Gilead transmitted the composition to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and results are highly expected.
Furthermore, the baricitinib, the interferon-alpha, the lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirine were advanced as potential treatment for patients who suffer aged respiratory symptoms.
A diarrhee, nauseous, smoking, hepatitis launch, and other indesiderable effects can occur after a treatment combined with the lopinavir/ritonavir association.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients must be carefully controlled.
plasma of retablished patients and anticorps production
Collection of blood with patients who have been healthy from a county disease to treat other patients who suffer the same disease or protect healthy individuals of this disease is an anestrical practice.
Retablished patients often present a relatively high rate of anticorps against pathogene.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to fight pathogenes and other foreign bodys; they recognize unique molecules in pathogenes and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was thus extracted from a group of patients who were healthy from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously accurate diseases.
Their symptoms were improved in 24 hours, in association with a reduction of inflammation phenomenon, a reduction of viral charges and a increase of oxygen saturation in blood.
However, a check and clarification is necessary to provide this method for a large scale use as no specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, given therapeutic effects, some inconvenients associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, anticorps can introduce excessive stimulation of immunitary response and provoke a syndrome of cytokine liberation, potentially fatal.
The concentration of anticorps in blood is generally low, and the request of plasma to treat patients seriously disease is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific anticorps enough quickly to fight a world epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells of retablished patients and to identify the genetic codes that cooling the relevant anticorps or to search effective anticorps against the main proteins of virus.
This would allow rapidly to increase anticorps production.
The MTC is used from thousands of people in China to treat a large variety of diseases.
However, its effects are widely on the combination of multiple components in a form that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theory of the MTC.
Most effective components remain little or not of all known in the measure where it is difficult to extract them and check them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, because of a specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the major alternative treatment for patients who are in moderate or in remission of a serious form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen actively discovered for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest COVID-19 guarantees were observed in China’s provincies with 87% of their patients, including Gansu province (63,7%), Nixia region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei’s province, which had not recognised only 30% of the patients arrived in COVID-19, presents the lower guarantee (13%).
However, it is a more closer comparison since many other factors, such as the number of patients and the gravity of the disease, should be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study compared with a treatment using the western medicine (MO) and a combinated treatment associated with the MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time of return to a normal body temperature, the time of loss of symptoms and the hospitalisation period was very shorter for the MO+MTC group than only for the MO group.
More impressing, the agreement of symptoms (leading to seriously) was lower for the MO+MTC group than for only for the MO group (7,4 % against 46,2 %); and the mortality was also monetary for the MO+MTC group than for only for the MO group (8,8 % against 39 %).
However, the efficiency and the independence of the MTC remains still to be determined by the control rates carried out to greater scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize action mechanism and clarify the effective components of MTC treatment or their associations, if possible.
Persons identified as probable or confirmed in cases of COVID-19, generally feel a living concern for this highly county and dead disease, and those placed in 40-year-old are also testing a feeling of ennuy, solitity and anger.
Furthermore, the symptoms of infection, such as feeding, hypoxie and toux, and the indesiderable effects of treatment, such as insomnie incorporated by corticosteroids, can lead to a increased anguishness and psychological threat.
In the first time of the MIDIE epidemia, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, in particular, a constant depression, anxiety, panic crisis, a psychomotric excitation, psychotic symptoms, an aggressive confusional state and even suitable tendency.
The obligatory research of contacts and implementation in 40th, in the context of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemia, can increase the accuracy and enhance certain crimes of diseases in respect of the effects of contagion, quartertain and stigmatization of their family and their friends.
So mental health care should be provided to patients achieved from COVID-19, individuals identified as possible cases, people in contact with these populations, and to any other person in depression.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, a clear communication with regular and specific updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemia and the treatment plans, as well as the use of professional e-mail equipment and use of the professional contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal residues and human beings infected on vulnerable hosts, and often are supplementary of antiviral treatment in the control of epidemies caused by emmergent viruses.
The efforts were developed to develop vaccins based on protein S, in order to produce powerful neutralising anticorps long-term and/or to introduce protection immunity against SARS-CoV.
Living vaccins were evaluated on animal models for the SRAS.
However, the in vivo efficiency of these potential vaccins in age and models submitted to a legal provocation and their protection against infection by a synotic virus remains still to determine, in the measure where no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the MISE has been exceeding 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
However, MERS' s sporadical cases and families continue to declare themselves in the Middle East and in other regions because of the persistency of synototic sources in final areas.
Various vaccination strategys have been developed by the MERS through inactive virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nano-particular vectors, particularly appearing to virus and recombinant proteins, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccin against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunized individuals is a urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemia.
However, it is a real deficit due to the important period (18 months in average) necessary to develop a vaccin and dynamic variations of coronavirus.
In the measure in which it is an emergency disease, COVID-19 just involves its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the diseases are progressively restored.
However, under the MISE and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a Morbidity and a higher death for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a pronostic model is essential for health agencies to priority their services, in particular in the areas containing limited resources.
According to the clinical studies until here, factors that can affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients achieved from COVID-19 are the following (Tableau (Tableau 33):
age: the age was the main factor for the MISI prognosis, and it also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
The COVID-19 is mainly involved by age 30 to 65, with 47,7% of more than 50 years, according to a study of 866 cases, as previously described.
The patients who had needed intensive care were more susceptible to present subjacents and complications, and were exceeding older (66-year-old age of 51 years), suggesting the age as a prognosic factor for patients coming to COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100000 against 0.27/100 000), as previously described.
Comrbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 required intensive cares are more susceptible of suffering of alike and arythmical illness.
The heart events were also the main cause of death in patients in the MIDI.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to the positive cholangiocytes of the ACE2, which can introduce hepatitis disfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is necessary to note that the age and the presence of under-jacent health problems are strongly corrupted and can interfere with each other.
The results of anormal laboratory: the C-reactive Proteine (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissular lessons; it has been advanced as potential pronotic factor of disease, response to treatment and health.
Correlation between CRP and severity and COVID-19 was also proposed.
Furthermore, a high level of dehydrogenease lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase (ALT) and nitrogen creatine (CK) can also participate in the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially at the level of heart and smoke, and are released in case of tissular lessons.
They therefore constitute traditionally of heart or hepatic disfunction markers.
Higher clinical symptoms: Terroric radiography results and the timely progress of clinical symptoms must be considered in association with other elements for the definition of prognosic and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: as previously described, the steroids are immunosuppressors commonly used in the treatment of infectious diseases to reduce the gravity of inflammatory laces.
Since the dose of corticosteroids has been largely used for several cases of SRAS, many survivors have submitted a vacational osteonecrose resulting in a permanent incapacity and a medium life quality.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients attaining COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short short.
mental stress: As previously described, COVID-19 epidemia has introduced a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who have often known a long period of 40-year, extreme incertitude and nearly death or other patients.
It is immediate to propose a psychological association and support on the long term to help these individuals to override this street and find a normal life.
According to demographical studies until here, COVID-19 seems to present different epidemological characteristics from the MID.
More than replies in low respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 is also efficiently replied in the higher respiratory paths and does not track any symptoms in the first phase of infection, incentive of coronavirus to the origin of the common rhymes.
Therefore, recently infected individuals or incubation period can produce a large quantity of virus during their daily activities, which includes significantly the control of epidemia.
However, it was considered that the SARS-CoV was transmitted by patients seriously disease, with a very weak probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemia is therefore very serious and difficult to control that it was not the MIDS.
The most important efforts are currently developed in China, including the border of Wuhan and the neighborhood cities, and the fourth-totality of the population in order to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a rareness of the epidemia.
The most optimist estimates suggested that epidemia will end in March and that the decreasing phase will lead to 3 to 4 months.
However, all experts do not share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., considers that COVID-19, which seems to be very infectious than the MISE, will not be exceeded in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., have established a model to prevent the epidemic exemption and have concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that the SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the preliminary of the average nasal cornet and the greenhouse of patients restored, two weeks after they were out of the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode inside the grip.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the implemented strategy would be functioned.
According to the initial previsions, Ebola's virus had to travel to a million cases and a half million of deaths.
However, through a 40-year-old and a strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for the SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 affects infectional terms to finally exceed or develops in a less pathogenic virus coexistent with the human.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemia with the SRAS and MERS is provided next (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by towels or extents, and also possiblely by direct contact with counted materials.
The virus was also identified in seals, thus devoting a new foco-oral transmission.
A recent study on 138 patients declared that 41% of the cases were possible for neocomial infections, with 17 patients presenting early diseases and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore necessary to take precaution measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, neighbors and colleagues of diseases, and even any person can be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is resident in the basic mask port; the use of cyrurgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in control of the propagation of virus.
Cyrurgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected gases or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (1860) masks ensure a protection against the inhalation of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5 % of the entirely able viruses; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measured at about 85 nm.
Since particules are achieved to travel five cyrurgical masks on each other, it is immediate that health professionals in direct contact with patients bring N95 (1860s) and not chirurgical masks.
Furthermore, health professionals need to take adjusted isolation blocks to reduce the contact with viruses.
Virus can also infect a person in ocular way.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor discovered to be infected in the SARS-CoV-2 while he brought a N95 mask; the virus could have penetrated his body in ocular way because of an inflammation.
Thus, health professionals should also bring transparency visions or patients’ protection pumps to contact patients.
For the populations involving or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to launch their hands with wisdom that often desinfects more than normally, to be limited to maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected persons.
It is recommended to keep a distance from a meter with the diseases.
These measures constitutes effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the propagation of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for Human, its highest homology level with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, China must have placed in high warning after the MISS epidemy in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Control and Prevention Centre of Wuhan's diseases would be able to prevent and contain the disease, as the new virus was a little critical, that it had a limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has introduced a notable reliance, particularly when the whole country was prepared for the Festival of the presimps, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Whan was missing.
The Chinese control agents of diseases must be taken from lessons and take the measures involved.
For example, these agencies should be shown more prudent in their public announces, because each word has been considered and can affect the behaviour and the decisions of the population; (2) demonstrate more sensitivity and reactivity in respect of the innormal clinical data instead of expecting reports of doctors or official organizations; (3) show more restrictive to contain a potential epidemia at the beginning of the population instead of trying to raise the population; and (4) reaper from relevant citizens and to ensure the sensitivity of the ecological population, but also to be restrictive, and to improve the social resistance system.
The COVID-19 epidemia caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 has started the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, during the reform of this report, she was expanded to the whole China and at about 50 other countries throughout the world.
In the measure where this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that COVID-19 symptoms are also close to those of the IMS, COVID-19 is born as an impression of already-vu.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain epidemia and treat the patients.
COVID-19 affects young people more than young and more men than women; seriousness and death level are more important in age.
The MISE presents more death than COVID-19 (10,91 % against 1,44 %).
The transmission of COVID-19 is even possible in absence of symptoms, while the IMS was mostly transmitted by patients severely disease; it is therefore more difficult to contain COVID-19 propagation.
This explains in part why the SARS-CoV-2 has been very faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Regular ARN detection tests of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for certain patients attaining COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients recovered may be again positive to virus.
This increases significantly the risk of propagation.
Despite rapid research progress on COVID-19, several critical issues remain still in suspension, particularly:
Where's the SARS-CoV-2?
Although a genetic homologic at 96 % was established between SARS-CoV-2 and two MIDI-type coronavirus, it is not sufficient to conclude with sure that SARS-CoV-2 provides chirops.
What is the intermediary species that allowed the transmission of the virus of the initial host, for example the shoes, to the Human?
Without answer to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupt effectively the transmission, and the epidemia can be retraced at all time.
Molecular modelisation and biochimical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly in the respiratory cells and how does it affect patological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a fast and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long is the epidemia going to stay?
How does the virus develop on the genetic plan during interhuman transmission?
Will he develop in global pandemia, disappear as the MISE or reform regularly as the grip?
It is essential, even if it can take time, get answers to all these questions and to many others.
However, the expenditures that should be increasing, we have no other choice but to finish this epidemia quickly possible to renew the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two virus is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rares immunodepressed patients presented a severe infection of lower respiratory paths.
The first remote MIDIS at the end of 2002 in the provincies of Guangdong in China.
Unless the super-transmittors, it was estimated that each case could be at least two secondary cases with a period of incubation included between 4 and 7 days, the pipe of the viral load that appears on the 10th day of the disease.
The patients infected by the SARS-CoV are initially presented a myalgie, heads of head, fever, a disease and freshness, disspnee followers, tows and respiratory depression as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false tests of the hepatic function and an elevated inspired creature are current anomalies observed in the laboratorie analysis in case of suspicion of SRAS.
Different alveolic launchions, the proliferation of the hospital cells and the increase of macrophages are also observed in the patients of the MIS.
At least 20 to 30% of the patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to low respiratory paths, several organs including gastro-intensional paths, smooth and rain can also be infected in these serious cases, often accompanied with a cytokinic choc, which may be particularly fatal in immunodepressed patients.
Since, great efforts have been dedicated to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated in a child of 7 months in the Netherlands, at the end of 2004.
Initially, he was prevalent to young children, age persons and immunodepressed patients suffering respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjonctive, fever and broncholite is current in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal prevalence of a boy of 8 months suffering pneumony in the Netherlands.
Although he was identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present in the whole world.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with a obstructive laringite, also called croup.
The same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year hospitalised man because of a pneumonian and a bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Instead of HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present at the global level, caused by moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOV have the ability to transform effectively and to continue in humans, they also become less virus or pathogenes.
Another secondary epidemia occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
The clinic demonstrations of the MERS are similar to the SRAS and are characterized by an evolutionary aiguous pneumony.
In contrast to the MISE, many patients who suffer the MERS have also developed an aggressive renal disaster, which is characteristics of the MERS in relation to HCOV pathology.
More than 30% of the patients presents gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhee and smoking.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2 500 cases confirmed in laboratories have been reported with a high dead level of 34,4%, which makes the MERS-CoV one of the most known viruses in humans.
A diarrhee is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogene, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected in SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to its quick propagation in the world.
The comparation and opposition of the SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCOV have reflected very interesting similitudes and differences.
First, the incubation period and the time of HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the six other HCOV.
Secondly, the gravity of COVID-19 symptoms is situated between the SARS-CoV and the four Community HCOV (see HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small sub-group of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of infection in SARS-CoV, although the proportion is easily lower.
Finally, as the other HCOV, the SARS-CoV-2 can be deleted in seals.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenicity and its sustainable diffusion after transmission to man, will have an influence on the last destination of the current COVID-19 epidemia.
The four Community HCOV causes moderate symptoms are well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be the survivors of the previous HCOV pandemics.
In order to do this, HCOV must be replied to human in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptative mutations compatible with the restrictive factors of the host.
In this optic, more SARS-CoV-2 epidemia persists and more the number of infected persons is important, there are more chances that the virus is totally adapted to human.
If it is appropriate, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a 40-year-old or by other infections control measures.
Since many years, the four CoV acquired in community circulates within the population, declaring a simple rhume in immunocompetent subjects.
These virus are not required to reserve animals.
In addition, the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, highly pathogenes, have not been adapted to the human and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their synonymous reserves and look for a chance to get potential human objectives, probably through one or more intermediary and extensive hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 provides similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and to four HCOV in community.
However, it is more pathogenic than the HCOVs acquired in community and less pathogene than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it will be totally adapted to human beings and will circulate among these lasts without residence or intermediary animals.
Before discussing HCOV animal origins, we will be very useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, reserve, intermediary and extensive HCOV hosts.
A animal serves an HCOV host if it opens a nearest ascensor that shares a higher homology at the level of nuclear sequence.
The origin virus often has been well adapted and is not pathogene for his host.
In the same way, a host to reserve opens the HCOV continued and long-term.
In addition, HCOV can also apply to the intermediary host and even establish a long-term enemy.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reserve host.
Especially, since 80% of the animals of Guangzhou market are presented anticorps SARS-CoV, the possibilities that several species of small mammifers may also be used to be excluded.
These shoes are positive to anti-SARS-CoV anti-CV and the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatcoV HKU3.
These studies have put the bases of a new concept according to which the shoes are the housing human pathogenes.
The conversion enzyme of human angiotensine 2 (ACE2) is known as the recipient of SARS-CoV.
Although a higher homologation between these two viruses is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parents of the SARS-CoV and that souris chauffes are not the host to reserve immediately from SARS-CoV.
That's why the shoes can't be the host to reserve the MERS-CoV intermediary.
Furthermore, studies in the Middle East showed that drugs were seropositive to the specific anticorps of the MERS-CoV, as well as the original chambers of the Middle East in several African countries.
Furthermore, infected chambers express the virus not only by respiratory paths, but also by feeding way, which also constitutes the main path of excretion of shoes.
We can't exclude the possibility that the pool is one of the intermediary animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than the separator of the beast-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 of the sphere.
Recommendation is a broad factor of the evolution of Beta-CoV.
Scientifics remain divided on the immediate synotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Further than HCOV highly pathogenes, the synonymous origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 were also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could be both exhausted from the HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1, while the parents of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in the rounds.
Otherwise, HCOV-229E was genétically associated with another cow-souris cow, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediary hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 franked the barrier of species to infect humans from the household betail in the areas of 1890, a respiratory infection pandemia was signed.
The history of inter-species of HCOV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the near HCOV-229E chauve-souris has been found.
First, in contrast to the alphabets, men can have a contact with the soir-shirts in a shared ecological skin.
In addition, humans have extreme contacts with alpacas.
Then, the alpha-coV alpha-coV of the HCOV-229E hair-souris are many and not pathogenes in the shoes, while the alpha-coV alpha-coV has caused an epidemia of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV alpha-coV has not been found in the wild animals.
In fact, the shoes are the direct source of human pathogen virus, including the virus of the rage, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not amazing that HCOV-229E can transmit directly to human.
Another opportunity, while the alpha-coV of the shoes are to be reserved genetic of HCOV-229E, alpha and dromaders could use intermediate hosts transmitting virus to humans, exactly in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-species transmission of drugs and drugs to humans.
The development origin of the MERS-CoV found in souris chaves is known through its initial identification and has also been strengthened by further discoverys.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV is present in drugs since decades.
It was well adapted to these chambers who have passed from the median host to hosts to stable natural reserve.
In contrast to the role of chambers in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of spolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
Especially, the pool-CoV beasts are highly pathogenes in the pools.
Many inter-species transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 animals to human animals have been included or excluded from future studies.
Firstly, the shoes could be the host to reserve from a virus appeared in SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share a ecological smoke with smooth shoes through the depth or carbon mines.
Secondly, the spolins could be one of the intermediate exploitants hosts with which a virus linked to the SRAS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by the depth and the consumption of smoking flesh.
It is possible that many mammifers including home animals are sensitive in SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recommendation and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have been located within a third species that has been once contacted with shoes and shoes.
The research on the animal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 are currently running.
Compared with other viruses in ARN by simple breeding, the estimated mutation rates of CoV may be considered as “modified” to“ higher” with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, according to the CoV adaptation phase for new hosts.
However, CoV mutation rates are about a million times more than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the mutation rate is often higher when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
In relation to SARS-CoV, presenting a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a higher adaptation to human.
We can assume that he has already been adapted to another host near humans.
Further than SARS-CoV-2, it is also applied to MERS-CoV, which has well adapted to drugs.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic derive makes vaccins and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 short-term ineffective.
Thirdly, the CoVs change randomly and frequency of models in the replication of the ARN through a single mechanism of choice-copy.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recovery were found once for HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, and for the CoV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and the Battery CoV-HKU9.
Interaction virus host connected with transmission
Besides these three viral factors above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor that influences the inter-species transmission.
The recommendation of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive proofs during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other terms, these two replacements of amineous acids may be key factors for human adaptation.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver as SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30 % between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the protein S means that the aspect of this protein S with human ACE2 may have been higher.
In fact, an electronic croomicroscopie studio indicates a 10-20 times above this connection in relation to the human ACE2 and the S SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-recipient may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, HCOV-NL63 is also linked to the ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCOV receivers, such as the amnopeptide N for HCOV-229E, and the silic acid 9-O-acetilized for HCOV-OC43.
The difference of hosts between humans and natural hosts of HCOV, such as souris, dromaders and roundors, could be a barrier to interspece transmission.
New HCOV economy: return to the department case
The diversity of the Cove-Souris CoV offers many new HCOV emergency opportunities.
In this meaning, the CoV Cove-Souris are genetic reserves of HCOV.
The ORF8 was considered as important in adaptation to humans, because the SAS-CoV-virus was isolated, but ORF8 was codified with different ORF8 proteins.
This removed ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressed as a adaptive mutation that favors the change of host.
Recommendation sites were also identified in Nsp9, most of Nsp10 and some nsp14.
In the same way, it was shown that MERS-CoV epidemia had known recombination episodes between various lines, which were produced in the drugs in Saudi Arabia.
While a ORF4 could be observed in the viruss of the shoes and the room associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpha-coV presents a simple nuclear insertion, generating a detail of the reading frame.
Finally, the development of new HCOV is also stimulated by the electoral pressure exercised in their hosts to reserve.
Asymptomatical cases or moderate symptoms were detected when CoVs were infected, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and souris.
He seemed that souris chaves were well adapted to the CoV of anatomic and physiological view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in souris chains are effectively reduced by the CV pathology.
Furthermore, the high level of reactions of oxygen (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of the shoes can be removed by the CoV replication and affect the "relection" by exoribonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and would be located to highly pathogene smokes when they are entered into a new host.
CoV Sums may also develop by recombination, enhancing the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics destined to adapt the host.
So, it's not a hazard if three new HCOV are appeared during the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenes or causes moderate symptoms in their hosts to store such as chambers and chambers.
They react solidly without providing a strong immunitary response of the host.
This is where the secrets of the observance of asymptomatical portors and that causes a serious infection in humans.
The serious symptoms are essentially from the hyperactive in the immunial response and cytokinic choc; more immunitary response is strong, more polmonary lessons are severe.
However, in the asymptomatical porters, immunitary response was discovered from the CoV replication.
The same solution strategy of immunitary response may have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, type I interferon administration should be beneficial at least in the early phase of infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the active of NLRP3 inflamsome is disfaced in the shoes.
Following this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a 95% of nuclear homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a CoV of 96 % of nuclear homology shared with SARS-CoV-2.
Beasts-CoV of the spanol were discovered similarly to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the spollin may be one of the intermediary hosts or that the beast CoV of the span may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs were returned under the fire of the ramp because of the recent epidemia of SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists in the dramater for a long time.
These chambers are an important transport means and a major source of flesh, lake, cooking and lake for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to offer all rooms to control the MERS, as it has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in chambers, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could be deceived and caused epidemies.
More synonymous CoVs circulate in nature.
Especially, the CoV of Cauve-Souris, which is very high for the synonymotic potential.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unusing contacts between human and animals.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is a opportunity for accounting.
A continued monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand the CoV and their natural hosts, which will be useful in the prevention of transmission of animals to human and future epidemies.
In order to conclude, the most effective means for the man to prevent viral synoposes is to keep away from the ecological weaknesses of the natural soldiers of synoposes.
First, if SAS-CoV-2 parent virus is transmitted to pools, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances the shirts and the balls could share the same ecological skin.
Secondly, if the shirts play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with shirts.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of real intermediary host, he remains to explain how he interacts with different species, including men, shoes and hairs.
Whatever it is a chew-souris, a pool or a other mammifer should be identified by SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parents who are observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grip or rhume, for example, without laying the hands before touching the eyes, the neck or the mouth (e.g. the mukes).
The main medical objective of the lavage of hands is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacterias, viruses or other microorganisms that are subject to disease) and chemical products, which can be nocifed or caused by disease.
The lavage of the hands has many benefits for health, including reduction of the propagation of grip, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infected diarrhee causes; reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reduction of child mortality rate in home-building.
In developing countries, children's deathrates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhee can be reduced by introducing simple manual changes, such as the lavage of hands to science.
Pneumony, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of death in children at less than five years, which makes about 1,8 million victims per year.
Join, the diarrhee and the pneumony train the death of about 3,5 million children each year.
The lavage of the hands also protects the impety, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Effect delegate, the lavage frequency of the hands can smooth the hair by providing a quoted desequence.
A Danish study of 2012 declared that the excessive lavage of the hands could lead from the eczyme or a dermatite at the hands level, characterized by a smoke and demeaners, and particularly frequently in health workers.
The lavage is also considered as one of the symptoms of the complicative obsessional difficulty (TOC).
The deparation twice per year, associated with the lavage of the hands to the savour and the daily browsing of the dents with a fluored dentification, is in the heart of this national programme.
It was also achieved with success in Indonesia.
The main action of knowledge and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not a efficient cleaning for the pool because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the earth, are hardly solved in the water.
The solid knowledge, because of its re-usable nature, can cover battery issues of previous use.
In this day there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antiseptics or the recommended desinfects allows to object the organisms resident to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even though the summers resistant to antibiotics are not the fruit of antibacterian sciences, these lasts could not be effective as well as announced.
Further than the tensioactive and protector of the pool, the most complex forms can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), served to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with an antimicrobian function, and other protein agents (also true, vitamines, mental, extracts).A rich analyze of the public health school of Oregon’s University indicated that the ordinary assess were also effective as the anti-bactors of the individuals who contain the individuals and striking, to prevent and elimiter their handmaids.
The hot water used to lay the hands is not enough hot to kill the batteries.
Bacterias are very faster than the temperature of the body (37 °C).
However, the teeth and saving water is more efficient than the fresh and saving water to eliminate natural oils of sale and bacteria.
However, in contrast to the popular believe, scientists declared that the use of teeth water would not contribute to reduce the microbian load on the hands.
A desinfect or an antiseptic for the hands is an hygiene product of non-show hands.
Most of them are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with an extraordinary agent such as the carbomer (acrilic polymer) to obtain a yellow, or to a humeting such as glycerine to get a liquid or museum for a larger use facility and reduce the effect that is safe of the alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen massyde increases antimicrobian activity.The desinfects for hands containing at least 60 to 95 % of alcohol are effectively exciting grapes.
Hydroalcool solutions kill bacterias, multiresisting bacterias (SARM and ERV), tuberculose and certain viruses (with HH, herpes, VRS, Rhinovirus, vaccin, grip and hepatitis), and campaigns.
Hydroalcool solutions are almost ineffectively against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenergy.A sufficient quantity of desinfecting for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used to be used to well move or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is provided for their use facility and their rapid elimination activities of microorganisms; however, they should not replace a right hand lavage as if you have no water and they have hands.
The frequency of hydroalcoolical solutions may lead to a quoted sequence if the formula is not strengthened by emotions and/or hydratic agents.
The insurance effect of the alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glucerine and/or other emoticons to the formula.
In the context of clinical tests, hydroalcool solutions containing emolydients have provoked just less exciting and cutaneous security than we know or detergent antimicrobians.
The allergic contact dermatite, contact urticary or hypersensitivity for alcohol or additional in hydro-alcool solutions are weird.
Despite their efficiency, non-contained products do not exceed the organic materials presented on the hands, but do not only desinfect them.
That is why the desinfects for the hands are not so efficient as the knowledge and the water to avoid propagation of many pathogen agents, since these last remains on their hands.
The efficiency of desinfects for alcohol hands depends strongly on ingrédients and formula, and has always been lower than the alcohol and desinfects based on alcohol.
More recently, the forms used by benzalconium chlorure have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobian activity after the application, in the differences of the alcohol, which the effectiveness has been attained after repeated use, probably due to indesiderable progressive quantitative reactions.
The skin or earth can be more efficient than the only water, but less than they know it.
Who more is, if the earth or scenario is contaminated by microorganisms, it is risked to increase the propagation of diseases instead of raining it.
Instead of the science, the scene is also a desinfect agent because, in contact with water, it forms a alcalin solution.
The OMS recommends the scene or sable as alternative to the science when it is not available.
Moving your hands with the current teeth or frog water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of water-based water points, while the water temperature does not seem to be different.
Moving a generous quantity of knowledge on the hands by smoking one against another, without forgetting the dose of the hands, between the hairs and the rings.
The science removes the grass of the hair, and studies indicate that people are trying to launch their hands more seriously when they use knowledge than with water only.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
Action to smooth creation from the friction, which helps to eliminate the grass of the skin, and to smooth more time to get away more than the smokes.
Run up goodly to the current water.
The smoking in a stagnant water bathroom can lead to the retamination of the hands.
Security with a own or free air service.
Moiled and humid hands are more easier to recognize.The most frequently forgotten areas are the pound, the pound, the spaces between the hair and the bottom of the bottoms.
artificial skins and branchs to scale branches can be able to gain microorganisms.
A hydrated location is often recommended to refuse to have seed hands; the cutaned security favorises the appearance of quoted lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to launch their hands when the rocket and/or knowledge is not available. For example, to cooling water from a bidon or a sustained and performed hot and/or to use the skin if necessary, in developing countries.In the situations where water advance is limited (as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economise the water, such as “type-taps” and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses an suspended cross using a corner, and a pedal that allows you to give a small quantity of water on the hands and a science bread.
The efficiency of the hands is a essential part of the manual hygiene process, but the best way to settle the hands in public tours is discussed.
Moreover, more research suggests that paper services are more hygiene than electric seeds than often found in the toilets.
After the lavage and swallowing hands to the hot-term air, it was declared that the total number of bacteria increased in average of 194% on the bottoms and 254% on the pawls.
The shopping at the age-day shoes had an average increase of the total number of bacterias on the pool of 42 % and on 15 % paths.
After the shopping of the hands, the following variables of the bacteria number were observed:
There are many different sequence-main manufacturers, and the seeds were compared to the switch using paper service.
The lavage of hands with desinfecting lenettes is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of science and water.
Hydroalcool solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that exhibit reminders when the hospital personnel forget to lay his hands.
The medical lavage of the hands must lead at least 15 seconds, using a generic quantity of savour and water or ice to move and smooth every part of the hands.
The hands must be broken against each other through walking between the hairs.
After the switch, the paper service should be used to close the robotnet (and open the output door the event).
The objective of the lavage of the hands in health structures is to remove pathogene microorganisms (“girmes”) and to escape their transmission.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
after an exposition to blood/to a biological liquid;
before a aseptic geste; and
All bottles must be removed.
In the framework of this procedure, it is necessary to launch its hands and forwards, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
In the shipment, it is necessary to disappear the water on the front brains to the hands.
To reduce the propagation of herms, it is better to lay his hands or to use an antiseptic for the hands before and after being occupied by a sick person.
With regard to the control of infections in the hospitals, the main benefits of the lavage were obtained during the first 20 % of the lavage, and there were only few additional benefits to increase the frequency of the hands of lavage at least 35%.
More research needs to find the most effective interventions in various health structures.
For example, in the largest part of the rural Africa, it is amazing to find robots to launch their hands closely to private or public tolets, although there are economic options to build hands-water stations.
However, the low loading rates of hands can also be imputable to tenage habits, instead of a missing saving or water.
Once the minimum standards are achieved, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hands-lavage stations can be included in the campaigns for promoting the hygiene of the hands that are carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
The World Day of Lavage Hand is another example of sensibilisation campaign that wishes to promote the evolution of the conduct.Suspends to the coronavirus pandemia of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoisy to illustrate the lavage of hands.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands to science is much more valuable than other water and exploitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were two of the fatigue fatigue called mysmes.
For example, in Germany, shows illustrating the “good hands shipping techniques ” were located near the eggs in public tours and in the office buildings and airports.
The expression “laying hands” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complied of something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to launch their hands after having received this type of thoughts are less attached to other compensative measures of purification, such as the beneficiary.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam requires to lay his hands before and after every food.

'Cause it's the saison of the grip
It is also necessary to submit that the artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes of virus genes, which are likely to follow the pressures exercised in the selection, especially by the immunitary system of the host.
For example, the loss of ORF4 is complete in the HCOV-229E prototype socket, due to a delegation of two nucleotides.
While a ORF4 could be observed in the viruss of the shoes and the room associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpha-coV presents a simple nuclear insertion, generating a detail of the reading frame.
Finally, the development of new HCOV is also stimulated by the electoral pressure exercised in their hosts to reserve.
Asymptomatical cases or moderate symptoms were detected when CoVs were infected, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoVs and souris.
He seemed that souris chaves were well adapted to the CoV of anatomic and physiological view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in souris chains are effectively reduced by the CV pathology.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killed cells in the shoes is removed by the positive regulation of the recipient inhibiting the natural killed NKG2/CD94 cells and the low expression of the molecules of the major complex of class I.
Furthermore, the high level of reactions of oxygen (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of the shoes can be removed by the CoV replication and affect the "relection" by exoribonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and would be located to highly pathogene smokes when they are entered into a new host.
CoV Sums may also develop by recombination, enhancing the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics destined to adapt the host.
So, it's not a hazard if three new HCOV are appeared during the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenes or causes moderate symptoms in their hosts to store such as chambers and chambers.
They react solidly without providing a strong immunitary response of the host.
This is where the secrets of the observance of asymptomatical portors and that causes a serious infection in humans.
The serious symptoms are essentially from the hyperactive in the immunial response and cytokinic choc; more immunitary response is strong, more polmonary lessons are severe.
However, in the asymptomatical porters, immunitary response was discovered from the CoV replication.
The same solution strategy of immunitary response may have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is particularly strong in the shoes.
Therefore, type I interferon administration should be beneficial at least in the early phase of infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the active of NLRP3 inflamsome is disfaced in the shoes.
Following this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 has appeared according to the general scheme by which the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV have emerged.
While a 95% of nuclear homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a CoV of 96 % of nuclear homology shared with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on markets were discovered as similar virus porters in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Beasts-CoV of the spanol were discovered similarly to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the spollin may be one of the intermediary hosts or that the beast CoV of the span may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are issues, there is no evidence indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 has been made by man, that it is voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs were returned under the fire of the ramp because of the recent epidemia of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV study of the CoV in Scouris and other animals has strengthened our understanding of the role that plays synotic origins and animal residues in the transmission of HCOV to human.
Many fatal data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are originating from the chauve-souris and are transferred to the human through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection provides contact between human and cities present on markets, the closement of fresh product markets and the exploitation of citizens that were found would have been able to end effectively to SARS epidemia.
Following the same reason, the pools should be removed from the fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of synoposes, taking into account the detection of many lines of beast-coV of petrols strictly related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question to know whether the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to the man by springs and other mammifers and, in the event, however, the transmission will be determined in the following studys.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists in the dramater for a long time.
These chambers are an important transport means and a major source of flesh, lake, cooking and lake for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to offer all rooms to control the MERS, as it has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in chambers, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could be deceived and caused epidemies.
More synonymous CoVs circulate in nature.
Especially, the CoV of Cauve-Souris, which is very high for the synonymotic potential.
The opportunities are not missing to develop and recombinate these synonymous CoV CoVs, providing the emergency of new more transmissible and/or dead people in the future.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unusing contacts between human and animals.
In the case of MISE, MERS and COVID-19, it should be established a better preparation and intervention plan.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is a opportunity for accounting.
Although the smooth shoes have many characteristics favorable to the diffusion of virus, the probability for the man to be in contact with the shoes and other wild species can be minimized if persons are sensitive to the need to be held at the excursion.
A continued monitoring of mammifers is necessary to better understand the CoV and their natural hosts, which will be useful in the prevention of transmission of animals to human and future epidemies.
In order to conclude, the most effective means for the man to prevent viral synoposes is to keep away from the ecological weaknesses of the natural soldiers of synoposes.
We are not yet known all the secrets of the synonymotic origin of the SRAS-CoV-2.
First, if SAS-CoV-2 parent virus is transmitted to pools, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances the shirts and the balls could share the same ecological skin.
Secondly, if the shirts play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with shirts.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer plays the role of real intermediary host, he remains to explain how he interacts with different species, including men, shoes and hairs.
Finally, since many mammifers, including household animals, are subject to contracting SARS-CoV-2, should be processed once at a monitoring and experimental pollution.
Whatever it is a chew-souris, a pool or a other mammifer should be identified by SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical parents who are observed in their natural hosts.
Researchs to come in this area will enhance the development trajector of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important impacts on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The update of the diagnostic criteria of the "subsequent cases" and the "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a fast recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new infection in coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this Directive described our experience and provided references to combating this pandemia at global level.
However, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is recently, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually on the basis of the results of current studies and the experience of the clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategy are also updated.
In this e-mail, we replied to a comment on our directives and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "submitted case" and a "confirmed case" according to the last Diagnostic and Treatment Directives of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Commission of the Health of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemia that now is officially carried out the name of the disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called a huge respiratory syndrome for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WTO qualified the COVID-19 pandemia.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2, our team has made a fast recommendation that has been published online on military medical search on 06 February 2020.
She had a lot of attention since her publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge progress hardly on the basis of the results of current studies and the experience of the clinical practice; therefore the diagnostic and treatment strategy are constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Directives of COVID-19 published by the National Commission of Health of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have known seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, which have been modified by some contexts.
Our Directive having received a comment from Zhou and al., these recently presented a simple evaluation proposal on the basis of their clinical experience.
Their works have brought new evidence for our Directive and are also a precious reference for this world pandemia.
We appreciate their important work and thank them.
However, their work should also be updated according to the last diagnostic and treatment of COVID-19 (seven version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edit (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a subsequent case must associate one of the characteristics of the epidemological antengents with two elements of clinical demonstrations to constitute a complete analysis, or should correspond to three elements of clinical demonstrations in the absence of clear epidemological anticipations:
Epidemiological adventures: (1) an antidepartment of traveling or residence in the city of Wuhan and in the neighbouring areas or in other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (2) a contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids); (3) a contact with patients who have been presented from the fifth or symptoms of the city of Wuhan or other communities where the COVID-19 cases were signed in the last 14 days before the range of offices); (3) an annual range of officers (inclusive cases) in the fields of fields (including the fields of fields) (including the range of fields of fields) (including in the ranges of ranges, 2 and 2 in the range of range of ranges).
Clinical manifestations: (1) favour and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) images presenting the characteristics of infection in COVID-19; (3) total number of white balls indicating a normal, reduced or reduced lymphocytes since symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be subject to any item of pathologic or serological evidence: (1) Really positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the total viral genome presenting strong homogeneity with the new coronavirus; (3) positive tests for the anticorps IgM and IG of SARS-CoV-2; or amending the specific anticorps IgG of the SARS-CoV-2, which passes to positive or advancement of the ≥ 4 times in the recurrence of the phase report of the phase.
We can state that the PCR test in real time of nuclear acids in respiratory paths or in blood preliminaries has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic depth was added to the fourth edit (27 January 2020) and to the Fifth Edition (8 February 2020); then the series test was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments are maintained on the continued work of researchers to find a optimal kit of detection of nuclear acids for a fast diagnostic, and the scale of respiratory paths included blood preliminary, with increased accessibility of various specific specimens, and contributed to the adding of the positive result of the specific anticorps in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, more evidence are reminded of us about atypic symptomic patients and asymptomatics patients.
Thus, the graphical representation of Zhou and al. should be updated because they classified persons who did not present clinical symptoms as “low risk. ”
The evaluation system should also be checked in the clinical practice and in future studys.
In order to conclude, we will hope the energy of more direct evidence and we will ask the readers to transmit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of the “suspects” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest them to follow and respect the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in order to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths linked to COVID-19, a journal record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths linked to COVID-19 in one day.
The country also records a registration of mortality due to virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemology, surveys and research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of registred persons included 114 cases and 33 healthy persons, which remained limited to home.
A total of 17 deaths has been recorded.
The closement of public transports began on 26 March and had to end the Sunday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medical, carburant and food) was always authorised.
On March 19, these three were already restored.
Jeudi, the total number of infections by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has over the million in the world, according to the data of the University of Johns Hopkins.
In the world, the countries have announced more strictly measures to prevent the propagation of the disease.
Jeudi, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's master, has prolonged the end of the city until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted the prolongation of the national urgency state of 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favor, ten absences and a vote against.
Human coronavirus synototic origins
The epidemies of severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) have inverted the tendency to demonstrate what point an infection in HCOV could be devaist and potentially mortal.
The majority of HCOVs comes to the rooms that they are not pathogenes.
The intermediary hosts of certain HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct impacts in the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV-home interactions in animals may also allow the CoV in humans to understand better.
According to the differences of proteinal sequences, CoV is classified in four kinds (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The type of Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCOV and is divided in four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence have shown that the hair-souris and ringers play the genetic source role for the majority of the alpha-coV and the CoV beasts, while the birds are the main rescue of gamma-coV and delta-CoV.
At this day, seven human coV (HCOV) are known.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-coV.
The five other Beta-CoV include the HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-CoV) and the SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of synonymous origins of HCOV offers a framework that allows to understand natural history, motival forces and restrictive factors of the barrier of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search of the host(s) to reserve, intermediary and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important impacts in the future accounting prevention.
Animal CoVs are known since the end of the 1930s.
During the last decades, seven HCOV were identified.
The first sugar of HCOV-229E was isolated in the respiratory paths of patients who presented higher respiratory paths in 1966, and then adjusted to grow in polmon cell lines WI-38.
The patients infected by HCOV-229E were present symptoms of the classic rhume, including heads, extinctions, diseases and gorge, with fiber and towels observed in 10 to 20% of the cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both parts of the world and seems to be essentially transformed into the temperature climate countries.
Australia's stores reduce the quantities of toiled toiled by accumulated paper
Wednesday and Sunday evening, the Australian Masters Woolworths and Coles have reduced their restrictions of toilette to two and a package by achat in all national stores, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits have been displayed as a form of messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the strings.
The purchasers appeared to be reserved by fear of COVID-19 and the need to be stricted.
Mercredi, Woolworths also restricted toilt paper accompanies for home deliverys to a package by command.
These measures have followed the previous restriction of four packages by accusation introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press-communication of 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, “a lot of stores are still in stocks in the time following the delivery” and qualified the request of "unprecedent", while ALDI, in a publication on the Facebook March, was called "expected".
The winds have known a strong increase in the last week, according to a Woolworth's port-word.
The magazine Costco in Canberra also restricted the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the penalty, Coles ordered greater packages to the providers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered a additional storage, while ALDI has set up more loads for a mercredi proposed promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Detailers, stated that detailers try to increase the stocks, but that the restrictions of the local advice on the time of training training are difficult.
It provides a higher production cost, while the providers try to respond to the request, and less promotions.
Mardi, ALDI announced that after the anti-lock of stocks, some magazines are not able to honor the promotion of the mercredi.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert of the distribution sector of the Technology University of Queensland, explained that the magazines reapprov the stocks every night.
He has noted that the toilette paper is a volumed article, leading stocks of a reduced quantity that, once exhausted, leaves great empty spaces in rayons, strengthening the pressure of a penalty.
“ Coles and Woolworths claim that if the rayons are full, if products such as toilt paper roles and desinfects can be [accounted] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce the panic, ” explains Russell Zimmerman in ABC News.
The Recycling Toilette Paper producer Who Gives a Crap declared the last mercredi they were in stock breaking.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilt paper, and Solaris Paper which produces the Sorbent paper, underlined that they work 24/7 to maintain the approval, according to the article of News.com.au.
Domain.com, an immobilier site, indicated that some sellers of immobilier goods offered a toilet toilet to the first income in Melbourne, while less venders were organized by the fact that the purchasers were in conjunction during the long weekend of the Working feast.
The news edit of NT News, a day-day printed in Darwin, included an eight pages in order to be discovered and used as toilet paper.
The magazines were first restricted to impose restrictions, in accordance with a report of 3 March of the ABC Australia, in which they preached that they would not introduce achievement restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, desinfects, sect products, hygiene products for hands and farine.
In addition, outside Australia, it was observed tomorrow evening that the supermarket on the British online Ocado limited the toilette Paper Andres to two 12 roules packages.
The World Health Organization qualifies the COVID-19 pandemia
Mercedes, the World Health Organization (OMS) qualified the current COVID-19 epidemia (the disease provoked by the SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the propagation of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, the OMS has indicated the need to put Governments to the action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemia.
If countries deposit, test, treat, isolation, location and mobilization of their populations in the context of the response," says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO.
“We are strongly concerned, not only by the alarm levels of propagation and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, ancient director of the Centres for the control and prevention of the diseases of the United States, the pandemia is “not previously”.
He declared, in the proposals published by CNN in February, that “no other respiratory virus has been observed from his apparence until its propagation continued to the global scale.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying, “We have never been witnesses of a pandemia provoked by a coronavirus. ”
He added: "and we have never been witnesses of a pandemia that can be dominated at the same time."
The new pandemia states followed by the decision of the WHO in January to declare the epidemia an urgency of international health.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disasters of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said: "To make short, the situation will be emphasized."
Jeudi, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, entering over 4 600 dead.
The coronavirus pandemia of 2019-20 is an epidemia of coronavirus in the course of 2019 (COVID-19), which has been provoked by the serious respiratory syndrome of coronavir 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemia was detected in Wuhan, in China, December 2019, urgent public health declared on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemia on 11 March 2020.
At 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territory, leading about 97 000 dead.
364,000 people are healthy.
The legality rate is estimated to 4% in China, while in the rest of the world, it varies from 13,04% in Algerian to 0,08% in New Zealand.
Current symptoms comprehend fibres, touxs and suffering.
Complications can include the pneumony and the syndrome of alike respiratory depression.
The time between the exposition and the appearance of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can explore between two and four days.
There is no specific vaccin or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is a symptomic and support treatment. The recommended preventive measures include launching their hands, covering the mouth to allocate, staying away from others, and monitoring and finishing the suspected persons to be infected.
The entire world authorities have reacted by setting restrictions on movements, forty-fourths, covers, risk controls on workplaces and staffs.
The pandemia has built severe socio-economic perturbations at the world level, the report or annulation of sportive, religious, political and cultural events, as well as the generalised penalties of panic accompanies.
Schools and universities have closed the national or local scale in 193 countries, taking about 99,4 per cent of the world's student population.
Failure information on the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of Xenophobia and Discrimination have occurred by Chinese, other origin and Asian persons of East and South-East, as well as among other people come from many regions in cases of virus.
Since the reduction of travelways and fermeries in the farmer industry, there has been a reduction of the atmospheric pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei Province) reported a fair case of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the market of large fruits of Huanan, and it is therefore thinking that the virus would be synotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemia was called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus with coronavirus of shoes, the coronavirus of the poolins, and the SARS-CoV. Following, it was discovered that the first known person who had presented symptoms had been disease on 1 December 2019, and this person was not clearly linked with the ultimate feeding of the fresh product market.
On the cases of the first family signed in December 2019, the two thirds had been linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncontrolled report from South China Morning Post would suggest that the first case could be up to 17 November 2019, at a 55-year person of the Province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, UNS signed that, as new cases seemed to reduce in China but soon increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had over the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong sub-valuation of cases, especially among those who presente blessing symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among the young people, the 19 and less representative of 2,4% of the cases in the world. The scientific advice in the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, was considered that 60% of the British population should be infected before they could achieve an effective collective immunity.
The cases designed the number of persons tested in COVID-19 and which the test was confirmed positively in accordance with official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made for official policies to test those who had only becoming blessings, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16, stated that in China, until 23 January, 86% of the non-detected COVID-19 infections were estimated, and that these not registered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
An statistical analysis published on 30 March considered that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases mentioned.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction level (R0) of COVID-19 were 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the Centres for the control and prevention of the diseases of the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the accommodations of COVID-19 guarantees.
For those who do not guarantee, the time between the appearance of symptoms and death is sitting between 6 and 41 days, the currentest is 14 days.
At 10 April 2020, about 97 000 deaths had been impressed in COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were about over 60 years, and 75 per cent of existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official accounts of deaths related to COVID-19 are generally refer to dead persons who have been tested positively in the COVID under official protocols.
The real number of victims of COVID-19 may be greater higher, since it could not include untested persons - e.g. in home, in retreat houses, etc.
Partial data from Italy indicates that the numbers of survival during the pandemia are 4-5 times more than the official detail of COVID's deaths.
A Port-word of the Centres for Control and Prevention of the Diseases of the United States (CDC) recognised "We know that [the number of deaths] is substituted," a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the subvaluation in the United States. This sub-estimation was often produced in pandemies, such as the portional grippe epidemia of H1N1 of 2009. The first death was confirmed in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was achieved on February 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was located in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China continental, more than a dozen of death by countries were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except the Antarctica. Many indicators are shortly used to quantify death.
These numbers are in accordance with the regions and with time, and are affected by the test volume, the quality of health system, the therapeutic options, the time exceeded from the beginning of the epidemia, and the demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed on a given period.
According to the statistics of the University of Johns-Hopkins, the global case report is 6,0% (97 039/1 617 204) at 10 April 2020.
The number is different by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-declined report decreased from 17.3% (for the symptoms appeared between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7 % (for the symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the legalityrate (legality), which represents the percentage of diagnosed persons who succeed to a disease, and the infection rate (infection), which represents the percentage of infections (infections) of contamines (security and non-diagnostics) that have been successful to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of pollution in the term of disease.
Many scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the infection rates for pandemia in its globality are located between 0,1 % and 0,39 %.
The highest value of this fourth is coherent with the results of the first tests randomised for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on the estimates of legality.
The OMS supports that pandemia can be controlled.
The pit and the definitive duration of the epidemia are incertain and can varie through region.
Maciej Boni of the University of Pennsylvania said: "No control, generally infected epidemies are stabilised and then begin to restrict when the disease comes to missing hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant provisions at the time it will happen. ”
The Medical Advisory of the Chinese Government of Zhong Nanshan stated that “the case could be finished from June” if all countries should be mobilised to follow the recommendations of the WTO on the measures to enhance the propagation of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski de la London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.
According to a study of the Emperial College carried out by Neil Ferguson, a physical distance and other measures will be required “ until a vaccin is available (possibly 18 months or more)”.
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt stated: “I think it's impossible that this coronavirus – because he is very easy – totally disappeared ” and that he could “avoid to become saisonnar disease, acceptable to reappear each year. ”
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the width of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms are sometimes not specific and infected persons can be asymptomatic.
The two shortest symptoms are the fever (88%) and the seed tows (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosity), loss of odorate, supply, muscular pains and articulary pains, gorge, cephalates, frissons, smoking, hemoptysie, diarrhee, or cyanose. The OMS states that a person around six is seriously sick and with respiratory difficulties.
The centers for control and prevention of the diseases of the United States (CDC) recommend the urgency symptoms such as a respiratory difficulty, a threatic pain, a sudden confusion, difficult reveals, and the face or the blue lyrics; the immediate medical cares are recommended if these symptoms are present. The final development of the disease can cause a severe penny, a severe respiratory syndrome, a seventh, a chemical and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatical, without any clinical symptom but with results in the test confirming the infection, then researchers have submitted recommendations in which persons who had a close contact with infected persons should be extremely monitored and examined to exceed the risk of infection.
The Chinese assessments of asymptomatics are different from some to 44 %.
The normal incubation period (the period between pollution and the appearance of symptoms) is oscillated between one and 14 days; it is often more than five days. Good example of incertitude, the estimation of the proportion of carried out of the COVID-19 who lost the ocean was initially 30% before to fall to 15 %.
Some information on how the disease continues to determine.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly in a close contact and in a range of steel steels produced in all, external or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a range of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have discovered that alloying without protecting can project bottles at a distance of 4,5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by gouttelet fingers that remain in the air on longer periods, which could be projected in speaking. Respiratory bottles can also be projected when expiration, especially speaking, although the virus is not generally aeroported.
The pools can argue in the mouth or the nest of other persons located near or even be inhabited in the pumons.
Certain medical procedures such as income and reanimation of cardiopulmonary (RCP) may cause respiratory secretions that are pulverized and therefore enforce a air propagation.
He can also spread when someone touchs a wounded surface, especially the hair, before touching his eyes, his neck, or his mouth.
If some fear that he can transmit through the seals, this risk is considered as weak.
The Government of China excluded the possibility of a federal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more critical for the first three days after the beginning of symptoms, but the propagation may be possible before symptoms appear and advanced cities of the disease.
Persons have been tested positively at the disease until three days before the occurrence of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only some asymptomatical cases confirmed in existing laboratory, but the asymptomatic transfer was detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Prevention and Control Centre of Diseases (ECDC) states that if you still don't know exactly with the facility of the disease, one person generally counts two to three others.
Exactly, the virus could be detected at three days on the plastic (polypropylen) and inoxydable acid 304, after one day on the carton, and at four hours on the cooker.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Home animals and other animals have been tested positively at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend to launch their hands after they touched animals, as after they were contacted with other surfaces that infected persons could have been touched.
The auge respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three persons of pneumonia related to the case of aguaine respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronavires appeared in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the mining sample, which disappears its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is extremely connected to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be a synonymous origin.
A genetic analysis declared that the coronavirus is genetically the type of Betacoronavirus, the sub-type Sarbecovirus (line B), associated with two suits of souris.
It is equal to 96% of the genome of another coronavirus shoes (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amid acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between the issus of the poolins and the human issus viruses.
The comparison of the whole genome has shown at this day a maximum of 92 % of common genétic material between the coronavirus of spenolins and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the splinters are the intermediary host.
Infection by virus may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is made by inverse training of the reaction in polymerase (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanning segments.
A study comparing the PCR and scanning to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is most sensitive than the PCR, although less precisely, because many of its image functionalities correspond to other pneumonies and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “the scanner is not used to depress or as test of first intention to diagnose COVID-19”.
The OMS has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first parution on 17 January.
The test uses the inverse transscription of the reaction in line by polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be carried out on respiratory or blood requirements.
The results are generally available in a few hours or days.
Generally this test is conducted on a preliminary rhinopharynx, but we can also use a gorge preliminary. Many laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect anticorps.
On 6 April 2020, no one of them had been revealed enough to be approved for a generalized use.
In the United States, a series of tests developed by Cellex was approved to use urgency by only certificated laboratories.
The characteristics of the radiographs and the tomodensiometry (scan) of persons who presente symptoms include opacity in axistic disposal and a non-function of flourish expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently a international online database of image results of cases confirmed.
Because of recovery with other infections such as adenovirus, the image without confirmation by PCR is a limited precision to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of the TCR scanners and demonstrated that if the image is less precise for infection, it is faster and sensitive, and it is considered that it was taken as a depth tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutive neurones networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the image once on radiographies and scanners.
The prevention strategys of the prevention of the disease are globally understanding having a good personal hygiene, launching their hands, refusing to touch the eyes, the neighbor or the mouth with non-lake hands, and to blow up or exit in a mushroom and throw the mushroom directly into a pool sack.
It was recommended to those who had already been condemned to carry a chirurgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures were also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have prohibited or declared all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors touched by the epidemia.
However, the virus has achieved the stage of Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is expanded in communities, and some of these communities do not know where or how they have been condemned. It is recommended to health professionals who are concerned by someone who could be infected to take normal precautions and contact precautions, and to carry out contacts. The search of contacts is an important method to determine the source of infection and future transmissions.
The use of localisation of phones by governments in this regard has taken confidentiality problems, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communicated community calling to attach limits to this type of monitoring.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of the volunteer, and in account of 7 April 2020, more than twelve expert groups worked on private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the existence of a user at nearby other portable phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been contacted with someone who has been tested positively at COVID-19. Fake ideas are currently running on the way to prevent infection; for example, wear the nit and gargary with the mouth bathroom is not efficient.
There is no vaccin against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently encouraged to develop one.
It is recommended to lay his hands to stop the propagation of the disease.
The CDC recommends people to lay their hands often to the cycle and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they were in the towels or when the hands are visiblely sales; before eating; and after they moved, they were cut off, or forever.
That's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the weaknesses, who breaks his protective envelope.
The CDC recommended also to use a desinfect for alcohol hands containing a volume of at least 60 % of alcohol when knowledge and water are not easy to access.
The OMS recommends people to refuse to touch the eyes, the neck, or the mouth with non-lake hands.
The surfaces can be decounted in several ways (in a minute of exposition to the desinfecting for an inoxydable surface), including the ethanol to 62 to 71 %, of isopropanol to 50 to 100 %, of sodium hypochloride of 0,1 %, of hydrogenyde to 0,5 %, and of the povidine of 0,2 to 7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium clone and chlorhexin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a establishment such as a office building or a cross, all rooms such as offices, toilets, joint salts, as well as tablets, tablets, keyboards, telecommands, and automatic distributors used by disease persons are defected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and their necks with their steel or a smoke when they are all or extermined, and to throw every smoke immediately.
The chirurgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because masks can limit the volume and distance passed by the pools projected by speaking, foreign and all.
The OMS has ejected instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist to the University of Leeds, “Bring a mask can reduce the propension of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of the hands.” The use of the masks is also recognized to those who are occupied by a potential person of the disease.
The OMS recommended the mask port to people in health only if they face a significant risk, for example, if they take a disease from COVID-19, even if she recognizes that the mask port can help people not touch their face.
Many countries have started encouraged their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the non-medical mask port in tissu.Chinese recommended specifically the use of medical masks for health, especially in the case of nearby (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other persons.
Hong Kong recommends to carry a chirurgical mask in public transports or good places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to build facial masks home and to clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited public sorties without mask or other way to cover his neck and his mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam set the mask port to everyone in public places, so that everyone protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian Government ordered that everybody enters into a supermarket has a mask.
Israel asked all his residents to take a public mask.
Taiwan, who produced ten million masks a day since the middle Mars, set the mask port to trains and interurban buss on April 1 April.
Panama has committed the port of a mask for any exit, although recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who can't buy it.
Masks were also used largely in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
The social distance (also called physical distance) includes control measures for infections destined to reduce the propagation of the disease by reducing contacts between people.
The methods include the 40th, the restrictions of traveling and the closement of schools, workplaces, towns, theaters and trade centres.
You can apply the methods of social distance by staying home, limiting their travels, exiting people, saluting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments urge or recommend social distances in the regions touched by the epidemia.
The maximum width of the collections recommended by the Government and Health Agencies of the United States was quickly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany bailed public collections of more than two persons. The elderly adults and the age of the health problems such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension or immunitary systems have been invited to remain in the house as possible in the areas touched by the epidemia. At the end of March 2020, the OMS and other health organisms have replaced the term "social distancy" by means of physical distancy.
The use of the term "social distance" was to believe that it had to be a total social isolation, instead of encourageing people to keep contact with other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to follow during the pandemia.
They understood the recommendation to have sexual reports only with a person with which we live, which does not have the virus or does not present the symptoms.
The home isolation was recommended for the positive diagnosed persons in COVID-19 and those who think to be infected.
Health organisations have exceeded detailed instructions for a correct isolation. Many governments have established or recommended the implementation in 40 individuals for all populations living in the areas affected.
Instructions for 40-year-old individuals were given to the most risked groups.
Persons who have been exposed to an accommodation from COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very important to be placed in 40 days for 14 days since they could be exposed for the last time.
A epidemic control strategy is the end or elimination, and the attention.
The entity is established during the first phase of epidemia and is to follow and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infections and vaccination control measures to prevent the propagation of the disease in the rest of the population.
When there is no more possible to prevent the propagation of the disease, efforts are turned to the attention phase: measures to raise this propagation and enhance its effects on health care and society.
Finance and attention measures may be taken at the same time.
The required elimination of extreme measures to influence the pandemia by reducing the number of basic reproduction at least 1 is a part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic epidemic epidemic epidemic: it is called to apply the epidemic core.
This allows to reduce the risk of a supercharge of health services and to win time for the development of vaccins and treatment.
Without non-parmaceutical interventions, the epidemia can handle personal prevention measures, such as hands, masker port and 40 individuals; public measures of social distance such as the closement of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encouraging the acceptance of such interventions and participation to them, as well as environmental actions such as the cleaning of surface. More drastical measures were taken to julgage thepidemie in China when the graveness of this is appeared, as the fourth-termic cities and a strict training.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures to limit the propagation of the virus.
The South Korea introduced the mass depth and the ships in 40 localized, and emited warnings on infected people's movements.
Singapur has provided a financial support for infected persons who have been infringed in 40th, and has affected worms to those who have not done it.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctified medical supplies. Simulations for the British and the United States show that the attention (relamentally but not the elimination of epidemia propagation) and the elimination (reverse epidemia development) are faced to important disagreements.
Optical attention policies can reduce health care requirements of 2/3 and half deaths, but can not lose hundreds of thousands of dead, and health care systems are submitted.
The expression may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulated in the human population (or until a vaccin is available, if it happens first), because in other cases, the transfer is rapidly rebound when the measures are delayed.
The long-term intervention to eliminate pandemia has a social and economic cost.
There are no antiviral treatment approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are currently, including existing treatment tests.
The takeing of medicines without order against the rhume or the consumption of drinks and the relax can contribute to supply symptoms.
According to gravity, oxygennotherapy, intravenous perfusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can gain results.
Many components that have already been approved for treatment of other viral diseases are currently in the study of COVID-19.
The OMS stated that some “traditional and artisanal medium” may apply the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase of capacity and adjustment of health care for the needs of patients in the COVID-19 is described by the OMS as a basic response to the epidemia.
The ECDC and the Regional Office of the OMS for Europe have published guidelines on the attention of hospitals and primary health care services for re-deployment of resources at various levels, in particular consisting laboratory services to COVID-19 test tests, and annexing non-urgent interventions when possible, separating and isolating patients tested in COVID-19, and strengthening the capacity of intensive sustainability by the training of personal and increased number of ventilators and available liabilities.
There are various theories relating to the original location of the first case (note zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could be raised up to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan in the Province of Hubei in China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market of large fruits of Huanan, which also sold living animals. According to one of these animals, the virus would come from one of these animals; otherwise, it would have a synotic origin. An unknown phenomenony of cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the hospital of Hubei, which reported the CDC of Whan Jihanan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central hospital of Wuhan warned their colleagues from a “Cronavirus similar to the SRAS”.

Since the COVID-19 epidemia, a recruitment of prejudicial, xenophobia and racism has been confronted to Chinese origin and is Asian persons, and against people who have sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspition and hospitality have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and in Asia.
Reports from February (e.g. that most cases were still limited to China) described racistic feelings expressed in various groups throughout the world according to which the Chinese merited the virus or received a justified chastisement.
Some African countries also have increased anti-chinois feelings.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei have reported a discrimination on their regional origin.
The support was brought to Chinese, which is online or outline, and in the areas touched by the virus.
Following the progress of the epidemia to new sensitive countries, the Italians, inhabitants of the first European countries to get a serious COVID-19, could also face the suspicion and the Xenophobia. The citizens of the country such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapur and South Korea are in a first signed time in order to interfere to China to enter their countries to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan made anger on Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asians who live in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported a increase in the levels of racism insultes and agressive.

The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consul in Kolkata, who qualifies them of “false”. In China, the Xenophobia and the racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were attacked by the pandemia, and strangers were described as“ strangers deceits ” that he should“ remove. ”
A number of journals to be paid by paying them for any or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have set their scientific articles in connection with free access epidemia.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory depth of the respiratory disease in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the methods of detection of virus and detection of anticorps produced in the infection.
The presence of virus in the scenarios is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detectes the ARN of coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus ARN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of anticorps (serology) can be used once for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Anticorps tests reveals how many people have contracted the disease, including persons whose symptoms were too easier to be stated or asymptomatical persons.
A exact death level of disease and collective immunity level among the population may be determined from the results of this test.
Since a limited disappointment, no country had a confidential data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of his population, and there were important differences on the number of tests in each country.
It is likely that this variability affects significantly the indicated legality levels, which risks to be considerablely surprised in some countries.
With the inverse transscription followed by a real-time polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory examples obtained by various methods, including the nasofarrying school or the exectoration style.
The results are generally available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR tested from pharing schools is only trusted during the first week of the disease.
Afterward, the virus can disappear from the gorge while he continues to multiply in the pumons.
In the case of infected persons tested during the second week, an exhibition can also be prevented in deep respiratory paths by aspiration category, or a crachat (expectation) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 by using an inverse transscription followed by a real-time policy reaction (rRT-PCR), and constituted the base of 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean society Kogenebiotech developed a SAS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He detected the "E" gene of all coronavirus beasts, and the RdRp-specific genne in SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first company to receive the use of urgency of the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a kit of detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR.A United States, the Centres for Control and Prevention of Disease Control and Prevention (Center for Disaase Control and Prevention) distributing their provisions for agencies by the new Coronavirus 2019-20CoV in the public workshop of the Research Resource.
In the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test on three was obtained unfinancial results due to defective reactions and a foreign golf of tests in Atlanta. In fact, a average of less than 100 examples per day has been treated successfully during February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered as faithful until 28 February 2020, and at the moment the federal and local labs received the authorisation to start the depth.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in accordance with the authorisation of urgency use.The trade laboratories in the United States have started the depth at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national test scale of COVID-19 based on the RT-PCR.
This diagnosis also distributed tests of COVID-19 to national scale on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits have been announced. The collection and treatment of scales must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test in COVID-19.In March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnosics received the authorisation of the FDA for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3,5 hours, and allowing a device conducted at about 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA provided an authorisation of urgency (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the m2000 system of Abbott. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received a United States from the FDA for a test at about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses the isotherme of nuclear axis instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott requires to intensify the manufacturer to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal anticorps that is specifically linked to the protein of the nucleocapside (proteine N) of the new coronavirus in Taiwan, in the hope that he can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a fast test of the grip.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “polar radiographies present a low diagnostic value to the first towns, while the results of the TDM [tomodensiometry] can be concluded even the appearance of symptoms. ”
A number of typical symptoms on the TDM are opacity with multi-lobable multi-lob-depolis with a device distribution, asymetric and postery.
A subpleural predominance, a crazy paving and a consolidation are developed as long as the disease is developed.
A study comparing the PCR to the TDM in Wuhan, on the original point of the current pandemia, suggested that the TDM is most sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, many of its image results are consistent with other pneumonies and disease.
In March 2020, the American Radio College recommends that “TDM does not be used for the depth or as a test of the first line to diagnose COVID-19." In March 2020, CDC recommends the PCR for the initial depth.
The production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG, is part of immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in persons from about 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and in the frame of the monitoring of the population.The tests can be completed in central labs (TLC) or by testing at the head of the patient (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated systems at high level of many clinical labs can be able to realize these analysis, but their disponibility will depend on the production level of each system.
For the TLC, a single device blood can be used usually, although series can be used to follow immunitary response.
For the PoCT, a single blood cancer is generally prevented by cutaned pounds.
In the differences of PCR methods, no extraction step is required before analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that should be informed by the Agency and that, therefore, can distribute their anticorps tests.
On 7 April 2020, a only test was approved by the FDA in accordance with urgency use.Fin March 2020, Euroimmund Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, can detect the IgG and IgA anticorps against virus in blood scales.
The depth capacity is a number of hundreds of examples in several hours, which is very faster than the PCR test of the viral ARN.
The antibodies are generally detected 14 days after the start of infection.In April, the United Kingdom stated that no test kits to the anticorps purchased by the country was sufficiently performed to be used.
Hong Kong has set a plan in the frame of which the suspects can stay inside them, “the service of urgents will provide the patient a similar tube”, patients crashed inside, sent it and then received the result of the test.The British NHS announced that it brings a pilot project to test the suspect cases, which eliminates the risk that a patient does not infect others infecting in a hospital or the need to defect a case in case.Directs of the COV-19 test driver falls for a high-specific health professional inspection.
In Germany, the National Association of the Medicines of Affairs of Affairs in Germany, the South Korea has permitted to realize one of the fastest and exhaustive depths in the world. In Germany, the National Association of the Medicines of Prosecutive Affairs declared on 2 March that she had the ability to realize some 12,000 tests per day in a ambulance environment, and that 10 700 patients were tested during the past week.
The costs are supported by the insurance of disease when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive tests were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown because only positive results are stated.
A first laboratory studio was revealed that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of 483 295 estimates were tested until the week 12/2020, and that 33 491 estimates (6,9 %) have received a positive result for the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Technion and the hospital Rambam have developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients at the time, in order to regulate the scenarios and proceeding that the review was positive. In Israel, a laboratory studies of the Technology and the hospital Rambam had developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients at the time, in order to replace the review of the SAS-CoV-2. In Israel, a researchery of the hospital and the hospital Rambam had been tested and tested a method of rate of 64 patients once, in order to the 100,000 febrush of the January of the January of 2020, in the January, by the January, the January of the January, the 64, by the January of the year of the January of the January 20, the January, the January, the January of the January of the year of the year of the year of the year.
With its construction in 5 days overviewed by Wang Jian, the BGI funder, the modelization stated that the cases in the province of Hubei would be 47% higher and that the cost corresponding to the implementation in 40 were duplicated without this depth capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratorys in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities totally.
On 4 March 2020, the total journal capacity was up to 50 000 tests per day.The multiple models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1 122 patient examples by using only 93 tests. These equilibrate models can be executed in small robots without liquid manipulator.
In March, the penalties and the insufficient quantities of reaction have become a foreign gull for the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has forced some authors to examine the preparation protocols for the preparation of the scales involved in 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free the ARN genes to continue the disappointment.In March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now testing the largest part of its population by the Coronavirus, and they were able to intensify the disaster for the majority of the population.
These results were obtained by a combination of the ability to carry up drive tests and to achieve a high-debted laboratory at the scale of the population at Group 42 and BGI (based on their urgency detection laboratories " Huo-Yan" in China).
Constructed in 14 days, the laboratory is able to take tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operated outside China.
Different test formulas of various parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low income countries without the necessary resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The Protocol developed by the Centres for the control of the diseases of the United States was published only on 28 January, while reaching the disponibility of tests in the United States.The Chinese and the United States had problems on the level of the freedom of test kits at the beginning of the epidemia, and those countries, and Australia, could not provide enough kits to respond to the request and recommendations for the health specialists.
In addition, specialists indicate that the great disponibility of tests in South Korea has contributed to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The depth capacity, in large part in the private sector laboratorys, has been strengthened for several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of the depth programmes as a better way to raise the advance of COVID-19.The strong test request due to the wide diffusion of virus has provoked the retard of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private labs of the United States, and the reserves of evacuation and chemical reactions have been exposed.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the faithfulness of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "failure". The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that obtained private tests.Spain buyed test kits at the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Bioeasy Cotechnology Ltd, but the results were not trusted.
The company explained that wrong results could be linked to the incapacity of collecting examples or to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that he would remove the kits that gave wrong results, and replace them by another test kit offered by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovaquia purchased them to China 1,2 million test kits that were discovered failure.
The first Ministry Matovič suggested them to throw them into Denmark. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Turkish Health stated that the test kits that Turkish purchased in China had a "hearted error rate" and that she didn't use them. The United Kingdom buyed 3,5 million test kits in China, but announced at the beginning of April 2020 that they were inutilizable.
The depth, followed by the four hundreds of those who receive positive results and training of persons who have been contacted with the SARS-CoV-2 portors, have given positive results.
The researchers worked in the Italian city of Vo, the place of the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, sent two series of tests at the total of the population around 3 400 people, about 10 days of interval.
Before half of people who had a positive result, they had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were made in 40.
With the restriction of movements in the common, this measure has completely removed new infections.
With a aggressive training of contacts, the restrictions of incoming journeys, the depth and the 40th, the coronavirus pandemia of 2020 to Singapore has progressed quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the closement of restaurants and sale facilities.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapur began to advise residents to stay with them on 28 March, but schools have broken at the end of the vacances on 23 March.
Many other countries also have supported the pandemia through agressive training of contacts, restrictions of incoming travels, disappointment and implementation in 40 countries, but with less agressive borders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has discovered that the countries who have completed most tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have a lower rate of legality, probably because these countries are more approved to detect people who are only smaller symptoms or no symptoms.
The WTO recommends that countries without analysis capacity and where national laboratorys have only a limited experience of COVID-19 to send their five first positive examples and ten first negative examples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 reference laboratories of the OMS to perform confirmation tests.
Among 16 reference labs, 7 is located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of tests" column depends on the national depth policy.
A country who tests only the hospital's admitted persons will have a positive value in percent of higher tests than a country that tests all citizens, which are present or not symptoms, other factors who are the same.
The lavage of hands, also called hygiene of hands, corresponds to cleaning the hands in order to remove sales, grass, microorganisms or other independeble substances.
The fact that systematically lay hands with wisdom to some "key moments" of the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, for example diarrhee and colera, which are transmitted by gold-fecale way.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grip or rhume, for example, without laying the hands before touching the eyes, the neck or the mouth (e.g. the mukes).
It is important to lay his hands on the ice at five key moments of the day: before and after the defeation, after cleaning the feet of a baby or changed his beds, before eating a child, before and before and after preparing food or manipulated of flesh, fish, or crucial eggs.
If you don't have water or knowledge under the hand, you can lay your hands on the scene. The World Health Organization recommends to lay your hands:
before, during and after preparation of foods;
before and after being occupied by a sick person;
after having changed the layers of a baby or cleaned a child who is gone to the towels;
after being moved or involving/external;
after touching a animal, food for animals or animal origin;
The hygiene of medical mains refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The fact that the hands are laid before administrating medicines or administering medical care can prevent or reduce the propagation of diseases.
The main medical objective of the lavage of hands is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacterias, viruses or other microorganisms that are subject to disease) and chemical products, which can be nocifed or caused by disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical area, but also for the great public.
The lavage of the hands has many benefits for health, including reduction of the propagation of grip, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infected diarrhee causes; reduction of respiratory infections;
as well as reduction of child mortality rate in home-building.
According to a study achieved in 2013, the improvement of the practices relating to the hygiene of the hands could be lowly improved by children's growth less than five years.
In developing countries, children's deathrates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhee can be reduced by introducing simple manual changes, such as the lavage of hands to science.
This simply practice can reduce the deadity level related to these diseases of about 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote the lavage of hands could be reduced by a third part of the diarrhee episodes, a comparable number to that obtained by applying potable waters to low income regions.
Laying the hands to the science allows to reduce 48% diarrhee episodes and become the most effective and the less cost of preventing the diarrhee and similar respiratory infections (IRA). It is a act that should automatically be done in families, schools and communities in the world.
Pneumony, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of death in children at less than five years, which makes about 1,8 million victims per year.
Join, the diarrhee and the pneumony train the death of about 3,5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the fact that it takes the way to lay hands with wisdom before eating and after being gone to the toilets can save more lives than any vaccin or medical intervention, and reduce nearly half of the deaths of the diarrhee and a fourth of the deaths imputable to the aggressive respiratory infections.
The lavage of hands is generally associated with other health measures in the framework of water, assault and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The lavage of the hands also protects the impety, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Effect delegate, the lavage frequency of the hands can smooth the hair by providing a quoted desequence.
A Danish study of 2012 declared that the excessive lavage of the hands could lead from the eczyme or a dermatite at the hands level, characterized by a smoke and demeaners, and particularly frequently in health workers.
The lavage is also considered as one of the symptoms of the complicative obsessional difficulty (TOC).
It is important to lay the hands on the cycle at five key moments of the day to reduce the gold-feal transmission of the diseases: before and after using tolets (mixation, defection), after cleaning the feet of a baby (or changed his beds), before eating a child, before and after and after prepared food or manipulated of flesh, fish or crush flow.
It is also necessary to lay up the hands correctly to prevent the transfer of diseases, in particular before and after having suffered a curse or a worm, after extinction, allocated or moving, after touching animals or manipulated animals and after touching orders.
In many countries, the purchase of hands to the saving is low.
According to a study held in 2015 at 54 countries and carried on the hand higiene, 38.7 per cent of the middle hands was laid down with the sauce. An estimated study in 2014 showed that it was the highest rate in Saudi Arabia (97 per cent), the United States were in the middle of the table (77 per cent) and China showed the lowest rate (23 per cent). There are today several methods to develop communities and democratic use for the manufacture of the day.
For example, the Philippines Education Ministry has implemented a “primary health care programme” in order to promote health and education of children.
The deparation twice per year, associated with the lavage of the hands to the savour and the daily browsing of the dents with a fluored dentification, is in the heart of this national programme.
It was also achieved with success in Indonesia.
In order to improve the microorganisms present on the ground, it must be added to scientists or detergents to water.
The main action of knowledge and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not a efficient cleaning for the pool because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the earth, are hardly solved in the water.
A adequate water debt, however, facilitate the cleaning.
The solid knowledge, because of its re-usable nature, can cover battery issues of previous use.
A small number of studies carried out on the transfer of bacteria from a solid contemporary savon have concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacterias were broken with the museum.
The Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) also indicates that “auto-distributors of liquid knowledge are preferable”.
Antibacterian sciences have been strongly recommended to the comprehensive persons of their health situation.
In this day there is no evidence suggesting that the use of antiseptics or the recommended desinfects allows to object the organisms resident to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterian sciences contain current antibacterian agents such as triclosan, in which many remaining organisms.
Therefore, even though the summers resistant to antibiotics are not the fruit of antibacterian sciences, these lasts could not be effective as well as announced.
Further than the tensioactive and protector of the pool, the most complex forms can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), served to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with an antimicrobian function, and other protein agents (also true, vitamines, mental, extracts).A rich analyze of the public health school of Oregon’s University indicated that the ordinary assess were also effective as the anti-bactors of the individuals who contain the individuals and striking, to prevent and elimiter their handmaids.
The hot water used to lay the hands is not enough hot to kill the batteries.
Bacterias are very faster than the temperature of the body (37 °C).
However, the teeth and saving water is more efficient than the fresh and saving water to eliminate natural oils of sale and bacteria.
However, in contrast to the popular believe, scientists declared that the use of teeth water would not contribute to reduce the microbian load on the hands.
A desinfect or an antiseptic for the hands is an hygiene product of non-show hands.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the XXIee century, the non-alcool manual hygiene products (including hydroalcool solutions, antiseptical solutions for hands or desinfects for hands) began to be popular.
Most of them are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with an extraordinary agent such as the carbomer (acrilic polymer) to obtain a yellow, or to a humeting such as glycerine to get a liquid or museum for a larger use facility and reduce the effect that is safe of the alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen massyde increases antimicrobian activity.The desinfects for hands containing at least 60 to 95 % of alcohol are effectively exciting grapes.
Hydroalcool solutions kill bacterias, multiresisting bacterias (SARM and ERV), tuberculose and certain viruses (with HH, herpes, VRS, Rhinovirus, vaccin, grip and hepatitis), and campaigns.
Hydroalcool solutions containing 70 % of alcohol exhausted 99,97 % (reducation of 3,5, equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the batteries presented on 30 seconds after appliance and 99,99% to 99,999 % (reducation of 4 to 5 logs) of the batteries presented on the hands of 1 minute after appliance.Desinfects for hands are more effective against batteries and less effective against certain viruss.
Hydroalcool solutions are almost ineffectively against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenergy.A sufficient quantity of desinfecting for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used to be used to well move or cover both hands.
It must be limited to the pawn and the dose of the two hands, and the interstices between the hair and the hair for 30 seconds, until the liquid, the museum or the egg is seen.
The American Centre for control and prevention of diseases recommends the lavage of hands instead of the use of hydro-cool solutions, especially when the hands are visiblely sales.
The increased use of these products is provided for their use facility and their rapid elimination activities of microorganisms; however, they should not replace a right hand lavage as if you have no water and they have hands.
The frequency of hydroalcoolical solutions may lead to a quoted sequence if the formula is not strengthened by emotions and/or hydratic agents.
The insurance effect of the alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glucerine and/or other emoticons to the formula.
In the context of clinical tests, hydroalcool solutions containing emolydients have provoked just less exciting and cutaneous security than we know or detergent antimicrobians.
The allergic contact dermatite, contact urticary or hypersensitivity for alcohol or additional in hydro-alcool solutions are weird.
The fact that hydro-cool solutions have less tendency to provoke irriting contacts has made them more attractive than the lavage of hands on water and science.
Despite their efficiency, non-contained products do not exceed the organic materials presented on the hands, but do not only desinfect them.
That is why the desinfects for the hands are not so efficient as the knowledge and the water to avoid propagation of many pathogen agents, since these last remains on their hands.
The efficiency of desinfects for alcohol hands depends strongly on ingrédients and formula, and has always been lower than the alcohol and desinfects based on alcohol.
More recently, the forms used by benzalconium chlorure have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobian activity after the application, in the differences of the alcohol, which the effectiveness has been attained after repeated use, probably due to indesiderable progressive quantitative reactions.
In lower income populations, many are those who don't have the methods of buying the savour, and they use more than the scenario or the earth.
The skin or earth can be more efficient than the only water, but less than they know it.
Who more is, if the earth or scenario is contaminated by microorganisms, it is risked to increase the propagation of diseases instead of raining it.
Instead of the science, the scene is also a desinfect agent because, in contact with water, it forms a alcalin solution.
The OMS recommends the scene or sable as alternative to the science when it is not available.
The American Centre for control and prevention of disease recommends to launch the hands correctly to prevent transmission of diseases, following the following steps:
Moving your hands with the current teeth or frog water.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of water-based water points, while the water temperature does not seem to be different.
Moving a generous quantity of knowledge on the hands by smoking one against another, without forgetting the dose of the hands, between the hairs and the rings.
The science removes the grass of the hair, and studies indicate that people are trying to launch their hands more seriously when they use knowledge than with water only.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
Action to smooth creation from the friction, which helps to eliminate the grass of the skin, and to smooth more time to get away more than the smokes.
Run up goodly to the current water.
The smoking in a stagnant water bathroom can lead to the retamination of the hands.
Security with a own or free air service.
Moiled and humid hands are more easier to recognize.The most frequently forgotten areas are the pound, the pound, the spaces between the hair and the bottom of the bottoms.
artificial skins and branchs to scale branches can be able to gain microorganisms.
A hydrated location is often recommended to refuse to have seed hands; the cutaned security favorises the appearance of quoted lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to launch their hands when the rocket and/or knowledge is not available. For example, to cooling water from a bidon or a sustained and performed hot and/or to use the skin if necessary, in developing countries.In the situations where water advance is limited (as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economise the water, such as “type-taps” and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses an suspended cross using a corner, and a pedal that allows you to give a small quantity of water on the hands and a science bread.
The efficiency of the hands is a essential part of the manual hygiene process, but the best way to settle the hands in public tours is discussed.
Moreover, more research suggests that paper services are more hygiene than electric seeds than often found in the toilets.
In 2008, the European Tissue Symposium was carried out by Westminster University in London to compare the levels of higiene offered by paper services, hot-times and more modern air-times.
After the lavage and swallowing hands to the hot-term air, it was declared that the total number of bacteria increased in average of 194% on the bottoms and 254% on the pawls.
The shopping at the age-day shoes had an average increase of the total number of bacterias on the pool of 42 % and on 15 % paths.
After the lavage and shopping of hands with a paper service, the total number of bacterias was reduced from 76% in average on the pool of the dogs and to 77% on the paws. The scientists also carried tests to determine whether there was a cross-creased contamination potential with other users of tickets and the environment of tuckets in accordance with each security method.
The aeroplane seed, which suffers from the air out of the camera to speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to eject the hands and device microorganisms and count eventually from other tolet users and the environment of tolets in a perimeter to 2 meters.
The use of a fast-term air sequence allows microorganisms to divorce a maximum distance of 0,25 meters of the sequence.
Paper services declared that there was no significant propagation of microorganisms. In 2005, in a TÜV Product and Environment, various hand-sharing methods were evaluated.
After the shopping of the hands, the following variables of the bacteria number were observed:
There are many different sequence-main manufacturers, and the seeds were compared to the switch using paper service.
The lavage of hands with desinfecting lenettes is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of science and water.
Hydroalcool solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of medical hands has become obligatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semelweis has discovered its efficiency (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that exhibit reminders when the hospital personnel forget to lay his hands.
A study declared that their use had a reduction of infections.
The medical lavage of the hands must lead at least 15 seconds, using a generic quantity of savour and water or ice to move and smooth every part of the hands.
The hands must be broken against each other through walking between the hairs.
In the case of residues under the bowls, it is possible to use a pool browse to remove them.
As the branches present in the water are subject to stay on the hands, it is important to be raised and followed with a own service.
After the switch, the paper service should be used to close the robotnet (and open the output door the event).
This allows you to disappear your hands to contact the surface contact.
The objective of the lavage of the hands in health structures is to remove pathogene microorganisms (“girmes”) and to escape their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of cleaning hands remains inacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and sisters who regularly forget to lay up their hands before touching their patients, which favors the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, the fact that the hands are correctly laying and following other simple procedures can reduce 66 % of blood infections related to category. The World Health Organization has published a brochure described the standard procedure to follow to lay down and smooth his hands in the health area.
The draft guidelines on the hygiene of the hands established by the Organization may also be consulted on the website to collect the comments of the internal.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
Applications available in the trade may measure and ensure the manual hygiene if the respect of the regulation is obtained.
The World Health Organization defined "5 indications" relating to the manual hygiene:
after an exposition to blood/to a biological liquid;
before a aseptic geste; and
After having contact with the patient. The fact that you add antiseptical chemical products to the science (we know "medicical" or "antimicrobians") provides the hand-lavage agent an action of destruction of the grames.
It is able to eliminate these shirts before a cyrurgical operation or in environments where antibiotic organisms are extremely expanded. For "froter" hands for a chirurgical operation, it is necessary to have a robotnet that can open and close it without touching it with the hands, a product of clorohexid or aid-based lavage product to save the hands after the aircraft, a brother steel to seize and another steel tool to clean up the underline.
All bottles must be removed.
In the framework of this procedure, it is necessary to launch its hands and forwards, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
It's not necessary to smoke his hands for 10 minutes.
In the shipment, it is necessary to disappear the water on the front brains to the hands.
Once the hands are lavage, it must seize his hands by using a sterile ring and fill a chirurgical house.
To reduce the propagation of herms, it is better to lay his hands or to use an antiseptic for the hands before and after being occupied by a sick person.
With regard to the control of infections in the hospitals, the main benefits of the lavage were obtained during the first 20 % of the lavage, and there were only few additional benefits to increase the frequency of the hands of lavage at least 35%.
If it is compared to the lavage of hands carried out with an ordinary sample made with an antibacterian sample, the level of infected bakterian diseases to food is more than three times higher. In comparison with the cleaning of hands with an alcohol solution and the lavage of hands with an antibacterian savana during a average 30 seconds, it is considered that the first reduction of the bacterin contamination of 26% by the second.
But knowledge and water are more efficient than alcohol products to reduce the virus of the grippe A (H1N1) and the Clostridium sports on the hands. To improve the hygiene of the hands in health care facilities, it is particularly possible to form the personal on the lavage of hands, to make more alcohol products based on the provision of this and to address him written reminders and wonders about it.
More research needs to find the most effective interventions in various health structures.
In developing countries, it is considered that the lavage of hands to science is a little cost and essential tool that allows to maintain health, to be food correctly.
However, because of the missing of faithful water points, knowledge or installations to lay hands to house, school and workplace, it is difficult to come to establish universal habits in the hands' higiene.
For example, in the largest part of the rural Africa, it is amazing to find robots to launch their hands closely to private or public tolets, although there are economic options to build hands-water stations.
However, the low loading rates of hands can also be imputable to tenage habits, instead of a missing saving or water.
To promote the lavage of hands to science and to take sensibilisation activities in this regard can influence political decisions, to know the benefits related to this practice and to change long-term behaviour within the population.
In order to achieve this approach, it is necessary to ensure follow-up and evaluation activities.
A systematic test of 70 studies stated that local approaches are efficient to increase the rate of launching hands in low and intermediary countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. In regard to the promotion of the launch of hands in schools, they can quote the example of " Applause three stars " of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and small cost measures to ensure that the students are hands with all knowledge, respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are achieved, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hands-lavage stations can be included in the campaigns for promoting the hygiene of the hands that are carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
The World Day of Lavage Hand is another example of sensibilisation campaign that wants to promote the evolution of the conduct.Suspends to the coronavirus pandemia of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoisy to illustrate the lavage of hands.
A few studies have examined the global cost efficiency report for the launch of hands in developing countries in relation to the number of lives in good health (the same is DALY's exited).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands to science is much more valuable than other water and exploitation interventions.
The importance of the lavage of hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerability situation such as mothers who come to buy or soldiers in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the middle of the XIXst century by two pioneers of the hands of the human health: Hungrois Ignaz Semelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern diseases.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were two of the fatigue fatigue called mysmes.
In 1980, food origin epidemies and neocomial infections have led the United States Centres for control and prevention of diseases to promote more actively the hygiene of the hands as essential means to prevent infections.
The appearance of the porcine grip in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemia in 2020 led to a larger conscience in many countries on the need to lay hands with wisdom to premure against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, shows illustrating the “good hands shipping techniques ” were located near the eggs in public tours and in the office buildings and airports.
The expression “laying hands” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be complied of something.
It is issued of a Bible verse of Matthew in which Ponce Pilate lays the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression was widely expanded in some English communities.
In Macbeth, of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth tried to lay his hands complicatively to try to clean a imaginary tattoo, symbol of her bad conscience at the view of the crimes she had committed and she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also convinced that some persons, after recalling having committed acts contrary to the ethics or have been considered to do it, are trying to lay their hands more frequently than others and to give more value to the hands-launch devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to launch their hands after having received this type of thoughts are less attached to other compensative measures of purification, such as the beneficiary.
Some religions require the lavage of hands to purpose at the time hygiene and symbolic. The symbolic lavage of hands, which is to use water and non of knowledge to lay hands, make part of the shipping rituals of hands set before in many religions, including bahaism and Hinduism, immmersion (thevilah) and the ritual absence of hands (Netilat Yadaim) in the Jewish, the lavabo in the Christianism and the whud whud in the lalams. The religions also prescribe the hands of hygiene, in particular after some actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligated to lay his hands after being gone to the toilets.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam requires to lay his hands before and after every food.
Controls of COVID-19 on workplace
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace indicate the implementation of health and safety methodology to work for the control of risks in order to prevention of the disease in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The controls of adequate risks on the workplace and tasks are based on the assessment of the risks of exposition sources, the severity of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who can be vulnerable to infection by COVID-19.
According to the Office of Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowly risk of exposition works have a minimum professional contact with public and other collaborators. In this case, only base prevention measures against infection are recommended, including the lavage of hands, the encouragement of workers to stay in the house if they are sick, the respiratory label, and the maintainment of a cleaning and a rotation of the work environment.
Mediterranean exposition employment includes the needs of frequency or extract contacts with persons without suspect or recognised COVID-19, but can be infected because of a Community transfer or international travelling.
This includes workers in contact with the great public, particularly in schools, work environments to high population depth and some major detailed environments.
The risk controls in this group, including the basic infection prevention measures, includes a ventilation using high-efficient air filters, hygiene vitros and the establishment of a individual protection equipment in case of a COVID-19.
The OSHA consists of health workers and feeders exposed to persons with a suspected COVID-19 or known as a high risk of exposition, which pass to a very high rise if they produce aircraft or preliminary processes or manipulation of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The adequate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure salts and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemies may have several effects on workplace.
Workers may be absent because they are sick, they must take care of others or fear a possible exposition.
Commercial models can change, as well as the goods requested and methods to buy them (including their courses outside the points of time or using delivery or driver services).
Finally, the expiration of articles from severe geographical regions affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A preparation and response plan to infected diseases can be used as guidance for protection measures.
The plans have a consideration of risk levels associated with different works and tasks, including exposition sources, risk factors related to family and community context and individual risk factors of workers such as an advanced age or chronic pathogens.
They also require the necessary controls to face these risks and urgent plans for the susceptible situations to be presented after epidemies.
The preparation and response plans to infected diseases may make national or regional recommendations.
The response objectives to an epidemia include the reduction of the transfer between the personnel, the protection of persons in higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of trade operations and the reduction of inadequate effects on other entities of their approvisionship chains.
The severity of disease in the community where the company is located affects the responses applied.
The risk control herarchie forms a global framework used in health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, monitoring administrative controls and finally individual protection equipment.
Technical controls affect the employees of the risks linked to the worklessness of workers, which can constitute the most economic solution to implement.
Administrative controls design the changes of policy or procedures to work required by the part of the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered as less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can contribute to prevent some expositions.
All EPI types must be selected in accordance with the risk of the worker, correctly adjusted according to the requirements (e.g., respiratory masks), ports correctly and systematically, inspects regularly, maintained and replaced according to the requirements, and correctly removed, cleaned and stored or rejected to avoid any contamination.
According to the Office of Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the less risk of exposition works have a minimum professional contact with the public and other collaborators.
The basis for the prevention of the infection recommended for all workplaces include a frequency and minute lavage, encouragement of workers to stay in the house if they are sick, respiratory label, including covering the mouth and neighborhood for all and exert, provide smokes and pools, preparation to television or working hours in the need, the dissuasion of workers to use the tools and equipment of others, and the clean management and deficiency of the role of work environment.
The identification and quick isolation of potentially infected persons constitutes a crucial step for the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others on a workplace.
The Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) in the United States recommend the employees who presented similar respiratory symptoms to stay at home until they have no longer fiber signs, fibres and any other symptoms since at least 24 hours without use of febriovens or other medicines operating on symptoms. They also recommend to apply the policies of flexible disease, to allow the employees to stay at home to take the house for a member of the family’s disease and to inform the employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, medium exhibition employment includes those who need a frequency or extreme contact, at least six feet (1,8 m), people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but they can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of a Community transmission within the seat of the company or because the person has recently conducted a international travel in a region with a broad transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the large public, in particular in schools, work environments, high-dependence of the population and some high-detail environments. The technical controls for this group and the higher risk includes the installation of high-efficient air filters, the increase of windling rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparency and the installation of a window for the service service. The administrative controls for the group and the higher risks are raised up to the higher employment, the replacement of the work, the establishment of physical barriers such as the transparency of plastic dimensions, and the establishment of a range of ranges, the range of ECU, the range of dimensions, the ECF, the range of ranges foreign ranges, the range of investment, the ECU, the range of dimensions, the dimensions for the range of the range of the range of the range, the range of the ECB, the range of the range of the age of the range of the age of the age of the age of the age of the EC, the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age, and the age of the range, and the age of the age of the range, and the work, and the work, and the range of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the range, and the age of the age of the age of the age of the range of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the range, and the age of the EC, and the age of the age of the range, and the age of the age of the age, and the age, and the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the range, and the range of the EC, and the range of the range, and the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the age, the EC, the EC, and the EC, and the range, and the range of the range of the range of the , and the age, and the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the age, and the range of the range of the age, and the range of the range of the range, and the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the EC, the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range, the , the , the , the , the , the , and the range of the range of the , and the range, the range, and the range, and the range, and the , and the , and the , and the , and the range, and the range, the , the range, the range, the range, the range, the range, the range, the range, and the ranges, and the rangements of the rangements of the rangement in the rangements of the rangement, and the range,
Workers of this risk group have hardly needed to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick on a air, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passors include the following measures: separate the disease of others by a distance of 6 feet, design a member of the equipment to take care of the disease and offer a mask of protection to the disease, or ask him to hide the mouth and to smoke it with the help of mocking when all or forever.
Cabine equipment must be carried out steel medical genes when it is busy with a sick passager or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the disease pasteur is present from the feed, a persistent toy or respiratory difficulties.
Gants and other steel articles must be set up in a sack to dangerous biological deficits and the contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and desinfected afterwards. For trade navigation, including cross-border ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the report of the travel in case of disease, as well as the auto-isolation and the immediate information of the medical center if it develops a fifty or other symptoms once to border.
Idealy, a medical follow-up should be located in the isolated person's box. For school and children ' s care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closement for cleaning and desinfection purposes if a person has become infected in a school building, independently of the Community propagation.
In the case of minimised Community transmission, social distance strategys can be implemented, such as annulation of pedagogic sorrows, assemblies and other important collections such as physical or carnal education courses or food in the cantine, increased space between offices, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate inheritance for children who are present grip symptoms.
In the case of important transfers in the local community, including social distance strategy, a long-term school vacation can be considered. For the forces of the order that fulfill every day routine activities, immediate health risk is considered as low by CDCs.
Agency of the order forces that should enter into contact with persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance, including the port of an appropriate individual protection equipment.
In the case of close contact during a arrest, the workers must clean and desinfect their equipment and services before reuse using a lenette or spray detergent and follow the standard finishment procedures and implementation of the EPI used as well as clothing and lavage.
The OSHA consists of some health and funeral workers as a high or very high risk of exposition.
The high risk of exposition employees include health, support, lab and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers in a very high risk of exposition if they are conducting aircraft procedures or preliminary or manipulation of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
The aircraft procedures include the integration, the industry procedures of towels, bronchoscopes, some dental tests and procedures, or the invasive preliminary preliminary preliminary proceedings.
Further exposure employment includes workers involved in the preparation of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known during their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they practice a autopsie. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include the isolation salts for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including during the implementation of procedures produced by aross.
A specialized negative pressure ventilation can be appropried in certain health and funeral environments.
Exemples must be manipulated using the precautions of biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (OMS) recommends to separate patients entering in different expectations in accordance with COVID-19 supply. In addition to other EPI, the OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons who work at least 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known infection by SARS-CoV-2 and for the operation of aircraft procedures.
In the United States, N95 respiratory filtering masks approved by NIOSH or above should be used in the context of a full and write respiratory program including adaptation, training and medical tests.
Other types of respiratory masks can ensure a higher protection and a better comfort of the worker. WOMS does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease instead of transmitting organic liquids.
The OMS recommends the port of a chirurgical mask only by the depth person at the input point.
For those who collect respiratory scans, they support or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aircraft procedures, the OMS recommends a chirurgical mass, a cyrurgical mask, or a easy screen, a block and cancer.
In the case of aerosol procedure, the chirurgical mask is replaced by a N95 respiratory mask or FFP2.
Since the global approval of EPI is insufficient, the WHO recommends to limit the need of EPI by the telemedicancy, physical barriers such as transparency windows, to limit access to a place occupied by a COVID-19 patient directly involved in its care, the use of the EPI required for specific task only, the use of the same respiratory masker continues to be carried out in support of several patients with the same diagnostic, on the coordination and coordination of the EPI approvision and disappearance of mass for individuals.

We are found this month in an exceptional situation.
COVID-19 epidemia is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and responsibilities that we have each other.
His deficits are in the past, but we know that our best response retains the type of empathy, cooperation and strengthening Community in the world scale that is in the heart of this organization.
The company and welcome we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and conversations are a marvelous witness of incredible human beings with which we have the chance to work.
I couldn't be more appreciative and honorable for all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone made me part of his gratitude to our work.
This person reminded me of what it is important for the world to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible through your work, to maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
It's a moment that not only what we do, but also how we do it, there will be a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will continue to follow the following adjustments in the way we work together from the next week.
Adjustments of our work and time work
As Robyn mentioned higher, the team reached last night to discuss our approach and time work in days and months to come.
During this conversation, we have considered what would be according to us an adapted answer to the situation that we face and the best way to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
We were before to eliminate the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take the reculation, don't worry.
All members of the personnel, subtractors and contractors:
our work time will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until the new order.
We don't tell a feast day: if you are in order to ensure more normal work hours, you can be useful for the mission.
However, the world is invisible at the present time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, make courses or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should go without saying, but we'll say it.
No disease or payment arrêt required: just prevent your higher and help your team to review the calendars and employment of time to ensure that the main work areas are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed in COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T&amp Department;C Ops to help T&amp;C and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention of the direction).
The time personnel will be totally rewarded.
We have already announced it, and we will repeat our commitment to honor our responsibilities against our subtractors and our members of the time personnel.
Everyone will be shared on the basis of its normal working hours in normal conditions.
That's true if you're sick and incapable of work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use the work as a way to evacuate their stress connected to the world around us.
What we do can be increasingly grateful, in particular in periods such as this.
Once again, the goal is to keep you.
We just ask you to communicate with your above, so that we know what to wait and take the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered as essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE teams, Ops RH, Confidence & amp; Security and Fund Collection (in others) make a essential work that may need strength.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on the support of fundamental tasks for our mission.
There's enough work for each of us, we'll just focus on the most essential projects.
Ralenter's not going to do so much later.
We don't have the intention to “work twice more to raise the lost time” when the pandemia is passed.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to respect now irrerealists.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will try to establish new objectives and achieve the event.
What is the APP (annual planning)?
To adjust our new reality and the purposes of day-time work, we are proposed to adjust the expenditure for our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose a extension of our plan 2019-2020 that provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, take care of them and their neighborhood, applying to those who need or want to see their work time in the future weeks.
This prolongation of achievements reduces significantly the lack of work and pressure of the current planning in the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week, and we will report the delegates and teams of the next steps after confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Desktop situation, exposition and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based on San Francisco could have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, exceeding proudness, we called an anti-viral cleaning team to desinfect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital quality anti-viral solution to desinfect all the surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and the assessment boxes on our stage.
The building reviewed its own protocol to be delegated that uses products ensuring the safety of its locators.
We are convinced that the office will be prepared well when we decide to come back.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which shared with us and all members of the personnel based on Washington DC their COVID-19 protocol.
Since the last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a entirely distance in accordance with the Councils of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of praise a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they could be updated.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our usual colleagues from a distance work have aware that adaptation may be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Decrease the time of meetings at meetings of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider them to be distributed for several days.
Definite clearly the meeting, having a agenda of the day, and sending the documentation forward.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage cooperation and change directly.
Place a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, a person to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and from someone who helps to take notes (or carry a collective notes).
Send a email to technical support if you need a comfortable box.
Use your payment well for collections.
Meet the channel #remoties on Slack to talk to your colleagues of the work distribution
The RH operating team studys thetenomical guidelines based on webs to support the increase of the work distribution in the Fund.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community subvention to announce public events financed by Wikimedia, such as editing them, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemia.
We explained to them that we understand that our restrictions and other restrictions could be impossible to realize their agreed subvention activities and that no one would be penalized in the case of late or modifying these objectives.
The next week, we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be at the time of suffering and suffering before clarity and the opportunity to concentrate on its own communities, Wikipedia and others.
For the following, the CRT works for the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Remain in contact, although the problems connected to COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendar for a special meeting of the next Jewish personnel, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will benefit from this time to share other updates, answer your questions and pass time together.
This situation is concerned with us and we are here to help you in some way.
From here you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Wiki Office.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same place.
We also try to maintain regular communications with members of the personnel in countries that are currently severely touched.
If you have questions about movements, events, an important work feed or covering difficulties, or if you need help for what others, don't have to prevent and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and ensure the event.
For any confidential or sensitive question, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of the International RH Operations.
No of these amendments should be considered as a loss of our work and our obligations.
It is in contrast to recognize that our work and our obligations will probably be approved in a way without previously.
These steps are the necessary to support us mutually and to continue our work, to bring our movement the help he needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can count.
Our job will be here to wait for us the time comes.
For the time, it is time to move and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and maybe the months to come.
We need each one of you to come there, so you need to keep and take care of your families to give the best of you.
Finally, if you please: Leave your hands and don't touch your face!

b'The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cell mixtures) of the bulk cells, arts, heart, rain and intestins.
ACE2 against the enzyme of angiotensine (ACE) in reducing the quantity of angiotensine II and increased Ang (1-7) that makes it a medically promising objective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the input point in the cells of certain coronavirus.
Human version of enzyme is often designed under the name of hACE2.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metal-enzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endotelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a M2 peptidase area for termination N and a collection of amine axis transporter area to termination C.
The ACE2 is a single protein of a single traveling type I, which is the active area on the enzymatic plan is exposed on the surface of the pumon cells and other tissues.
The extracellent area of the ACE2 is carried out from the transmembrance area by another ishdase enzyme; the soluble protein that results is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is presented in most of the bodies: the ACE2 is related to the cell mixture of the cells of type II polymonal alveoles, enerrocytes of green entity, arther and veinous cells and arterial cells of the most organs.
The expression of the ARNm of the ACE2 is also presented in the cerebral cortex, strytum, hypothalamus and the cerebral throne.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the ACE.
The ACE claims the angiotensine I hormone in angiotensine II vasoconstrict.
The ACE2 carboxyl carboxyl termion of angiotensine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-II-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in angiotensine vasodillatical (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-I-I-His-Pro-OH).
The ACE2 can also climate several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and Greenline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrarian circulation of the amine SLC6A19 aid transporter and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, the ACE2 constitutes the main entry point in the cells of certain coronavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (in the origin of the MIRS); and SARS-CoV-2 (wirus in the origin of COVID-19).
Further, the connection of the SARS-CoV S1 protein and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic area of ACE2 to the surface of cells results in encytose and the translocation of virus and enzyme in the enzymes located within cells.
This input process also requires the immortalisation of protein S by serious host protection TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this last makes the object of insurance as potential treatment. This brings some to think that reduction of ACE2 in cells can contribute to combat infection.
However, several professional society and regulatory bodies recommended to continue standard treatment with the ACE and ARB inhibitor.
A systematic exam and a meta-analyse published on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of the ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of the risk of pneumony in respect of witnesses.”
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumony was also reduced in patients treated by ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumony, in particular the victims of AVC and the heart disagreement.
The use of the ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction of mortality linked to the pneumonium, although results were less provided than for the global risk of pneumonium.”
The enzyme of transformation of angiotensine 2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is a pressure as an unbelievable treatment of severe pulmonary launches and seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamic and the oxygen saturation in the porcelets that are achieved by the lipolysaccharide.
The half life of the rhACE2 in the man is about 10 hours, and the interval of action is 30 minutes in more than the period of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Many conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for inherent persons to the classic inhibitors of the renein-angiotensin system (SRA) or for diseases presenting an elevated circulation of angiotensin II. The rhACE2 under perfusion was evaluated in the clinical test framework for the treatment of the hygiene respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contacts in the context of the coronavirus pandemia 2019-20, which is the identification of persons (' contacts ') to be in contact with a person infected.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government on certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Many infrastructures have been carried out for the concept of contact training applications.
These systems, in particular those who are concerned about the geographical location of application users, include matters on respect of private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to save the nearby user with other portable phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced the direct integration in their Android and iOS operating systems that allow the support of these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese Government, in association with Alipay, has developed a application in China that allows citizens to check if they have been contacted with portized COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapor has, about it, optioned for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of informants, it was provided in open source and will be delivered to the Government. The North Macedonian has started "LotKorona!", a bluetooth application that ensures the exhibition of potentially infected persons and communicating rapidly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Health Ministry.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was attentively approved by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government declared that the application of contacts was in an advanced development stage and could be developed during the next weeks. A similar application is provided in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and the New Zealand advise to establish applications on the model of TraceTogether in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geoperaging application for patients presenting a COVID-19 diagnosis and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Intelligence in Cambridge University, has expressed several possible practices related to the use of systems based on applications, including false positive and potential efficiency, if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to the concerns on the propagation of the "coronavirus" applications lying or nocivas, Apple only allows the "official" organisms or generally worthy of confidence to add applications linked to the Coronavirus to App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Militarians for the protection of private life have been part of their concerns on the implications of coronavirus applications on mass monitoring, in particular the eventually delaying of the monitoring infrastructure created to face the coronavirus pandemia once the disagreement.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement called to the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have established eight conditions to respect in the framework of government projects:
the monitoring should be “law, necessary and proportionate”;
the extensions of control and monitoring should be carried out extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating COVID-19;
the safety of data and anonymate should be demonstredly protected;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization should be absorbed;
all data shared with third parties should be defined in the law;
It should prevent protection against abuses and reviews for citizens in case of abuses;
The "significant participation" of all "related parties" would be obligatory, including the experts in public health and marginalised groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and without border reporters (Reporter without Grenzen) (RSF) also published checklists in Germany.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple is to address the problem of the persistent monitoring by removeing the track mechanism of their equipment system since it is not necessary.
Some countries used a network geolocalisation system instead of applications, which eliminates the need for downloading an application and the capacity to escape the trace.
In Israel, the network trace was approved.
The network solutions with access to brute geolocalisation data are important potential problems on the respect of private life.
However, all systems on central servers don't need to access personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows to respect private life (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that has not reposed on an application was used for contacts.
Instead of use of a dedicated application, the system collected track information to various sources, including mobile and transaction data, which then have been associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of these information to warn potential contacts, the Government also made the information of accessible location to public, which was authorised by the deep changes brought to the confidentiality laws of the MERS epidemic of this country.
These information are available to publicly through several applications and web sites. countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems to maintain private life.
The details were not yet communicated on 6 April 2020.
The trace of contacts respecting private life is a good concept established since 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than twelve expert groups worked on private life solutions, including the Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) to store the nearby of a user with other portable phones.
However, the PEP-PT project is a coordination effort that involves centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a unique protocol. Decentralized Protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, anciently called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracting (PACT), between others.
These protocols allow to ensure that identifying personal data will never leave the device and that all corresponding measures are implemented on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab now develops SafePaths, a platform of use of private life conservation technology during collection and use of localisation or contact data to follow COVID-19.
This technology reposes on the results of the white book “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. The SafeTrace de Enigma MPC platform, a company developing private protection technologies based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe material technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without checking confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition TCN was founded by groups collected around a common approach and protocols in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global interoperability of training and warning applications, an essential factor of their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, which controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact track initiative, saying that it would allow her to keep the private life and associate the Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a confidential energy cryptography.
They also published the specifications of base technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be developed in three phases:
Deployment of tools allowing governments to create official training applications for coronavirus respecting private life
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android. Google and Apple proposed to set up the problems of adoption of the solution and sustainability of monitoring by initially distributing the system by the updates of the exploitation system and to remove it later from the same way once far away.
The reposition of a medicine (equivalently called reorientation, reprofilation, reaperability or reaperability of a medicine) shows the reconversion of an approved medicine for a disease or a different medicine affection for which it was initially developed.
This is a current scientific research axis to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axis include the development of a vaccin against COVID-19 and the transfusion of convalent persons. The SARS-CoV-2 presents about 66 terapeutic objectives, each of them containing several connections sites.
The analysis of these connection sites offers the realistic development project of effective antiviral medicine against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, there are the protease of papain type, the Polymerase ARN dependent, helicopter, S protein and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, and al. studied several candidate components that later optimized and analysed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar medicines approved to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicine in their preclinical study to recognize in the concept of a clinical study.
Chlorocine is also an antipaludean medicine used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the OMS announced that the clorocine and the apparent hydroxychlorocyne would be part of the four studied medicines in the Solidarity clinical test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the tests of the State of New York on the chlorocine and hydroxychlorocyne would start on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorocine sulfate and the chlorocine phosphate in accordance with urgency use (EUA).
The treatment was not approved by the clinical test process of the FDA and is authorised by the U.S. only as experimental treatment for urgent use in hospitalized patients but can not get a treatment in a clinical test.
The CDC stated that “the use, dose or administration of hydroxychlorocine for prevention or treatment of infection in SARS-COV-2” is not yet established.
The doctors have indicated to use this medicine when there is no other option.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul brings a small study on the use of chlorocine in association with zinc, vitamine A, vitamine C and vitamine D.
The larger studies are in Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School provides a test on safety and effectiveness of preventive hydroxychlorokine.
Chinese clinical tests realized in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was “ clearly effective. ”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negatively in a average period of 4 days while the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan over 240 patients who suffer Pneumonian, half received favipiravir and the other half of the humifenovir.
The Italian Agency of Medicines reminded the public that existing evidence for medicine are small and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that she would buy the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that she would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to heal the patients of COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe opened opportunities to the Trump administration can get the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in the serious cases of the disease where the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be sure for adult women or those who try to create.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a association of the lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral, concluded that no benefit was observed.
These medicines were designed to inhibit HIV replication in relation to protease.
A group of researchers in Colorado University tries to modify these medicines to find a component that would be linked to the protection of the SARS-CoV-2. There are critics in the scientific community about the use of resources for the reposition of medicines in particular for HIV/SIDA.
The OMS included lopinavire/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
The remedesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and viral infections Marburg. Then Gilead Sciences discovered that the remedesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several philosyrus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
An anti-viral treatment problem is the development of a resistance by mutations that can generate a disease and more severe transmission.
Some previous studies before the test suggest that the remedesivir may have an elevated genetic barrier against the resistence. Many clinical tests are currently, among those two carried out by Cleveland university hospitals; one porting on people who suffer a blue pathology and the other on the more severe forms.
There are three clinical tests in intravenous vitamine C for patients who are hospitalized and seriously disease of COVID-19; two controls against placebo (Chinee and Canada) and one without control (Italia).
The State of New York began tests on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre of Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical test on the Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatical patients infected by the new coronavirus.
An enzyme of enzyme of Angiotensin 2, a phase II test is running with 200 patients to recruit between several hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Foreign researchers of the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colcicin in reduction of inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients who suffer moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6 000 adults of 40 years and more, which have been diagnosed positively to COVID-19 and present moderate symptoms that have not required hospitalisation.
Women who have no effective contraceptive methods are not admitted.
Many antiagulars are testing in Italy.
Molecular low low hepatitis is widely used to treat patients, which incentives the Italian agent of medicines to publish Directives on its use.
A multicentrical study of 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the reposition of approved antiviral medicines that have been developed for previous epidemies such as the MERS, the MISE and the Western Nil virus.
Ribavirine: Ribavirine was recommended to treat COVID-19 in accordance with the seventh editing of Chinese Directives
Umifenovir: Humphenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the seventh editing of Chinese Directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccin is a hypothetic vaccin against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccin has passed clinical tests, many development trials are currently running.
Last February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) stated that no vaccin was expected against SARS-CoV-2, virus in the origin of the disease, at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccin candidates were in a security study of phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemia was declared through the world in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop a vaccin.
Many organizations use published genes to develop potential vaccins against SARS-CoV-2.
Determined in April, the imperative CEPI initiatives for the implementation of a vaccin are the speed, the production capacity, the large scale deployment and the global access.
In April, scientists of the CEPI have indicated that 10 different technological platforms were designed for research and development projects in the beginning of 2020 to create effective vaccin against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform passed in phase I Security study are included:
Nuclear acid (DNA and ARN) (phase I of developer and vaccin candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccin candidate: CanSino Biology, Adénual vector 5)
As the scientists of the CEPI in April stated it, 115 vaccin candidates are in the first development towns which 78 (79 of the Milken institution) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with little available public information (continued during planning or conception).
A phase I-II takes preliminary safety and immunogenic tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and completed in several centres, determined more effective doses.
The phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a witness group, and test the efficiency of vaccin in the prevention of the disease, although monitoring the immediate effects to optimal dose.
Within the 79 vaccine candidates in the active development (confied first April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment phase (for preclinical research).
At the next 24 January 2020 in Australia, the Queensland University announced that she studied the potential of a molecular vaccin that would genericly change the viral proteins to stimulate an immunitary reaction.

in development and production of vaccins.
Partners also announced preclinical test projects and a clinical test of phase I for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they worked on 11 isolates and that even in a accelerated procedure, it would have to be about a year and half to two years to develop a vaccin.
On 12 March 2020, Medikago, a Chebec biotechnology company, indicated to develop a similar part of coronavirus through the party financing of Canadian health research institutions.
The vaccin candidate is currently investigated in laboratory, the tests on the man are provided for July or August 2020.
Before this week, the Guardian announced that the American President Donald Trump had offered to TrueVac "sufficient money to benefit exclusive access to vaccin against COVID-19", which has suffered the Protestation of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German BioNTech company for the cooperating development of a vaccin based on ARNm.
The vaccin candidate based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical test phase with the beginning of clinical tests expected April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology society, announced that she had preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of her final vaccin can start at the top.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemies (CEPI) announced an investment of 4,9 million US$ in a consortium to investigate a vaccin against COVID-19, including the Pastor Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, taking the total investment of the CEP in the development of a vaccin against COVID-19 to 29 million dollars.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of a vaccin against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curvac, Inovio, Newvax University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started tests on six different vaccins.
The researchers of the Emperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 to develop an auto-amplaying ARN vaccin against COVID-19.
The vaccin candidate was developed in the 14 days after sending the sequence by China.
On March, the Canadian Government announced a financing of 275 million C$ for 96 research projects on medical reactions against COVID-19, including several vaccin candidates in Canadian society and universities such as Medical and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced the estimation of 192 million dollars in the development of a vaccin against COVID-19 with national vaccins projects containing several new vaccins that can be used if other coronavirus epidemies are produced.
On 2 April 2020, the researchers of the Medical School of Pittsburgh have indicated a potential vaccin against the COVID-19 in the mouse, saying that “the sub-units of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 driving by microaiguilles were a significant response of the specific anticorps of ancient [see the mouse] observed 2 weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, April 16, 2020, the pharmacy school of Waterloo University announced the concept of a vaccin candidate based on DNA under the potential form of a nasal spray.
With bacterophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacterias to produce similar inoffensive particules to virus particules that could stimulate the production of anticorps against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immunitary system.
In March 2020, the American government, the industry and three universities have made their resources common to access IBM superordinators, associated with computer resources held on the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccins have the herogenic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond their disease.
Another test in Australia is proposed to include 4 170 health professionals.
It is possible that development vaccins are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccin using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mouses, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need for implementing biosecurity limit measures for the manipulation of live virus and a international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccins against MISE and MERS were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020 there is no medicine or protector vaccine against the MID that demonstrated its safety and efficiency in humans.
According to the research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccins and medicines to treat the MISE was a priority for governments and health agencies of the whole world. There is no vaccin tested vaccin against the MERS.
When the MERS was expanded, it was thought that the existing research on the IMS could use a model to develop vaccins and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one only vaccin against the MERS (based on the DNA) had completed the clinical tests of phase I in human and three others; all vaccins were in viral vectors, two adénovial vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and a MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have distributed theory of the complot according to which the virus in the origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccin was already available.
Shorts cited by various social networks are refered to existing shorts to genetic sequences and vaccins for other coronavirous summers such as the MISE coronavirus.
The disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavir 2 linked to a serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms comprehend fibres, touxs and suffering.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscular pain, diarrhee, gorge males, loss of goat and abdominal pain.
The time between the exposition and the appearance of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can explore between two and four days.
While most of the cases generate moderate symptoms, some develop to a viral pneumonium and a deficiency of several bodies.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases were reported in the world in 210 countries and territory, generating more than 153 000 dead.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. Virus is mainly propagated in contact with nearby, often produced by glucose, extern or speaking.
These bottles are produced in the expiration are generally falling on the ground or on the surfaces instead of representing an infectious risk on long distances.
Persons can also be infected by touching a harmful surface, then touching the eyes, the nest or the mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces until 72 hours.
It is the most careful in the three first days after the appearance of symptoms, although the county is possible before the appearance of symptoms and during the last phase of the disease. The standard test method uses the inverse transscription of the reaction in the real polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of mask is recommended for those who think to be infected by virus and their suits.
The mask port recommendations by the public in general are various, some authorities declare their use, others recommending their use, and others still imposing their use.
There are currently no vaccin or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most of the six countries of the UN.
Persons infected by virus may be asymptomatical or develop grip symptoms such as fever, tows, fatigue, supply.
The urgency symptoms include difficulties to respirate, a pain or a constant threat pressure, a confusion, difficulties to walk and a white face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
More often, higher respiratory symptoms such as eternity, nasal earlier or gorge's badness can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausees, smoking and diarrhee were observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China were first presented only a touric pressure and pipes.
In some cases, the disease can cause a pneumony, the disease of several organs and death.
That's what we call incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can go to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people who develop symptoms will make it in 11.5 days after infection. Reports indicate that all infected persons will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatical portors in the transmission is still not fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the propagation of the disease.
The proportion of infected persons who do not have symptoms is now unknown and at the study. The Korean prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatics during their hospitalisation.
The National Health Commission began to include asymptomatical cases in its quotidian cases on April 166 infections this day, 130 (78 %) were asymptomatics at the time of the test.
Expectoration and salve can transport both of important viral charges.
The fact of speaking stronger is more free than the fact of talking normally.
A study in Singapore declared that alloying without protecting can project goats at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the national science academy suggested that the transmission by bioaerosol could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the collars outside the rooms of the patients have produced positive similitudes to the viral ARN.
Certain medical procedures such as the integration and the reanimation of cardiopulmonary (RCP) can spread of respiratory secretions and therefore enter a air propagation.
Although there are concerns about a propagation through the seals, this risk is as low. The virus is the worst when people present symptoms; although propagation can be possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Prevention and Control Centre of Diseases (ECDC) states that if you still don't know exactly with the facility of the disease, one person generally counts two to three others.
Examplely, the virus could be detected on a day on the carton, three days on the plastic (polypropylen) and inoxydable acid (AISI 304) and at the four hours of the cube at 99 %.
However, this is different in the meaning of humidity and temperature.
Science and detergents are also efficient if correctly used; science products degrade the lipidic layer of the virus, which is disabled and elimination of the hair and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a desinfective chirurgical desinfection) are less efficacy. In a study in Hong Kong, two days after the start of hospitalization have been preliminary.
In five patients on six, the first cancer declared the highest viral charge, while in the sixth patient the highest viral charge was on the second tested day.
The coronavirus 2 linked to a serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for the serious respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people of pneumonia related to the case of a similar respiratory disease of Whan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in coronavires appeared in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the worst savon, who breaks his protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a neighborhood of the SARS-CoV origin.
Pumons are the most touched bodys of COVID-19 because the virus is accessible to host cells through the average of the enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is the most awarded in the type II-alveolar cells of the pomons.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoproteine called "spicule" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE 2 and penetrate in the host cell.
Alike heart illness has been signed at 12% of the persons admitted to Wuhan hospital in China, and they are more frequently when the disease is serious.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher, because of the systemic inflammatory response and the difficulties of immunitary system during the progress of the disease, however, myocarde’s aligned launching can also be linked to the ACE 2 receivers in heart.
The ACE 2 receivers are strongly expressed in the heart and in the implicated heart functions.
An elevated thrombose infection (31%) and a vineous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with infections in COVID-19 and could be associated with a disfavourable prognosis. The autopsies of the COVID-19 deceeded persons have shown difference alveoling (DAD) and inflammatory inflammatory infiltrations containing lymphocytes in the pumon.
Although SARS-COV-2 provides a tropism for the hospital cells of respiratory routes that express the ACE-2, patients of the COVID-19 are severely presented systematic hyperinflammation symptoms.
These are particularly the GM-CSF Secret Cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes held in the IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients from COVID-19.
Lymphocytary infiltrates were also reported to the autopsy.
The OMS has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse transscription of the reaction stringed by polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally realized on respiratory scales obtained by rhinopharined preliminary; however, a nasal or expectoration preliminary can also be used.
Generally, the results are available for a few hours, until two days.
blood tests can also be used, however, they require two blood preliminaries taken in two weeks and results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists could cut a coronavirus summer and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories part of the world could develop independently the policy reaction tests (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, anticorps tests (acceptable to decline active infections and the previous infection of a person) were in developing, but not yet used.
The Chinese test experience declared a precision of only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA to the United States approved the first test at the next time of the patient on 21 March 2020 before being used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan hospital of the University of Wuhan suggested that infections based on clinical characteristics and on the epidemological risk.
Multi-lobable bilateral opacity with a device, asymetric and poster distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of infection.
Domaining under plorary, crazy paving (interloculary seed exhaustion with variable alveolar complication) and consolidation can appear with the progress of the disease.
A few data are available on microscopic lessons and on COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological statements in Autopsia are:
Macroscopie: weep, pericardite, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary egg
Four types of gravity of viral pneumonies can be observed:
moderate pneumony: pulmonary egg, pneumocytary hyperplasy, extensive atypical pneocytes, interstitical inflammation with lymphocytary infiltration and training of multinucleated genetic cells
severe pneumony: divergence alveolar dommage (DAD) with diffus alveolar exsuades.
The DAD is the cause of the syndrome of augly respiratory depression (SDRA) and the severe hypoxim.
Pneumony in the field of guarantee: exploitation organization in alveolic and interstitical pulmonary fibrose
Sang : Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risks of infection includes staying in itself, escape the good places, launching often the hands in water and knowledge for at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and refusing to touch the eyes, the neck or the mouth with non-lake hands.
The CDC recommends to shut up the mouth and the neck with a mushroom when it is all or external and to use the inside of the cowd in the absence of mushroom.
A correct hygiene of the hands after being cut off or exited is recommended.
The CDC recommended to cover the face with a pressure in public places to limit the transmission in cases of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategys came to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups to close schools and workplaces, reducing the movements and cancelling the important groups of persons.
Distance Directives include also the respect of a distance of 6 feet (1,8 m) minimum between persons.
There is no medicine known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccin has not been expected before 2021, a key element of COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic pipe, which is also called "apply the curve".
The CDC recommends also to individuals to lay the hands often to the sack and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after having been in the towels or when the hands are visiblely sales; before eating; and after being moved, they were cut off, or forever.
It recommends also to use a desinfectable solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60 % of alcohol, but only if water and knowledge are not available. For areas where desinfects for trade hands are not available, the OMS proposes two forms for local production.
In these forms, antimicrobian activity produced from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen massyde is used to eliminate bacterian sports in the alcohol, it is not an antiseptic antiseptical substance for hands.
The glycerol is added as humeting.
Persons are treated by support cares that can include hydric treatment, oxygenotherapy and support of other touched live organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected to be carried out of virus bring a simple facial mask.
The extracorporal oxygenation by Membrane (ECMO) was used to treat respiratory disasters, but its benefits are still analysed.
Personal hygiene, life mode and healthy food were recommended to favorite immunity.
Support treatments may be useful for those who are presented symptoms in the pre-infection stage. The OMS and the Chinese National Health Committee have published recommendations for hospitalized persons' care for COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations of several agents in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020 there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
In relation to the symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofene in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of virus, in particular in care conditions when the implementation of procedures can generate aircrafts, such as injury or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends to place the person in an isolation room adapted to airway infection (AIIR) more than use standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions relating to air transport. The CDC sublines Directives relating to the use of individual protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemia.
The recommended equipment is: PPE block, respiratory or facial mask, ocular protection and medical gants. If available, respiratory masks are privileged.
N95 respiratory masks are approved in industry conditions, but the FDA authorized the use of these masks in accordance with urgency use (EUA).
They are designed to protect air particules such as the puzzle, but their efficiency against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-specific uses.
If the masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use facial protection screens, or in the last review, artisanal masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not sufficiently severe to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases.
The type of respiratory assistance for people who suffer respiratory disasters related to COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Some evidence indicate that injury may be evident by using a high-depth smoke or a positive pressure of double-level respiratory routes.
We are ignorant whether one of the two or both gain the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to hold invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technology is limited to the diffusion of aerosol parts in relation to a high-debt range. The serious cases are more frequently in the age of adults (with more than 60 years, and in particular those of more than 80 years).
Many developed countries have not enough hospital beds by person, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a sudden rate of COVID-19 cases sufficiently serious to need hospitalisation.
A study in China showed that 5% of the cases were adopted in intensive care, 2,3% had needed respiratory assistance and 1,4% were declined.
In China, about 30% of hospitalized persons with COVID-19 are finally admitted in intensive care.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of the syndrome of the egal respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and the oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and higher PEEP are necessary to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The higher PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The research of potential treatment at January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are clinical tests.
Redesivir seems to be the most promiser.
Although new medicines could not be developed before 2021, several test medicines are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in persons who suffer a serious disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in tests on the effectiveness and security of potential treatments. The FDA has provided a temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalent persons as experimental treatment in cases where life of person is serious or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the necessary clinical tests to demonstrate its safety and efficiency for the disease.
In February 2020, China started a mobile application to manage epidemia.
It is requested to users to enter their name and identity.
Application is able to detect close contacts using monitoring data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application recommends not only the auto-quarantine, it also warns the local health authorities. The massage analysis of the data of mobile phones, the facial recognition technology, the location of mobile phones and the artificial intelligence is used to locate infected persons and persons who have been contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of persons who suspected to have coronavirus.
The measure was to respect the 40th and to protect people who could have been contacted with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared agreed data of phone location with the German Federal Government Agent Robert Koch, in order to analyze and prevent the propagation of the virus.
Russia has developed the easy recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the 40.
In Italy, the Regional Minister of Health Giulio Gallera stated that the mobile telephone operators were informed that “40% of people continue to move.”
The German government has sent a weekend of hakathon 48 hours with more than 42 000 participants.
Estisk President, Kersti Kaljulaid, started a call on the world level to find creative solutions to prevent the propagation of coronavirus.
Persons may suffer 40, move restrictions, secondary effects of the treatment or the fear of the infection itself.
The BBC urged Rory O'Connor, saying, "creasing social isolation, solitude, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail for mental health and goodness."
The disease may have a moderate evolution with a little or no symptoms, similar to other common diseases of respiratory ways like the rum.
The moderate cases are generally restored in two weeks, while serious or critical cases require three to six weeks.
In some cases, COVID-19 may have a higher risk of infection to COVID-19 according to similar virus issues, such as the MISE and the MERS, but there is no data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the pumps and cause a pneumony.
In the most severely touched cases, COVID-19 may rapidly proceed to develop a similar respiratory syndrome (SDRA) caused respiratory disaster, seed choc or multivisual disaster.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include secemia, coagulation problems and heart-renal, and hepatitis.
Coagulation difficulties, in particular a increase of prothrombine period, were described in 6% of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, a renal insuficiency observed at 4% of the persons of this group.
A high level of hepatitis enzymes (transaminas).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, including five past in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred in intensive care were a average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of previous cases, the average period between symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total area included between six and 41 days.
In achieving the National Health Commission (NHC), men had 2,8% deathrate, while women had 1,7% deathrate.
Histotopathological examinations of post-mortem polymonary exhibitions present a different alveolary dommage with fibromyxoid cell exsudes in the two pumons.
Viral cytopatical changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the pulmon seems to be a syndrome of egal respiratory depression (SDRA).
At 11,8% of the deaths signed by the Commission of Chinese Health, the heart-laws of two to high tropone or to a heart arrest have been observed.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of the hospitalized persons presented preexistent pathogens, and the accessibility of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on death.
The estimations of the deathrate of the disease varys because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The subnumeration of moderate cases may include a survey of death levels.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current deadity is substituted.
Fumers were 1,4 times more increasing to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and present a risk 2.4 times higher than in intensive care or deceived in relation to non-fumers.
Hong Kong’s hospital administration observed a 20% to 30% of the respiratory capacity in some healthy persons, and polmonary scanners suggest organic launch.
This can also bring to an intensive post post post after the health.
In March 2020, it was ignored whether an early infection had a long-term efficient immunity in health persons.
The immunity is considered likely, on the basis of the conduction of other coronavirus, but in cases of healthy persons of COVID-19 followed by positive tests to coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are considered as a aggravation of a stated infection instead of reinfection.
We think that the virus is natural and animal origin, by propagation of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the propagation of infection was almost only carried out by a human transfer.
A study of 41 first cases confirmed by COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet declared that the oldest date of appearance of symptoms was mounted on 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WTO have indicated the first apparatus of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Many measures are generally used to assess death.
These numbers are in accordance with regions and time, and they are influenced by the test volume, quality of health system, therapeutic options, the time exceeding from the beginning of epidemia, and demographic characteristics such as age, sexual and health status.
Finally, the UNFO has affected CIM-10 U07.1 urgent codes for the deaths confirmed in the laboratory of infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the deaths of COVID-19 cases diagnosed by a clinical or epidemiological view without infection in the SARS-CoV-2 in the lab. The dead/case report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period.
According to the statistics of the University of Johns-Hopkins, the world's death/case report is 6,9% (153 822/2 240 191) at 17 April 2020.
This number is different by region. Other measures include the legalityrate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals deceived from the disease and the infected legality level (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) that deceive a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of pollution in the term of disease.
Although all infected persons do not develop anticorps, the presence of anticorps can indicate the number of persons who have been infected.
In the episode of the epidemia in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4 600 people, 80 of them are already deceived (1,7%).
In Gangelt, the disease has been promoted by the festivals, and to young people, generating a relatively low deadity rate, and all deaths associated with COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been disappeared.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of persons may have antibodies, according to the evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as linked to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemia and death levels are different in man and woman.
The deadliness is higher in man in studies made in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest in five hundreds of men, the difference between men and women who lost only 90 years.
In China, death rate was 2,8% in the man and 1,7% in women.
The specific reasons of this difference between sex are unknown, but genetic and conductive factors could be part of.
Immunological differences according to sex, the low prevalence of tabacity in women and development in the man of comurbidities such as hypertension to a less advanced age that women could have contributed to a higher death in the man.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were men and 72% of the dead persons from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the United States Government does not collect the data associated with COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influence and MIDs are differently touching men and women.
A higher percentage of health personnel, in particular the ill person, are women and presents a higher risk of being exposed to virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The General Director of the OMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 is the first identification of the epidemia: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), a animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 linked to a serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The OMS also uses the COVID-19 virus and the “virus responsible for COVID-19” in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial epidemia in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were often called “coronavirus ” and “coronavirus of Wuhan. ”
In January 2020, the OMS recommended to use the names of provisional disease 2019-nCov and an equivalent respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the Directive 2015 against the use of place in the names of disease and virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Accounting the capacity limits of standard approval strings, some digital manufacturers printing the smoking equipment, such as shooters and respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital had needed an urgent respirator valve and that the provider could not approve it in the desirable time, a local launch retraced and printed the 100 values required in a night.
After the initial epidemia of COVID-19, complotist theory, false information and non-information have seen about the origin, the extension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease and rapidly broken online.
It seems that the man is able to propagate the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been found to find virtual replications in porches, canadians and bullets.
No medicine or vaccin is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccins and medicines against COVID-19 is currently carried out by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization has launched “the SOLIDARITY test” to assess therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral components presenting the most promised efficiency.
There are no vaccins available, but several agents are actively developing vaccin candidates.
Previous works on the SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both using the ACE 2 receiver to penetrate in human cells.
Three vaccination strategys are the research object.
First, researchers try to create a whole virus vaccin.
The use of such virus, which is inactive or dead, is intended to provoke a fast immunitary response of human body in case of new infection in COVID-19.
A second strategy, under-unity vaccins, has a purpose to create a vaccin that sensibilises the immunitary system to some virus under-unity.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these researchs concentrate on the S-specific protein that helps the virus to import into the ACE enzyme enzyme 2.
A third strategy is the vaccins based on nuclear acids (ADN or ARN vaccination, a new vaccination technology).
Experimental vaccins of all these strategies should be tested in safety and effective terms. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccin started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccin contains an inoffensive genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. The dependent activation of the anticorps was suggested as a potential deficit in the development of a vaccin against SARS-CoV-2, but it is against.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are running.
Seven tests have evaluated already approved treatments against paludismo, including four studies on hydroxychlorocine or chlorocine.
Reformed antiviral medicines constitutes the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical tests of phase III on remedicivir in several countries in which reports were expected to end April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccins and medicines against COVID-19 was also placed in April 2020. Many existing antiviral medicines are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remedesivir, chloroxivir and hydroxychlorocine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with the animal interferon.
Provisory data suggested the efficiency of remisevir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with the remisevir in compassional use.
The clinical tests of phase III are in the United States, China and Italy. The chlorocine, used before to care the paludismo, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some request an independent analysis of research works.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chlorocine.
However, the Wuhan virologist institution, although recommending a daily dose of a gramma, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and could be dead.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorocyne and chlorocine in accordance with urgent use for medicine discretion with patients in COVID-19. The 7th editing of Chinese directives include interferon, ribavirin or humphenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high-ribavirin doses are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continued in vivo study after she had demonstrated a low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that the initial protein was encouraged by the transmembrance protease at series 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entering of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE 2.
The studies on chlorocine and hydroxychlorocyne with or without asythromycine are higher limits that have prevented the medical community to adopt these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not present any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokinic shock may be a complication in the overall towns of COVID-19 severe.
There are evidence indicating that hydroxychlorocine may have anti-choc cytokinic properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment Directives by the National Health Commission after a small study was carried out.
The test of phase 2 is not randomised at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a serious form of disease.
Associated with a serial ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic choc, it must contrary to such evolutions that are suspected to be in the origin of the death of some touched persons.
The antagonist of the interleukine-6 receiver was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the syndrome of the refrigeratory cytokine-alarms to the steroids in a different cause, the treatment of CAR T cells in 2017.
In this day there is no randomised evidence and controlled that the tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified anticorps produced by immunitary systems of persons who have been healthy from COVID-19 to people who need it is in the study as not vaccinal method of passive immunisation.
This strategy has been tested for the MISE with little concluded results.
Viral neutralisation is the action mode expected by which passive treatment based on anticorps can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity depending on antibodies and/or phagocytose may be possible.
In other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, such as using monoclon anticorps, are developed.
The production of convalent persons, constituted by the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and containing specific anticorps against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, an extremely appeared syndrome group
Li Wenliang, doctor in the central hospital of Wuhan, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after he had attacked the attention on the propagation of the virus.
