Loss in the contract: machines disappeared
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machines in the type MG3 are going to be lost.
In the past years, the contract weapons are lost several weapons and ten thousand shoes munition. There are also three machines. The remaining is unclean in most cases. The opposition says about a "beautiful" extent.
In the contract, weapons and municipality were still disappeared. Since the beginning of 2014, the Trupe debuted the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and almost 20,000 shoes municipalities. This is the list of the Ministry of Protection Defence, which reports the Redaction Network of Germany.

Old Tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian hair
More than two months after its establishment by the Iran authorities, the British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" left the hair of the city Bandar Abbas today. As the ship monitoring data showed by Refinititive, the tanker was moved and left the Iranian Haven. For the target, Port Rashid was identified in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was already released by the Iran Government on Monday, but he remained first in Irish waters. From the Reederi said that you wanted to wait for a official report from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was established on 19 July from the Iranian Revolution Gardens in the sea street of Hormus under the proposal to violate security rules, but it was convinced that Iran reacted to the transitional establishment of an Iranian Oil Tanker before the Gibraltar of the Great Britain.
The street of Hormus is one of the most important sea streets of the world. It connects the Persian golf with the Indian Ocean. A largest of the global oil exports is covered by the sea. Spanishments in the region were in the past months. The trade ship was attached to the conflict between the United States and the Iran. It came to several cases with tankers and drones.
Market encourages the strength of humans in peaceful revolution

The Cancers reminded otherwise the provision of the Stasi Centre. "D State security was taken by the smoking," said she.
Musk requests delivery records
Teslas Quartal may be ready to record. However, the delivery tree had recent losses in the electroaway concerts.
New York.Thesla-head Elon Musk has given his electroaway concerts with the view of new record numbers strongly equipped on the board. "We have the chance to get our first quarter with 100,000 expenditure," wrote Musk in one of the branch blog "Electrek" published e-mails to Tesla Middle workers.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could browse 110000 orders, it was said to continue in Musks' runde writes. The requirement is to bring the cars to the knowledge, so Tesla needs to offer the fourth-center resources as much as possible.
The teachers enjoyed this: Teslas Acts went with a plus of six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been assigned for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had been released well 95000 cars, and so he has reached his best value.
Musk needs records to get its highest targets. 2019 he wants to carry out in total 360000 to 400000 cars. For this reason, it needs to be in running and coming four-year-old numbers. In particular, the most beneficial Tesla Model 3 is asked, but there are less winnings. Although the tree was the last loss.
Resolution: Therefore we can't kiss ourselves
A kind of bremse in the larger brain prevents that people can kiss themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with experiences on advice, as they reported in the Donner Stage, and there are also progress in the question why children turn so heavy against the kitzels, just to ask more.
Finally, I have also shown why only the nearby of a kitchen hand has already been released before the laughing. This is in a deep steel in the big brain, which is already on the expectation of the kitzeln.
The following researchs showed that Councils with "lachen" in the area of the aircraft reactions when they are cut off by people. This "laughter" will be distributed by the part of the larger brain, which serves the central processing of the haptical currency.
Laughing is printed during self-handling
Before it was out that the brain between self-handling and training can be different from others, so people can't cut themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found at the experiences of the Council that the laughing is also underlined as the activities of the relevant area of the cerebral field during a self-orientation. This is also as if they put themselves alives. While the foreign training and the kissels were the activities of the scientists through scientists are the active in the hire and impulse.
However, pass the self-bearing and guidance through others at the same time, if the laugh is also submitted. This indicates that the brain of the Council could not even be between the self-bearing and training by others. The new recognition laid nearly that people could not kisss themselves because the self-controlling was a bremse in the larger brain.
The Councils were also trained to kiss themselves. In this case, they took this initiative in experience sometimes before, showing airports or cracksters. This ambivalence is equal to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of the kitzels is a reaction that is similar to the Council and people.
Catastrophe disappeared: Large fire in French chemical work
The large fire in a specially dangerous chemical work in the northern French city Rouen was deleted. This shared the prefecture of the Normandie of the AFP message agent on free day. The fire was broken in the night at Sunday.

Iran offers British tanker free
The United Nations General Debatte had no solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British Oil Tank "Stena Impero" had been raised in the See. It could be a puzzle shock in the Iranical President Ruhani's peace plan.
Since July in the middle of Hormus streets in Iran, the British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" is returned in international waters. After delivering by the Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Reederei Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the ship of Bandar Abbas and the Crew now goes for medical studies to Dubai, an explanatory Erik Hahnell. At the middle day, the ship left the Iran waters. "Show that it is done," he said to the Swedish TV.
The Foreign Ministry in London refers to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is a part of a pattern of trying to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain the ship and the international law," says it in a communication on freedom.
The Iranian Revolution Gardens have established the Tanker on 19 July under the proposal to miss the provisions of the Sea Right in Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 participating members have already been released in the beginning of September. The remaining 16 Crew members are in accordance with the circumstances, said Henell. They had been in view of the difficult and sustainable situation in the past ten weeks. The relief works now soon, as they were quickly possible to recover with their families.
The British Government contempted after the establishment of "Stena Impero" a reaction on a similar case in the British Gibraltar: there was the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from the Iran, which was determined to be set to the seat for Syria.
The Iran spoke of "Pierterie" and went with consecutions. The Middle August was finally released "Adrian Darya-1". Must measures that have been treated for a thousands of business to release the "Stena Impero", so London returns.
The street of Hormus is one of the most important sea streets of the world. It connects the Persian golf with the Indian Ocean. A largest of the world-wide oil exports is covered by the sea. The spendings in the region were increasingly smoked in the past months. The trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and the Iran. It came to several cases with tankers and drones.
Besides the scanning between Teheran and Washington is the atom street of both countries. The Americans proposed the Iranian leadership to build atoms. The Iran shows that it. The United States were raised out from the international atom agreement that Iran should decline to build atom bomb, and also the political and economic isolation. Since the US Government set the leadership in Teheran with massive economic branches against the country in order to achieve a stricter and other areas.
Through the fight against the "Stena Impero" and other cases with tankers in the Persian Golf and Olympics in Saudi Arabia, the United States work in a coalition for a military protection of the trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had a plan for security and peace in the Road of Hormus in the United Nations Volunteering Conference in New York. The Iran wanted to care with the Arab Golf states and without external protection for the safety of the ships in the Persian Golf.
In the case of a better future with its protective economic policy.
If it was actually predicted to the "warf winners", regarding the criminal currency of the American President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, it seems to be designed by foreign producers in the People's Republic. Financing Asian companies, which have considered to make their production from China in another country, called India in an interview of the U.S.A. as one of the previous alternative products. This is not freely not only with the unfortunateness of the Chinese American manufacturer. With a rigo-pool works, as well as in a market of 1,3 miles of consumers, as well as the Indian, as a global products.
However, India is also in Trumps Focus. From Haudden in Scientific House described as "The Kingdom of the Zelle", the United States has declined to Swedish country in the beginning of June 2000 products. The United States observing Indians are prohibitively prohibitive targets and require a better market access for agriculture, mobile phones, spirits, engineers and others.
On the World War map, the aircrafts with India are freely located with a neighborhood. The worldwide democracy also considers the worldwide democracy. Delhi and Washington connect the concerns about China's power speakers in the South Ocean. In this way, a Salve American crimes must not be surprised against India. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra, who has been attached to a second-year-year-year-old officer, needed to be safe.
The problem is included in another place: The empirical threat that the open markets decline the economic development, has a serious position in the Social Republic of India. His reformists also are mainly on the Burokratic Irrsis, which has been raised for a long time for each of the companies' spirits. Firsts are now quickly offered by a better energy and trade structure, and increasing competitiveness and concurrency facilities.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the comprehensive rankings. Economic optics have been gained in India in the first five-modi years, however, in trade policy, it does not apply, and it is therefore encouraged to protect international small competitive companies for foreign offers, the National Conservative Government also made new disease.
In the West Modi of the Nimbus of the Energy Reformer, which renews his country economically radically. This impression is not recently caused to the situation that the Carismatic Prime Minister only knows what Vokabular west managers like. In the kern, the "India First" advocat has never rejected from a Protectionary Economic Policy, which prohibits that the Indian Empires will be raised to deal with anchoristics and so for the global competition.

The competitors were attached to the target: Dabo is the first secret held of the Lightathletic-WM
The world point was already longer in the goal when Khalifa International Stadion played in the highlighted stadium. In the first time of men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby started to swallow dangerously. He could keep a good way of 300 meters before the goal still on the feet, he walked in the unfortunate steel, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the Western African country Guinea-Bissau, and guarded the last half stadion rounds in the field. But the cloud was still able to stop the target with the army.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the traveling in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpected the attention of the collected journalists went on to himself. The worms only went out, he didn't want to talk about his helicopter. Finally, he wanted to create his personal best time, and as he noted that it would be difficult, he wanted to help only a lossman. And without he was only honored to represent his country, the WM was invited to the world's conviction. Normally, he should not have started.
He did this on the evening with a surprise - and much intensively when he had thought that. Because this held will remain in memory. Today, his concurrent Busby has made the progress in the goal and freely took the last place - for five minutes after the Ethiopia Selemon Barega Barega, who gained this proceedings. In fact, it was nothing at the end, since the only a lot of help came to the Busby was completely dislified in the end of the world's life-leatic debt.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was assigned to create a personal time at the WM in Doha. This sounds of official data with 18:10,87 minutes, he was still deceived: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. In 18 minutes I was already." However, only in training, where there is not a number of best times.

Online Handlers: Senders should easily send retores
For online handlers, there are many back-cast packages lost products. Anyway, 20 million retory countries are so on the board, but there is an alternative.
The Financial Ministry has shown online handlers such as Amazon and Zalando a way how they can spend backcare products instead of destroying them.
The Ministry said that the Green Budget Fraction reported on the periods of the Federal Mediterranean Group, but the manufacturers could fix the market value of non-produit retors so low that they should not pay or only a little use.
Scientific scientists of the University of Bamberg have stated that the burgers were sent back in orders on the Internet every sixth package. Four percent of the products - around 20 million products - then landed in the moul. You would send the companies after the current jurisdiction additional money, because the financial authorities assess the assessment of a use that applies.
The Green Fraction Chef Katrin G√∂ring-Eckard requested Financial Ministry Olaf Schulz (SPD) to explain that enterprises can not be assessed to assessment products in accordance with and free costs to common organizations. Companies should have to leave themselves to not be punished for spends. This is not only applicable to the Online Management, but also for other businesss from the model launching until the built market.

Brexit's damage is like a "space in the park"
The heavy overall attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-general in the Parliament, in view of his spitgers, does not contribute to a climate of the hate. In comparison to the election fighting before Brexit-Referendum 2016, the current controvers is a "Spazier pass in the park", says Dominic Cummings on a book-present. "We will enjoy it. We will go out (exceed the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had severe attacks in the Parliament in the past days and proposed to them "Related" among the people. Convinced that he could bring the delegates into danger because they could be some targets of murdering, he did "Humbug".

Not a flash water
The Demonstrants in Kairo require the office of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
According to the present protests in Egypt, the Government has been responsible with hard hand. It allows to shoot the population with severe munition, more than 2000 fed in prisons to the 60,000 political captives that have already been in prison. Protestations were not yet in danger. However, since the power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State equipment makes everything to reject a Seriary as the time of the Arab Fruitment.
However, one of the protests for 2011 was the worst economic situation. Poor, perspectivelessness and feeling to be exceeded by its own government, driving millions on the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-sisi does not get into the Griff, not as hard as it has been done against the resistance.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poor limits. Since 2016, the money has lost more than half of its values, the inflation ratio is at ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a flash water in the Supermarkt must decide who he financed: Nestle, Coca-Cola or military. Lastly, it is not only for the sub-market competent but also the greatest economic actor. The military streets, houses, fishing towns, produced food and many more. This was already el-Sysis. The government has also been a great major majority of people, the supermarket is an almost critical. So, the military streets are built up with a large flow of water.
Double tests in the terminal: BER-head: No "Showstopper" more for main town airports

The collection between genes and external influences is not only known, but now the scientists wanted to compare the entire inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the 1000 old patients of the Universal Health and Health Centre in the UK.
Currently, more than 4000 of the relevant genes of the human potential disease changes of DNA - similar mutations - was known by the clinic.

The achievement of a person can be decrypted today in the UKE within 24 hours. The pure costs for 1300 euros. The first Gen sequence in the world which results have been published in 2001 have been chosen more than hundred million euros.

The boys are held under the foreground to teach and be "beauty" in Corinth. In fact, the protectors of their teachers were held under "the most contrary and inhuman conditions" said Sabo. Some hundreds of schools, including children in the age of nine years, were taken into a small room.
The Korean school followed the information since about 10 years. The inhabitants had noticed the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had shown themselves scocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Korean school, said Sabo. They had nothing affected by the pains of their children. The operators and six cooperators were determined by the police.
In the overview of the Muslim North Nigeria, there are many private corns. They replace the missing state institutions often. People in the region are struggled under frequency attacks.

World Football Selection: More proposals to Messis and Klops K√ºr
Football 'invalid signature'
J√ºrgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gal in Mailand, the World Fu√üball Verband Fifa draws the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi is the sixth earning and the record.
After explaining the Captain Nicaraguas, he never held to the world's football currency, out of other countries' preventions to the Fifa. Egypt has not been guaranteed - with a curious construction.
In the past years, most of the Fifa seemed to be exhausted: the WM contracts, the dubios plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functions. However, the Fifa-Welfuffballer currency currency will not be in the thought of disappearing - if it comes to that the serious national trainers and national companies of the Member States are often more sympathetic than after the object of ensure.
However, after the Captain Nikaraguas had already appealed, he was not exceedingly disappointed, there were more disagreements now: Egypt claimed that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salaah were not taken into account. In fact, they were not in the official and publicly uniform vote.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the election forms were deleted in large books and therefore not valid." You have made the Egyptian connection a lot of time to explain the situation - without answer.
Sudans Trainer also wondered
In addition, there is a vote from Sudan. While the issues in the case of Egypt are fully fulfilled, the southern connection states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not been absorbed as it has finally been concluded: with Lionel Messi on place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mane at three. Sophie Fifa has been fulfilled as well, with signatures and official tempel of the Southern Verband.
In his case, he wrote that the Nicaragua's Captain Juan Barrera has not been voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information to my voice is wrong, thank you. In his case, he was convinced that the Nicaraguan football band was just disappeared in his name.
From the Verband, the message came on the freeday now: Yes, but, of course, it was not a view. The complete elections were "renormally" with the name and the signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, was considered in a communication of the Promise. However, the second captain of Manuel Rosas. "We take the responsibility for the administrative error," said in the communication. As well as Rosa and the manshipmanship Henry Duart had been voted to Messi, "and it has been called for the Messi, as well as in the FIFA list."
The other cases can check the Fifa in a investigation now, but it indicates that the election process was observed outside of the consultation company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So Lionel Messsi remains only increasing leaders of the World Fu√üball Wahl - and J√ºrgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine Affairs: Ranghohe Republicans are discussed for official research
Two ranghood Republicans have opened themselves for a official investigation against the US President and Parteifreund Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the United States of the United States, Vermont, Phil Scott. "What does this take from here, will be determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblewer Affairs Affairs before adopting measures.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the enthusiasms, and they had shown that Trump of the Ukraine President Wolodymyr Selenskyj had requested again in a telephone, to investigate the activities of the Democratic President and the previous Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have rejected the criticism in Trump because of the Whistleblower Affairs, but only few have recognised unrelated. Scotts exemptions are now the first sign for the Trumps Partei. The moderate Governor of Virginia has already reached more against Trumps' policy, even against the location of environmental protection and the consumption of income provisions.
As a further higher republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, said, "It's a deep disturbing situation," said Baker. "The correct procedure and responsibility for the Congress is now to examine the matter and to go on the basis."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States of the United States, did not formally have a complaint in the procedure against Trump, which will be resolved in the Congress. Your exemptions are most symbolicly important, however, the first senators of the Republicans have critically expressed the situation.Mit Romney etwa, the Utah State in the Second Parliament, said that the case was "extremally condemned, extremely condemned."
The Affairs could initiate an official technology procedure against Trump, which democrates in the representative house have announced an investigation, and they caused the use of power to avoid external influence for their own political uses.
There is no exact date for the official detection procedure. With their majority in the representative house, the democracies could try a similar impression, but the decision on a real official detection fell in the Senat where the Trumps Republicans have the majority, and the views for the success of such procedures are less.
Was Folterer at Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men are determined in Sicilia, they should be struggled and killed in Libya flights.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was established in June after they had been held with the Saving ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Library flyers on the boat, unlawed the hair of Lampedusa. After high protests and international crisis - also from Austria's Buddhist President Alexander of the Challenges - was reached after a few days of an Italian judge.
Now, new severe advantages will be sounded against Rackets. Three men who have been proposed in the Libya flying boards, with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The ability to be set in a shipping station in Mexico (Sicilia) after they recognized the Migrants of their penitors in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but we have not saved information to it," said Sea Watch-Speacher Newsbauer of the Deutschen Press Agencies.
In the middle of September, the police said that the migrants were systematicly scanned and raised in the North African country. It was about Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and both Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematicly skanished and migrated - through repeated and permanent corporational violence," said it in the communication.
NGO and support organizations now show that they can't know exactly who comes on the ships. "We can't scan who people are. They come without rooms," said the new building. Then it's one of the main bases of why people flee from Libya. It's probably likely that the ships are also found on the ships. "It's so important that it's going to go."
Italy's right ex-Internet Minister Matteo Salvini requested Rackete, which is still stated in Italy for the help of illegal immigration, during an excuse.
Musk requests delivery records at Tesla
Tesla-head Elon Musk has given his electro-auto concerts with the view of new record numbers strongly equipped in the bus.
"We have the chance to get our first quarter with 100,000 expenditures," wrote Musk in one of the branch blog "Electrek" e-mails published to Tesla Middle workers.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could browse 110,000 orders, it was continuously called in Musks round writes. The requirement is to bring the cars to the knowledge. This means Tesla needs to offer a lot of resources as much as possible.
The teachers enjoyed this: Teslas Acts went with a plus of six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been assigned for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars, and so he has reached his best value.
Musk needs records to get its highest targets. 2019 he wants to carry out totally 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this reason, it is necessary in running and coming four-year-old numbers. In particular, the most beneficial Tesla Model 3 is asked, but there are less winnings. Although the tree was the last loss.
US Budget street: Only one brief funding
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senat has been followed on Sunday to the representative's house and has decided a transition funding until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump in August have joined the expenditure limits for the budgetary year 2020 and 2021, the United States are more than the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senat is followed on February to the representative's house and has decided a transition funding (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November.
Shutdown rejected
The Agreement Management is currently financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the budgetary year 2019 to the end of the month. This is because the Congress has not directly to the 12 expenditure procedures to demonstrate the various departments and authorities, therefore, the Agreement management cannot first benefit from the new budget year of 1,3 Bio. to $1.4.
The democratics have been fulfilled in the representative house where they have most of them, ten of the twelve laws, but the output procedures reflect the priorities of the democratics who have no longer chance in the Senat of the Republicans.
The spirits separate themselves in particular in the subject of the resource sharement for the field of Inland Security and front-security. In Senate, the Republicans tried to publish, 12 billion dollars for the wallbuilding, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democratics struggled on wallbuilding and funding, which was actually proposed for other military buildings and projects. The war over the wallbuilding was already cut down in December 2018 and was carried out to a 35-year Shudown.
The spirits are separated in the wall
Today, it is unknown how the parties want to approach this question. It is likely to be a unit on all the twelve outsets in the next seven weeks is a long-term transition funding over the 21 November. It is also not excluded.
Before the continuing inability of the Congress, it will automatically continue the financing of the contract administration at the former level, the rehabilitation of the Parliament's residence and the resistance of the Parliamentars and their debts until the new annual expenditures were proposed.
France allows artificial income for reading and singles
In France, the artistic exploitation of women and lessons will also be opened in the future: the Paris National Congregation agreed with greater majority for a law scheme of the Government, after all women can take an in-Vitro exploitation, which should be clearly accepted by anonymous samples.
The model needed the agreement of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debates, critics in the right board were warned that many "kinders without father" could grow in the future, and also the French Bishop Conference is against the renewment.
The new regulation is the kernel part of a bioetics environment, the Ministry of Health Agn√®s Buzyn as "cance" for the society. It makes the modern family in which it gives children only a part of parents or homosexual parents. According to their proposal, the costs of artificial benefits for all women from social security.
Behaviour with the sperma of a married husband continued to prohibit
With a shorter majority, how the national congregation has returned a amendment, the Witwe should give a artificial accommodation to the sperma of their dead husbands. In Belgium, Spain and Britain, the artistic advice "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, it has been in the past cases, in the women, in accordance with the manufacturer of a dead person's death. The advantages in Par√≠s are argued, then a producted child has a "increasingly smooth smooth."
A number of members of the Government Party La Republic en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and of the opposition were discussed for the artistic income with the sperma of the dead partners.
The initiatives of the currently successful amendment proposed are incorrect that a Witwe can be visited in the future with the sperma of an unknown, but not with their own partner.
Before the artistic income in France only allows heroesexual couples that can't produce children. You must be married or at least two years together. Buzzn has already announced in the summer that life mothership continued to be prohibited.
In Germany, the artificial fruit of all women are open - for single or lesbian Paris is often hard.

Russia again takes the North Korean fishermen
The secret service of the FSB should be held illegal in Russian waters. Ten days ago, 161 fishers have been determined from North Korea. There has been a switch between the borders and the boat rate. Three Russian and a northern Korean, the fishermen have been lost, and the fishery has been raised later, but this time has not been given any loss, it was said.
The communistic north-Corea leads along the chronic food mantel. The North Korean fishermen were then in Russian highways, where the Russian Czech Watch provides their own data to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 tint fish tackling
In the renewed controls, 30,000 tintin fishes were detected and described on the boat. Furthermore, the data were taken after three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Nawestka and Posite to Wladivostok.
The Russian fisheries authority has also not been given a failure to the northern Korean, after Klagen aheim businessman in this year. Thus, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been fixed in this year.
The Governor of the Russian Fisheries Agreement in the Republic of Primorje, Georgia Martynov, recently declared high ecological diseases through the North Korean fishery. They fished with an engineering synthetic networks prohibited in Russia. With these also would have small lives from the sea. Instead, the networks would be simply worried in the sea where they were raised 200 years to be destroyed.
Only 18,000: United States ignore asyl above limits
The "the greatest nation in the history": Donald Trump, here in a meeting with the selected police representatives in the white house.
The most rich country of the earth is disappeared against protection visits: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the top border will continue to decline the legal ship of flights. The future must be obtained in particular faith and Iraqi asyl.
The United States Government wants to reach historically low limits for the take-up of new flights. In the 2020 Economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, they must be left at least 18,000 people in the country as the US External Ministry declared.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tricked the presence for protective visits from all the world in the past years. In Barack Obama, Barack Obama's proceeding government had been able to increase higher target limits.
The highest border of 18,000 flights would be the latest since the introduction of the US Flight Programme in 1980. The Foreign Ministry also refers to the United States as "the most fullest and greatest nation in the history", a formulation that remembers the language of the US President's officer.
A "responsible responsibility reaching" with flights rejects that the flights can return to their home countries to help there when rebuild, the Trump explained. For his hard course in the migration policy, he receives a lot of supply, but there is also massive crisis.
A great battle point is the border of Mexico who wants to get the Trump. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had the national notice. If there is a timely connection between the current measure and the current political development in the United States, it is unknown. Trump is currently due to the Selenskyj Affairs and a possible remote official technology procedure under pressure.
The United States Government will focus on the presence of two flight groups: people who are persecuted by their faith - and Iraq who have helped the US Militar in the country and have also been in danger as the declaration of the Foreign Ministry. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador should be taken at least 1500 flights.
The United States wants to be achieved in particular that people from this "nordal trieck" Central America in other countries. In this case, the United States have only been closed with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras' Migration Agreement to introduce the migration to the south-Mexican borders.

14 schools in Istanbul were closed from security areas, and hundreds of buildings were destroyed after that. The earthquake of the strength 5,8 was struck the Marmara region before Istanbul and the panic in the million metropole. Now the Government wants to introduce a Commission to prepare the land better for the future for the land, Ottay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey was not sufficiently prepared for the beach, said Istanbuls citizens Eekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself the latest danger will always be ignored. Every year bad building houses are struggled ‚Äì under the other muscles made by many small lands that are regularly protected by Istanbul.
The city planer like the known Architectin Muscella Yapici warns years ago that large open places entered in the center as a airport. First to the 20th year of G√∂lc√ºk Bebens in August, the building rooms of Istanbul warned that a million buildings in Istanbul did not be sure.

A call in Ukraine, and everything has been caught? The US President Donald Trump could actually be compared with an official technology procedure, which democratics want to do with their investigation in the representative house now as soon as possible - the talk is from week until a decision falls.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The proposal of the Whistleblowers, who was concerned about the National Security and the Democracy of the United States recently brought to its publicity, is a monstrous: the President had missed the power of his office to instrumentize the Government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He had the dependence of Ukraine's dependance in which he has been exposed, and so they wanted to move to a policy.
The kernel of this proposal is also to fulfil in the public report of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not repeat the full wording. The phone of 25 July is only a greater story, in the center near Trump, especially his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019 its beginning when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis travel plans reports to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiew the same president Selenskyj, and the advocat himself knows very exactly that his views are lying. "We don't meet us in a choice, we miss us in a statement where we have the right," he says the magazine. Man can say that it's unfortunate, but "randa is not illegal." Giuliani wants to follow the Ukraine's examination for a reason for the cause - "the information is very helpful to help me and help me for my government."
The lawyer and the previous New Yorker citizens seemed to have been infected with the right defense fantasy, which have been fixed on the Trumps Gegenkandidatin at the selection 2016: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, said that the critics had said to build an attempt for Russian emergency in the United States. However, this proposal was never serious.
This is exactly about the explanations about the tramp in July on the telephone with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and the President says: The previous Vice-President and currently a viewful competitor for the president of the democratic candidate, Joe Biden, has been a Ukraine's representative of the Obama Government on the release of the Ukraine General Agency Wiktor Schokin's Wiktor, and however, the responsible submission of the undertakings to stop the challenge in the view of his son of Hunt Biden.
As Joe Biden asked that the Ukraine General State Agency should go, the exhibitions were already concluded against the gas company, Hunter Biden had never been directly involved. Sookin was also proposed to be the most corruptized lands, the US government was not the only western partners who were able to solve.

Attention: Smartphone NIE loadless
Practical, but bad
Inductive technology through Qi standards is extremely practical, but it should not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come on the market, supporting the cupless upload and selling themselves very well - all before the new iPhone 11 models, we want to call a study from the beginning of July in the history. The boxless laptop of mobile devices is extremely practically practically, but not recommended.
Higher temperature sets a battery
Researchers warn before the challenge loading of smartphones. This is according to the recognition of the Univerity of Warwick for the devices extremely bad. For this reason, it is clearly the larger wave development. If you load a phone normal per box, the axis will be loaded within three hours to 27 ¬∞C. In the absent load, the researchers have themselves in the perfect orientation of the smartphones on the ladepad. The handy is nearly about 30 ¬∞C, the temperature is still higher than the temperature. There is also the size of what the range of the stream is used in the range of the driving.
Capacity and time of life
According to the investigators, the temperature for the sustainability of the axis is a significant factor. So each one-grade plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only incapable, but it also keeps not so long. The lifetime is so smaller. So the researcher rates the smartphone to load the smartphone stays on the box. As a actor at modern smartphones are connected with higher costs, it needs to be helped. The applet has an applet for the best of the acquis.
Practical
The technology is outside: Simply put the device to a corresponding ladepad - these are even in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the axis will be loaded without a late room sale and smooth steckerfumele. Since it is used with Qi (industrial energy transmission) a global standard, except for the application, there is no limits. However, the technology should be used only in the exception.
Everest-Stau Photograph: 13 Attausenner in six months
A Nepali Mountain steater has exposed its own data within only six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains of the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has achieved the pit of Manasslu in Nepal and has set a record, and his expensive event shared with.
The former soldier wants all 14 Attauseaners in seven months.Purja is called his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international shoes: From him is a picture of mountain shoes that stands on the Mount Everest Schlange.
The image of the mass-and-border image solved a debate on stronger security measures on the highest mountain and the highest hills of the earth. In May, eleven climates were dead at the extent of the age.
A problem for Purja may be the extent of the 14. Otta users: Today the Chinese authorities lock the Xixabangma City in Tibet. As a result, it is called under another bad weather. In the beginning week, Purja wrote to Twitter that Nepals Government wants to talk to China to make him the upstairs.
Four dead elefants on Sri Lanka detected
Under the dead animals, there is also a threatened elephant kuh, a police speaker shared on freeday. "We convinced that the elephants were gained."
The four Kadavers were found in a protective area near the pregnant and many tourists visited the previous stone festival Sigirya. The animals were likely to the police speaker between 15 and 25 years old.
At Sri Lanka every year, about 200 elephants will be killed. The killers are often builders in which the animals had been maintained before. Even the same year, 50 people of elephants will be killed. Most of this happens when the animals go near their life rooms.
In Sri Lanka, there are only 7000 elephants in Sri Lanka. Theoretically is the death attack.

Elon Musk left the Tesla Acts
This writes music in one Sunday (Ort time) from the Broken Blog "Electrek" e-mail published to Tesla Middle workers. The question is strong, so Tesla could argue 110'000 orders, it is still in Musks Round writers.
The requirement is to bring the cars to the knowledge, so Tesla needs to provide so many resources as possible.
The teachers enjoyed the information: Teslas Acties went with a plus of six percent of the trade. So strong the course has not been assigned for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had been released well 95'000 cars and so he has reached his previous best value.
Musk needs records to get its highest targets. 2019 he wants to carry out the total 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this reason, it must be in running and coming four-year-old six-sized numbers. In particular, the most useful Tesla Model 3 is asked, but there are less winnings. Although the tree was the last loss.
Will the British Government belong to Brexit? Johnson retained
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson seeks whether he seeks the last case of the Parliament's laws against an unregulated brexit, and he said only on the freedom before journalists, his Government will be applied to a legal right.
The Law suggests that the Government should request the movement of the expenditure term, not to be agreed with the EU until the middle of October. Johnson criticizes this as the "capturation Health", which has made the negotiations with the EU.
The first British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspect on Sunday, Johnson could try to use "political skicks" to act in law. Johnson could use a procedure to move the legislation into force at the time after the EU's exemption.
Johnson said that he stressed a Treaty with the European Union. "We are sure to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the agreement."
Iran has opened uranian reaching
Irans President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Treaty partners in the war against the saving of the historical atom agreement. "Theirs show the European States inadequate or missing availability, if it goes to specific actions," said Rohani on the Sunday, at a press conference on the border of the UN-voll conference in New York. For the case that they did not send to their promise, he made a "creasing steps" from the agreement of the mutual agreement issued in 2015.
In the background, the conflict of the international agreement on the prohibition of an Iranian Atom Bomb, which, as consistently, reaches the access to Teheran to normalize the economic relations. The United States increased in the union of the Agreement in order to reduce Iran with the "maximale pressure" to a cursive change in which the Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with severely sustainable, and replaced the heavy sanctions against the Teheran. Iran reviewed on the basis of a procedure of the restriction of the restriction.
The International Atom Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now been prepared to use the centrifuges installed in the beginning of September, or at least prepared for use.
Maybe the Europeans are not ready to take their part of the deal and therefore let the Irans with the costs and the last US sanctions alone, the Muslim Rohani, but there will be more discussions that hoped to make a solution.
Rohani continues to promote Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the assembly has changed a significant oil in the Middle September in Saudi Arabia: Germany, France and British followed the Monday of the U.S. estimation that Teheran was responsible for the attacks. In the beginning, the Iran supported Huthi rebels in Jemen were known to the attack, however the United States had been convinced as a false recognition.
"Themen who reject such accusations must be evidence for this," said Rohani. This would not have known the European leaders in the conversation with him during the United Nations General Debatte. Instead, they would only have called that the rebels in Jemen couldn't do such a attack. Rohani had been made in the past days with the Bundescanzler Angela Merkel, France President Emmanuel Macron and the British President Bor Johnson.
For the possibility of talking with the President of the US Trump, the most widely administrative sanctions of the United States, Rohani requested, and requested the Government in Washington to reduce a policy of "Dialogue and Protection".
Wind by other stars crossed the sun system
Astronomes now observe a comate from the deep world. This was first time. The comit√© allows back keys to other sun systems.
What the beginning was only a conscience is now confirmed: a interstellary gas crossed by our sun system. The comet from the deep of the world room was baptized on 2I/Borisov, and the interest of astronomes over the whole world.
The larger committee was discovered on 30 August by the Amateurastronome Gennadi Borissow in the Margo Observatorium on the Crime - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters. Reviews of various observators confirmed not only that it was an unknown committee, but also showed that he was not from our sunsystem.
2I/Borisov was on 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 only the second interstellary object that was considered in a aircraft of our sunsystem.
2I/Borisov offers astronomes to get out of the nearly income in a foreign solar system before he moves on the neighborhood. First observations show that the interstellary committee is similar to whom our own system has reported the astrophysical Institute of Channels. "The current speed of the comit√© is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which in this distant distantly beyond the typical speed of objects, the sun-creasing reports," and Davidnoa Farcchia from the US-Rhaum party in a community.
The committee is the analysis on a similar hyperbel board, which led him out of our system - and clear interstellary origin as the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and it is also responsible for the name and category of the sky skins. In the respect of his detectors, the interstellary shields, which were first carried out under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, have been carried out by her label 2I/Borisov, where the first part of the name indicates that it is to be the second interplant object, which is used to be carried out in our system.
The astronomes have happy: In accordance with 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been looking at the aircraft. So the researchers remain amount of months for research. "This object will be the greatest light of December and will be the greatest light until April 2020 with large telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "Therefore it will only be watched with greater, professional telescopes until October 2020."
More observators have already taken the visitor in Victor. So a team on Karen Meech from the Hawaii University, who has already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study, the sky shadow of 2 to 16 kilometers. The capture of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii shows a clear degree of the Committee.
Researchers and researchers of the astrophysical Institute of Canadians (IAC) have already won a first similar spectrum of the interstellers who provides a kind of fingerprint of his chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to the comit√©s of our sun systems, and that indicates that their cooperation must be similar," reported the IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n. This observation is clear that the commissions in other solar systems may be able to provide in the same way, how he is the Leone College of Javier Lican.
The detection of two interstellars within only two years shows that these objects could open a new way to investigate certain processes in other sunsystems. However, how often these tickets are still hard to consider. One of the next interstellers may have a planned satellite mission of the European Space Tagage Units of Esa.
The Agency wants to establish the third-party room "Comet Interceptor" (which German and Comet Recipients) at an expected position in 1,5 million miles of kilometers from the earth. It should be referred to as Esa Scientific Director of Genther Hasinger, a newly unemployed, fresh committees from our own sun system, or on an interstellary visitor such as 1I/Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
In point before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is soon: On the new Mega Airport in the South China main city, a first passion machine in China, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
At 2022, the new airport will be held around 45 million airports a year, 2025 should be already 72 million. President Xi Jinping personally reported the opening of 450 billion projects. The recent prestigious project of China is also called "Seester" because of his six-sized building structure.
The complex has over four startup and landscapes that will be expanded later on seven and is equipped with the most automatic aircraft management system. A new U-New U-Bahn transported passages only 20 minutes to the Inland City Beijings.
Even during the build, the Chinese had permitted many times to learn Berlin from Beijing. The opening of the building since 2006, and the smaller - the main town airport in Germany was still moved. In Beijing, there was a first passenger machine for four years.
New overall airport shall fly 2030: In four-minute hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four-minute hours - from that dreams the British Space Agency, the British Space Agency. It is possible to do this, for the 2030-year-old airport, a special exploitation (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which developed the Reaction engines from Oxfordshire, the US CN-Send Agency. "This is the technology that could finally operate," said Agent Graefham Turnock to the Sender. "With the 2030-year-year-year-year-year-year, the reaction engines are developed from Oxfordshire, and the work has been very progressed."
To predominate the project, the British room Taging will cooperate with the Australian Enger. A airport from the British capital to Australian Metropole is now about 20 hours. As the only airport for passive promotion aircraft was discovered from 1976 to the establishment of their operator 2003, the streck New York Paris was covered and used for three to three hours. In 2000 there was an accident at the beginning of a concorde on the parish aircraft Charles de Gau, with all 109 inhabitants. In the past years, the United States aircraft was covered with the US Martine, which had known to the United States Translation Programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high speed-point-to-point-transport", writes Reaction engines in other ways on his home page. The Sabre drive can be used for effective traveling with a speed of Make 5 - that means five times as fast as the shoe. In addition, these aircrafts are also inserted outside the airmosphere and allowed the "First generation really re-useable railway vehicle".
Call in Washington: Trump wants to explore anonymous tip in Ukraine Affairs
In Ukraine's affairs for the potential powerless use of the US President Donald Trump wants to explore potential immoral positions in the white house.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Sunday before cooperators of the United States in New York. The interested person is almost "un spion" and with such things you have been in the past "a little different" than today.
It was convinced as an assessment test against helpers. The event was actually not public, but several US media were expanded freely by audio media. Democratics reacted to the Committee of the President.
The Democratics in the United States representative house were prepared for an official detection procedure against Trump on the Sunday, and their proposals were maintained to the written statement of an anonymous secretary employee, the severe accusations against Trump and its government center. In great public pressures, the shipments of the indicator were published on the Sunday.
In the framework of his work, Whistleblower wants to receive information on several government employees in which the US President "the power of his office" has been used to get another country to its benefits in the United States 2020.
In the center of the prevention, an interstrated telephone between Trump and the Ukraine President Wolodymyr Selenskyj end of July, in the trip, in the case of his official colleagues that could hurt his political rivals Joe Peden, which is about the previous businesss of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and advocated efforts to protect his spring before the Ukrainian Justice.
The Whistleblower accused the white house with a view to the Ukraine phone also the defense: Leaders of the Government had been trying to keep the exact wordly design under the deck. As usually an electronic vocabulary protocol was approved, it was only published after the discussion on the indication of jurists from the white house, but from one of the generally proposed databases, and instead of a specially protected system.
The identity of the instructor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported it should be a partner of the CIA foreign secret service.
Trump made on the free day the credibility of the source in question. In a series of Tweets to the subject, the President wrote in other cases, the "sogened Whistleblower" has broken information from the second hand that had been made as an incompatible, so it may be no helper or spion.
As Trump in New York on those who had to play the Whistleblower's information, however, the advice was resolved. The President of the US representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted and declared that Trumps exhibition was more than one time the integrity of the Government.
In the representative house, the democracies have already been in various committees in various researchs against Trump and its environment. In view of Ukraine's procurements, the democracies are currently initiated with new growth to establish a possible attachment procedure against Trump in gang.
"The Whistleblower has given us a vehicle plan for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump took the ship, threw him a false demonstration of things, and requested the return of the Committee. Trump was regularly determined and had already required the ship for months ago.
More than 300 US government employees from the Security and Foreign Political Affairs, mostly under democratic, but also under the Republican Presidents, were published in one statement published in the free day after the possible investigation of the democracies for the possibility of exploitation procedures.
For the further process, there is no exact time plan. With its majority in the representative house, the demokrates could try a similar emphasis procedure. However, the decision on a real official detection fell in the Senat where the Trumps Republicaners have the majority. The views for the success of such procedures are less.
VW Office Council: Workplaces are "smoking"
The plans of the VW market, in the production, could continue to send the costs, to launch the fertilization in Germany and Europe. This concern causes the operating Council of the autobuilding. The market wants to take their annual factors from 10 billion euros to 2023 to two billion euros, so it must be shared for 500 million euros in this year.
A key for this is the personal cost. The 2016 between the company and the employee Council "country" has already seen the building of 14,000 workplaces alone in Germany. It is essentially applied: a workplace can only be built at the autobuilding, if it is often proved that the activities that are not required for this, and it applies to a employment security to 2029.
As our newspaper is now discovered from operating rates, however, workplaces in the production that actually does not get to disposal, "failable" by another way - so the official curses will not be replaced by free regular positions.
In these cases, the Office Council has no possibility to reduce the reimbursement. However, many persons are able to take the work assessment that the concerns of a general exclusion of vehicles would be greater, and that the fear of the vehicles could be reached from Germany and Europe because it is more worthy in other parts of the world.
The VW Mark wants to standardize the production in the world more and maintain new projects in the world. It also needs to be satisfied and decided to increase the productivity and to increase competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann said on a manager conference in Berlin: "We are increasingly increasing times from Brexit to the low trade war between the United States and China."
In this way, it is already successful: For example, in this year, the product costs from 2013 would be driving in comparison with the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time should be introduced for the golf 8, which should be introduced on 24 October in Wolfsburg to decrease 1,1 hours. Exact numbers for the production duration VW does not apply after our golf 7d information.
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory, which is produced in the vehicles. The works of Braunschwing and Salzgitters are completed. For Wolfsburg, the VW-internal rules are applied that there must be built for annually 800,000 cars, so that the work is satisfied. 2018 was launched in Wolfsburg, but only about 700,000 vehicles - consistently by the new consumption and gas-procedure WTPL.
As Tostmann has already announced in Wolfsburg "perspective" in the last year, it must round a million cars from the band. This should make the golf production in the steel tool - because the work Zwickau is dismissed by the construction of the E-automatic production location.
Furthermore, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sale payments of golf and Tiguan were recently developed. Therefore, the expectations are reposed on the golf 8. He must stay at the end of all efforts to build the e-mobility of the bulfsburger's bread and butter car.

The British President Johnson criticizes the "Capturation Health" agreed by the Parliament.
The Parliament is back, a law suggests to the British Premier to deny a chaos breight, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a cluster.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to continue a non-regulated brexit, but the last laws decided by the Parliament, which should just stop, and on a question, Johnson said only before journalists, his Government will be fulfilled by the rights.
The Law suggests that the Government should request the movement of the expenditure term, not to be agreed with the EU until the middle of October. Johnson criticizes this as the "capturation Health", which has made the negotiations with the EU.
The first British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspect on the Sunday, Johnson could try to use "political skicks" to achieve the law, and the Prime Minister could ensure a procedure that would move the entry into force of the law on time after the EU's expenditure. Johnson said, "We are convinced to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with a agreement."

"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stand before Linda McCartney's camera, who became one of the very big Rock photographs. But it is not always the big glamour. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taschen) rolled a deep in the world of the private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was invisiblely honourable and honourable when he presented the image band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the Middle September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. It was also Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders Fraude Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote in Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flying view in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a feed for the belief of LindaMcCartney as an engineering artist and the sofortmage of Polaroid films."
In Linda McCartney, the artist history at the University of Aizona, until she found a photography, the camera was always there. thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them are now published first in the "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portrets, silences, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interesters from the past 70s to the late 90s. "He wanted real moments," wrote Ekow's artistic crisis in his proposal. And, of course, he's always again in the middle point: your husband Paul - how you might never have seen him.
So he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoes, telephoned in the bathroom with a shoot on the head or throwing unfortunate moonboots. Certainly, McCartneys were a extraordinary family, but on the side of the shoelight light on her farm in South England or in Scotland, even a whole normal life. So Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that her father of ancient cartoffel shoes. And yet it was not always with McCartney.
How almost another media starts the polar camera directly. The records of Linda McCartney are sure a kind of family daybook, but they are very much more than clean snapshots.
It's about the decision-click: you have to recognize when a great picture happens before you. And then you have to cut it in exact moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you're kicked two seconds later or two seconds ago, it can be a completely another photo." And Linda had the gift to always be just the right moment. "I knew it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
That is the light, the composition, the image section and the colors that "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a sustainable image book for Beatles-Fans, but in addition to all the Anexdotics is also a great ethnic comfort, where landscapes have already worked as a abstracte birds. The perfect fulfillment to the new beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared in exact 50 years ago.

Thunberg was established in August 2018 before the Swedish Parliament in order to demand the politicals of their country to a stronger use for climate protection, and it has been in short time the Fridays for Future movement, and the climate protests are involved in all schools and students, but also scientists and other adults.

New World Climate Proteste of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, you want to renew thousands of people for more climate protection on the streets.
In the end of a international climastric week, Fridays for Future planned actions and customers in thousands of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests have been planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munch and Culture, but also in small communities and cities such as young people in North Riin Western and Westerland in Sylt. Climateivistin Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large city in Canadian Montreal.
Who really are Thunberg's innermans?
Justice and strength are high taxers, even in the 21th century, in a world full of wars and smoking factors that preserve the climate. It is more amazing that a 16-year-year girl calculates the powerful men of this time keeps the speed before the nase. However, what is there? Is it help or smart marketing a climate? Historical teaching or manipulative tactics for himself?
On the other hand, Greta Thunberg sets the massage in movement and brings young people to rise for a better climate friendly world. It is not historic to see the first time in Europe that a young man makes a meeting to children and young people for themselves. In the year 1212 a child named Nikolus was emphasized to put up for a righteous world, and then he also has a damn of young people to win for themselves and to overcome the sea to go over to the country, to make it easy to go to the ground, as Greta was made to go back to a seal with a seal boat.
However, there is a shadow page? Why is it needed a action named "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has reached PR-manager on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has been longly sold, thanks to the girl who is in the ramp light. Even the ageful followers of Greta Thunberg have been a little stress over the last PR-Show, or the traveling with the Boot was also a few followers. This is not also a fundamental basis for the action, since the media has come in the worldly well-wide, and much thanks to the works.
Now the spirits are different now: Is it moral to reach financially in the world? Is it yet authentic when some persons are working together with the world's safeguard action? It is likely to be a critical and reflected view point is always important in a democratic society because the democracy lives from various opinions and discussions. So, through Sin, it is likely to ask criticisms of certain trends.
Comet detected: Interstellary Gast crossed by our sun system
A stranger comet is crossed at the moment of our sun system.
The suspects of the astronomes have confirmed: a strange comte is crossed at the moment of our sun system - he is only the second of his type.
Garching/Washington - long the researchers have just condemned it, but now they have consciousness: A comet of another star crossed in the moment of our sun system. He was baptized after his detector 2I/Borisov, and just busyed astronomes.
2I/Borisov: Comet was detected by Amateurastronoms on the Crime
The obvious body was discovered by a Amateurastronom named Gennadi Borissow on the crisis. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and more observations confirmed his first thought. It is actually a unknown comit√© that is not from our sunsystem. He is only the second kind of his type, which was looked at the travel.
The great opportunity for astronomes is now to get out of the nearly face in a foreign sun system. Obviously, the Commission likes to our own systems, as the astrophysical Institute of Channels. The comit√© is clearly interstellary origin according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moved on a similar hyperbel tree that leads him out of our system.
Comet has already been viewed - and can be observed several months
However, before it is so far, the astronomes can immediately watch him. For in accordance with his property, 2I/Borisov has already been considered in his air, which means that he can be investigated for many months from the earth. "This object will be the greatest light of December and will still be seen until April 2020 with a large telescope," explains David Farnocchia from the US Room Office of Nassa. "There will only be achieved until October 2020.
The progressor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First recognition on Comet 2I/Borisov is expected in science
According to the first recognition, the comet is appreciated at 2 to 16 kilometers of durchmesser. In the same time, the sky skins seem to be similar to our comit√©s - because as the IAC researcher Julia de Le√≥n is expressed, the spectrum of the swimming star is similar to us. This observation is close to that the comit√©s in other sun systems may form similar processes as in our, the Leone College Javier Licandro.
However, the observation comes out of individual knowledge, which have already discovered two such objects within only two years, allows a new way to investigate certain processes in other sunsystems.
Always again busy asteroids the researchers. Firstly, a rise asteroid was fulfilled on the earth and came to her dangerously closed.

He declared that an atmosphere was being a arise in the event of the attack.
First a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had submitted his office as State Secretary and Mandat as Tory-Agents. "I was cut down in the past months between loyalty to family and national interest - it's an insolventable Spanish," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language also grew up in the church at serious critics. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and arts of the Church of England criticize the language that "the countrys are not worthy." In a common statement they explained, "In the past days, the language is, even in the debates and outside the Parliament, not acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other."

A Viewer and Youtuber makes Egypt's rulers: First, Mohamed Ali remains, but better in the foreign.
The two men who have influenced whether blood flows back on the streets of Egypt have both cut off the past weeks in the outland. One of the two weakened on the airport of Kairo. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the United Nations General Assembly. The Ex-General, the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, who was the first chosen State officer of the country, was denied, had been able to cut down a time in New York: the US President Donald Trumps had been raised against the political and none of the human rights in a few weeks - the first of the egiphome, the first chosen officer of the country.
In the Irish, it is trying to see the President of the other man who is now known the tract on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained self-bearing in the foreign country, where he is attached to the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egyptian lands. The 45-year-old-year-old player was only a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the token voice that the political diskures in the Caf√©, the residence and the Teube of the land: Youth with his YouTube "Kamalheimsheims" exploited his country to be raised against himself.
He's going to make the State team directly and through a rhythical language. While the people's hunger, the President in Luxembourg smile and let himself build a pretty new pattern, it says. The army execution to support his government will take Ali Corruption and exploitation. Since he made in his secondary employee for 15 years with exactly these employees, he seems to know exactly what he speaks - at least the pressure of many epidemics to explore rightly.
The first week since Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands of people against his government, and at least 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights and opposition policy, were arrested, and Ali called for this freedom to a "millions march" to a "million march", which really would be so many people on the streets, it was unlikely. But it came to one of the smallest protests, for example in Giseh in Kairo, and in China. Videos in society medical medicines showed the proceedings of the participants of the Al-March Corruption and its disagreements. This procedure also made the policy's ranges and the videos have not been able to cut off.
From the city Mansura in Nildelta, where the Demonstrancies have risen with the portrait of the President in pieces, it has been reported on the freetage of massive policy. Security forces have made Checkpoints in the city and in the outside streets. In Kairo, several U-Bahn stations were closed in the inner states, because of "Instauring works" that most streets around the town, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Raba-Platz, on the 2013, the holder of the Muslim Brothers, was able to explore the arms, and to 800 people should be able to be able to reach a greater income.
Mohamed Ali rejected these proceedings to a change of his taktic: "Our goal must not be the target place," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Now let's go together with police offices." But it's not to understand, "The whole Egypt is the Tahrirplatz."
