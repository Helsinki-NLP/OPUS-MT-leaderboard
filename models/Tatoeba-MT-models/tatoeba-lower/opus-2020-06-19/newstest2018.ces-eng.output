Report for the citizen rights has made a road expression for Missouri
The National Association for Assessment of Colours (NAACP) has published warnings for colouring people who go to Missouri on the basis of discrimination principles of State and rasistic attacks.
“The USACP Recommendation for Missouri, with efficiency from 28 August 2017, calls African travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri, to make a higher attention in the case of a series of sport racial incidents in which the current period is present in the State’s country,” shall be stated in the report.
The NAACP stated that this step was attached to the basis of the present laws of Missouri State, which reduce the restrictions of racismly motivated acts before the Court, as well as the consequence of the treatment of the authorities under criminal management, which are inappropriately objectives to smaller.
“It's going to devote citizens' rights.
People are stopped by the police only because of their colours, they are attacked or killed, "for Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still have the greatest number of weakness."
It is one of the first warnings of his type that the organization has delivered for the United States.
The incidents that the organization citated were rare motivated to students in the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black footman from Tennessee.
Sanders died for a sport circumstances at the beginning of the airplane year after he got a benzine in the country, and the police put it into a construction without accusation of crime.
The rural recommendation also advises the recent declaration of the Highest State Procedure of Missouri State, which indicates that the Black Leaders have 75 % higher opportunity to stop the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and cooperators before what could be done in Missouri,” said the Chapel.
“The people have to be ready - should be carried out money on the case of the case or to notify their relatives that they are able to travel in the country.”
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme for the reporting of negative actions in Missouri, in 2015, to hundred accidents of unnecessary behaviour, which will be achieved at the sixteenth place between all States.
It is also responsible for the new Missouri law, which facilitates the application of the company for discrimination in the offering of employment or employment.
The American vote for citizen freedom (ACLU) has provided a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved the immigration law that allows States to keep people on the basis of the discharge of this law that has to improve racial profile by ACLU.
The rural recommendation usually provides the Ministry of Agriculture for Foreign countries, but in the last time the advocats groups have adopted these measures in response to specific laws and trends in the United States.
The model was killed by the chief.
She's a family even after 12 years, she's not quiet!
The murder is a model of Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl's origin from Croydon was killed by the shepherd Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked in 2005.
The victim and the murder had to have sex together and buy the marihuan, the officer killed her.
Then the murder was sitting in a deep chair and looked at the hard criminal work of searching the field of action.
Dixie, an old shepherd, was judged in 2008 to take freedom for 34 years for murder and disappointment of Sally's model.
He in the court accepted only the attack of a young man and the lawyer said that his client has already found a dead girl to lay on the street.
After three years, the police tested him.
Dixie said that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sprotson were talking about the night.
The murder said, "He was seriously threatened, and the girl began crying after his attack."
"Every even said the attention and the taxi," he said lying.
The girl had to fight his explanation, but she could, even though, was amazing.
Lewis had to get her on the street.
Dixie's version was pronounced as lying and accused him.
After the reconnaissance, Dixie spoke about his sustenance and poverty after the girl.
When she touched her after sex, she felt happy and had to burn a marihuan.
Before Sally's incident was with his old friend, drinking alcohol and takeing cocaine, he said to Dexie himself.
He said he felt adrenal.
Sally started crying about help, so she fell back and put her hand through the mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family takes other attacks from the vandals who destroy her tomb.
For the last half of the year, they smoked him four times.
In freedom, they are so cruel people who burn these graves.
"So our daughter isn't there anymore," consulted the Mirror mother of Linda's famous girl's information about the mixture of the smoke with the smoke.
Linda was waiting for the aircraft, but they always had to shoot when she went out of the grave.
Drawing vibrators are still ten thousand.
"The challenges are not courageous or concertful," says Martin Raja, who leads a bucket intimity.
You'll find design and luxury erotical help in it.
Including those from the Czech Designers of Anny Maresh.
It started unexpectedly, a huge twelve years ago.
Martin Raja and his friends shot on the cycle fly after Mora.
One of them took not only a round, but also the cuts full of the spectacular vibrators.
"The variety of cords and delfines and all it was green and yellow and just entirely different," she tells me about food.
His friend decided to cooperate with the German producer of design erotical assistance Fun Factory, which Martin's employment, and so he offered him to help the marketing.
When the company went to get other professionals, he replaced him.
Today, the Benedit Street Intimity is carried out in the street Benedit, where he sells erotical assistance as usually offered by luxury cabels or bottles.
Why not?
It is also part of design purposes.
Wait a minute, you're talking about this dinner, do you say?
But come on, don't be like puritians!
Just a Berlin trade Fun Factory, who proposed a recognized designer Karim Rashid, served for the Intimity bucket as inspiration.
They opened him in 2010, and it was completely another concept of the erotic trade than on which all here are normal.
No covered expenditures, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products designed like in parfumery.
Martin and his business partner Heaven Shebella began to consider how to take a fresh trade where he should be and how he should be named.
The name of Intimity enjoyed both.
"It's an intimity that's the last, and it's, it's, it's going to say, it's not," says.
It followed the buying of Internet domains and searching for a suitable space that went parallelly with various inter-visualizations.
Finally, the variety was gained by the trade in the garden and the room that leads to bed.
She prepared Dagmar Stephan from the FormaFatal study.
We found space in 2013.
First, he didn't look perfectly perfect because he's not on the main street, but he's sitting back on the name of Intimity.
It's intimate.
He's in the street near that main, so nobody's seeing the officers," he blessed Martin Radge.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to build a business that would be another, with a pretty beautiful goods, in the middle where women who are overwhelmed of our recorders feel well.
And not to be surprised that they entered into such business.
When I came to the Intimity bucket half an hour ago, the street was empty.
In addition, I didn't even feel that I was going to trade with erotic helpers.
Just at the door, she surprised me a clean interieur elegance that I know from the boxes with a modem.
Although it's only a woman's service in the area, it's not that women don't be afraid to ask help, it doesn't mean that the man's feet wouldn't be smoking here.
The majority of the ladies are going to buy gifts for their friend.
"The most people don't have to cut up the right size and vote almost greater," martyr suffers of a fresh error.
That's the cases, the cups that women need a big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith will choose a very big vibrator.
Likewise, the men call overwhelming black hair, where the woman is driving up to the red color.
Absolute bestseller is in the present product strictly called Satisfyer.
From my face, it must be clear that I don't know who's fighting, because Martin explains immediately how it works.
It's such an undotic stimulator of clitoris.
Pere needs to think about what a serious tone has given me.
It's like it wasn't.
And it doesn't really beat.
It's for a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe it would be so well accepted.
It's about the last revolutionary news.
The first revolutioner made a vibrator in the face of the sea horse.
He said that women started more interesting about the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for the We-Vibe Party.
He completely destroyed the table that some men can survive, and that in the erotical helps they see competition.
"They do different variables," continues.
With one engine, with two motors, with a remote control.
That's a favorite category.
A woman may have the controller in the hands of a lovely connection and determine the intensity of vibration.
In addition, a certain disaster is the category of attached vibrators.
So at least with us.
The Czech women, seems to be aware of multiple education and buy classic vibrators, although they only need to use it externally.
However, in West Europe, in particular in younger statements, is very popular.
What are men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
Maybe it should be taken a little different.
The question is what to offer men," says Martin.
"And we have helpful for them, but in a limited way." The most important masturbator is sold, in this case from Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't seem like anatomy like vagina, but "that's like smoking ice, or as a smoke or a future object.
It is much focused on the functionality and the use of use.
So, in Japan, it's totally different.
He calls it in me.
I had the Japanese's suffering very much for herotic help, I'm taking it.
"This is the Internet reality," I'm explained.
The inside is entirely different.
Here in Europe are erotical assistance almost linked to women.
In Japan, they are just normal for men, and they are a table for women." Only for interest, the Japanese Tag Tenga, which is in the Intimity bucket, is sold globally, creates the half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Chess and the Chess are not wise.
Even so, we're a whole nation of exciting.
Determinedly in the difference from the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is moved between 35 and 50 years and "with a certain experience with sexual life, but with some helps.
It's going to come for something nice, quality, which would be fulfilled by partner life or for himself." To return, Martin Ray and his business partners, Heaven Shebella are trying to convince whether it is perfectly functional.
We don't want to leave to specialise the type of boundaries and latex because we have no space, but it's not going to happen.
Such things might be able to reject those we're trying to go to go.
They're people who always had to go to sex, because they're afraid they're gonna get something like that.
Many products based on the bowls are really favorable.
It is also given by the election of the renamed tags.
Some of them even got design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first assessment was mentioned by the sea horn, and it has been changed in the whole floor.
It started to lose the left materials and then work with healthy independently, it began to produce other designs, different colors...
It's a pleasant that some are designed by the Czech, and the popular designer of Anna Maresh.
I have to say I've been surprised, how many people are with us, whoop.de.doo's buying from Anny Maresh, even though they're relatively better.
They're the lawyers who walk right for Venusine's balls from Anny Maresh.
She really took a serious job because in the Czech Republic and in the foreigners she repeated exactly what we are trying to present us - that herotic helps make others, beautiful, with history.
Annin's story started as a school work.
Now it's about the preparatory product that is more produced with us.
I wanted to have the production process under control, and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo produces products.
Because it's not about the big road, but the small series, it's probably more important than the bigger series.
Maybe I'm going a little contrary, but I think it's important to maintain the development in the Republic of the Czech Republic.
It may be quiet that we will not know anything for a few years, "Anna, who agrees to Martin, is what we're going to do.
It is not a negative or rejected position.
It's a lot of people to disappear.
"But you're starting to smile." Currently Anna Maresh has a vibrator offer, on which you can make a personal message, and the years also plans its own orrical egg.
In the next year, she should have come to a vibrative ticket and another news.
Health limits
I'm interesting where the limits of what's okay.
Is there something that Martin Raza wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to definite.
What's going to be normal, otherwise it can be considered innormal, so we're almost limited a sort of tag producers.
No one of them will be left in some extremities.
Before we get out, I have the last question: What was the most stupid question they got?
It's just now on the week, e-mail, where some Mrs. asked a masturbation help for his friend with the nature of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like this.
It's still a question if someone hasn't done fun of us, "Martin is a firm view.
And it's going to happen from time...
Morning for Karla Goda.
After two Alzheimer's kids!
His friend Karel Stodry fights with a serious disease.
The best friend Karla Goda fights with a disease that robs people all reminders.
"Yes, it's crazy to the truth," confirmed the painful information of the Blesk himself.
I know about my disease, and I'm still in view of it to the entire circumstances.

"I'm still looking for a song word that I don't forget it," advised Karel.
The same disease is now fighting in the stage and the heritage of Blood Fial.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer in your family?
Look at how to keep him.
The Chile Parliament interrupted the mandate of interruption, the United Nations Court of Justice.
In Chile, there is still a absolute mandate of an artificial interruption, so it is not to be done by health reasons.
"I'm sorry that the lawyers have set the courage to the Court of Justice and that now ten people will decide on what we agreed in the Parliament more than two years," she consulted the socialist senator Isabel Allende.
The official court in Chile has ten members and the end of the August should have a new Chair in accordance with the AFP near obsession.
The Law of Desolation of Absolute Interruption, initiated by the present President Michelle Bachelet, approved Senat 19 July.
The regulatory obsession later announced that the law would fall in the court because, according to it, the right of unborn child for life.
The messengers of voting on the proposal of the law in the past month have deposited it until the complaint of the Commission.
In the middle of the messengers agreed the proposal, and he made the Senat again.
According to the new legislative amendments, a criminal interruption should be suspended in three cases: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fruit does not have hope for survival or if the adultery has resulted from disagreement.
Such exclusions were already existed in the Spanish letter of El País in Chile since 1931, so before women have received a choice law in 1949.
Absolute interruption in 1989, Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries of the world where the absolute interruption is paid.
Others are Nikaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador now are about 20 women who are excused to interrupt the thirty-year-year prison challenges.
Thus, in many cases, according to the human rights protection of the spontaneous condemnation, the judge marked as a murder.
Is there something more holy?
The last Trump's white house is now Socha Svobody
The unexpected changes of the mode is the criteria of the shoes.
The Americans could tell it as well as all of the others - see increasingly unpredicted Shoes Saddam Husyan in the Bagdad Department of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key residents of Trump's mode, was sure known to what it was hidden when when the CNN reporter Jim Acosto was on the proposals for the drastical restrictions of legitimate accommodations expressed a symbolic sequence on Swobody.
It's supposed to add that Miller didn't hit the shoes like that.
For this, he would lie to him by the leaders of the east ships and the imitators of Sochy Svobody.
However, he insisted on her meaning, particularly in the fact that in 1903, the plaquet was located on the basis of the honourable Emmy Lazarus, and that was 17 years after the end of the monument.
Miller said: “I don’t want to leave here to history, but Socha Freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that leads light to the whole world.
The base that was placed additionally on the basis, and on which you refer to is not its part."
Miller's actually right, but as he did, it's not about his story.
It is especially about Emmy Lazarus, who resigns this time - call them not only the migrants, but you who are the most amazing ones: "Let me go, who is the poor, who is free to rejoice freely, who is with a red red in the middle of the cities."
And just in modern times, we can be better than ever looking for these "which red" on our screens.
Miller didn't try the poesia criticism -- he wanted to explain that these people are not in the United States.
This conflict on the significance of sochy is part of the contexts of political and cultural war: it is a conflict based on the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who encouraged her death to set plaquets with a plot based on the socks, knew very well that it was in a high political game.
Socha had to express the connection of the French and American Republic Government in representation of the classic subject, so women's freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her base, there is no abstract woman, but he has his own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the ransoms.
It is a brilliant feministic threat and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way Emma Lazarus changed the significance of the socks, the declarer of the right is trying to reverse this significance.
Conscious commentary Rush Limbaugh - John Christian in the cases of Trump's action to power - in 2010, he argumented that the Socha Svobody really doesn't call anyone to the country, but represents a reasonable non-constructiveisme, bringing the American floor to the rest of the world: “Sweet Svobody smokes forward.
He exceeds freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
There is no reason to light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's buying brings to a matter of important thing.
The significance of the shoes is important for the view.
Emma Lazarus describes the smoke from the view of the crashed and lost traveling, which often after long and horrible ships, such as the ocean, comes with hope in the heart into a new country.
One is a perfect view of the world in the eyes of people who look for a refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this view she expresses hope and hears their needs.
And, of course, it's a perspective that Miller or Trump do not know.
They have no reason to clarify the way, but to resolve hate which is their only source of power.
The world mystery in the athletic 2017: Neil Black will praise the Scotland members of the British team
Eiley Doyle reminds the time when the British team had only two Scotland members
The Atlantic Federal Director of the United Kingdom Neil Black showed that the powerful 16 Scotlands in the world's Mistery Team will be “the great offer for the team.”
For MS in London 2017, starting at Friday, was chosen a record number of Scotland Atlets.
Black believes that in Scotland, "It's something special" and the British atletic could be learned from Scotland.
“ We're trying to understand and adjust -- we'll work on this," said Black.
“ I talked to people of the Scope Sport Institute, and they think that it is something to do with what they did.
Scope atletics think that it's something to do with what they did.
British atletics: he has something to do with what they did.
It also thinks people on the streets.
Whatever it is, it's very wonderful."
Some Scotland Atlets will be courageous of medailles, including Laury Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will support Siram Mo Farahem at 5000 meters, while Eilida Doyle was chosen for the team's captain.
“ Elijah is humble.
She's driving word was amazing," said Black.
“ Many atleta, Scotlands or other nationalities, have already gone out of the room with a great threat and motivation.
The unconscious and unconscious feelings with what Eilida spoke were incompatible."
The silver medyalist Commonwealth, which will contribute to over 400 meters to its fifth mystery of the world, has shown that it is “incredible” that in the British team is 16 Scotland Atlets.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The Muir's currency on the Middle Trade was determined only for the last year five British and two European records.
MS will participate on 1500 m and 5000 m.
Next of the great Scotlands is Chris O'Hare, who moves to 1500 m in the airline, he won the British teams and the Early Game.
Doyle reminds her first mystery, on which was the only other school member of Lee McConnell team.
The team's captain said that it's a very courageous "the fact that it was not only a large number of her colleagues, but in many cases, they will also be avoided to participate in financial and medailles.
“It was a great honor for me, but they know that the members of the team have chosen me are pleasant, ” added.
“ Obviously, I am very hungry about all the Scots that came to the team.
It proves where I went up.
They're athletes who's going to think about the front of the bed.
What about my officer?
Yeah, I think she's taking it.
I only warned the fact that we can be on a aircraft mystery, because it's on the ground of the house.
It is important to use the support of home fans and to enjoy the fact that we're back to the olympian station.
I've got a second chance to get out and I'm gonna use an accidental atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't take care of the public function if you don't have the criticism of the volators
Our father knew the criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the news were not long to criticize him for anything, starting Turkish political and ending his political views.
Yeah, this crisis didn't leave her hungry.
But he didn't try to dress the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of show can be disappointed, and the stupid, and we will be led as a sheep for a thief. ”
This brings me to Maryland is a governor of Larry Hogan, who needs to work on to start holding as Washington.
Hogan's employees locked and removed the articles at least 450 people who had freely shown their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Union requested her for a civil liberty.
The officers of the guarantee rejected as an unfair and in the comments on the Internet have appeared a lot of views of the type "who it's interesting."
"It's just Facebook," has introduced many users.
But it's important.
Especially in the moment that it's about people like Hogan.
In absolute Democratic State, it is an independent popular government.
It can boast the second highest favorite of all 50 governments.
Hogan isn't surprising.
As it is vital, his state rules with confidence and maintains principles.
It appeared that it was also rejected in the use of Facebook as a main environment to connect to its choices - exceptionally, there is no publication of the first photo with the head of chemotherapy after chemotherapy completion.
The blocking of people who are on the guarantee page - which is a public forum, marked as official and administrative employees of the money of payers - is too dangerous and in the end of the result.
In the conversation for the Washington Post Hogana speaker, Amelia Chasse's gubernant was able to lock the comments from the moderation of the articles.
However, use images of internet thrones, spamers or different people are too easy.
Washington Post told some real people who were deleted by the articles.
And exactly these are the effective people who speak to their chosen leaders; teacher, business, and shepherd, no thrones.
As they all brought, their comments were fair and supervisible, not robbery.
The Pastor in his commentary cited the Bible, approving the Catholic faith of Hogan.
The lawyer of the company Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., was concerned about an abominable crime, but her commentary was not happy.
“I had noticed that I had made his insufficient reactions on unnecessary crimes and other current reports, ” wrote in the section of the commentary of Washington Post.
“I don't like the thought that when a certain number of people comments the same subject, some people are designed to propagate such collective efforts instead of recognised as a major group of interested citizens."
What the gubernamental employees called "the central spam stage" would likely be called "behaviour".
The moderable Facebook error allows us easily to handle articles by locking critics or eliminating negative comments.
It is much more agreed than in the past when the same procedure requires to send employees to the street where they should collect and burn all expressions with critical or stop protests.
And that's exactly what happens, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public operator, which will be criticized for Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is a defense from Twitter users, which has been refused to access his account.
One of the first important Regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The President of Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, after the periodical judge James C. Cacherise first added in Alexandria, where one of the choices has been able to access one of her Facebook pages.
Gubernant Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also attended a visit from ACLU because of the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
During Washington, the low price of the e-mail was practically the same impact as the Internet.
In the middle of 1776 and 1800, the number of day pressure was multiplied, and his position was understood of many anonymous writers.
And even in those times, Washington had to build with anonymous thrones.
People, who were written under "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the news and rejected Washington's decision.
According to historical documents, people gathered people in the online project Paps of George Washington Project in his officers were assembled a request criticising his opinion in the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with British.
But he didn't lose him.
The freedom of demonstration, non-consciousness and fear is in our own nation's basic basis.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Chess used a free roaming quickly, in the borders need more data than home.
In the Chess borders, they need more of their tariff than home.
The most part of them are moved in Rakous, but the consumption of data in the air zone is carried out in Croatia.
However, they have more time to browse on the web, but most of them do not have the possibility to connect to the Wi-Fi.
Buying, buying, and smart phone in the hand.
So it seems to be a typical chess released in Croatia after the customers can use the service of tam operators for home price.
It is exceeded from the O2 statistics.
Thanks to new roaming rules, most of the Chess travellers in the field are available for more data in the framework of the breakfast than home.
It is therefore not amazing that in Croatia, where the minimum shipping of our steams are stealed in the airline of aeroplane, even 50-year-old data needs.
On the second place in the board of the data needed, then Italia was located.
The most minutes of the Chess call from Germany, where many of them are working and in years.
Croatia, according to the data of the Association of Chess Travel Officers, visits 800 thousand Czech, is our most popular destination.
However, people have changed a book for participation of interests through the mobile phone.
The record was 7 July.
"To the transferd data, 10 million photographs will come," she described the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia is carried out in the data, the highest number of Chinese users is moved in neighbor countries.
In the first place, it's Rakous, follows German and Slovenia.
Croatia is the fourth and the sixth Italy.
In Rakous, we're going for more tourism and active allowance that we have no longer time to browse on the Internet.
"From Rakouska, in addition, Czech is right to Jadrana," she explained Cieslar.
While at the date, the operator signed the operation after the release of high-year cross-border growth, the telephone is a lower growth.
The number of minutes in the roaming has grown up to the low year on a double-second.
With a severe smoking before other countries here, Germany.
"Roaming rules use most of the professional clients on work paths," added Ceeslar.

Hurry and death in Indian country gold
When Bardina Degei's party, he doesn't use the sport.
In fact, she's just using the master.
In her tree chatch, which is in the main city of Panniai Enarotali in the Indian provincies of Papua, a woman usually simply bears a sweet brambour - in the words of local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half hours, we'll take the brambor and take it with poor hands.
The bardin sits on the white land - the house is not built by the town - where it also works every day, for example, the branch smoke in the water broken from a remote mobile.
The cups in the room without the shoes supply the toalet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband was not assigned to her fields to train.
Polygamia is normal here.
The work in the late night is dangerous: most men in the field are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
“On week after five hours, no one will allow you to go around the ice," says Bardina.
It is a serious view of each day life on the highway of Papua, the old Netherlands Colonia, which was issued as part of Indonesia in 1969 after the control reference, when only 1026 elders were given to vote a form of public expression against the army.
The currently protesting against the Netherlands rules has rapidly turned into his wrath against the Kaart Government, which has controlled the whole region with except foreign newspapers or civil rights.
In 2003, the provincies were officially divided in Papua and West Papua - independently Papua-New Guinea had an east part of the island.
Enarotali is so far away and left town where you get up after ninety-minute air from the main town of Jayapura to Nabire, and then the fifty-hour prisoner's officer.
This isn't a great movement on this place.
The city with 19,000 citizens sit with tree houses covered by bambus flowers, skins of rolled balls in the shadows and smooth colors.
This place was only very little indonesians, even newspapers, and practically no strangers.
Before the coming of the Christians, the local citizens worshiped the god of Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“ We weren't usually used to cut these clothes, ” says Bardina, showing our colored, handwritten tropion, dark trick and shadow smoke.
"Now we just took a list before."
Papua is the most important provincies of Indonesia - 28% of the citizens live under the border of poverty and more children's death and gravity is one of the worst in Asia.
However, it is the Indian country of gold.
The largest and highest golden deal in the world of Grasberg, which is the own company of Freeport McMoran from the American Phoeenix, is only 60 miles from Pania - a scanned provincie near New Jersey, which is about 153 000 citizens.
Only in 2015, Freeport has enjoyed the gold and the middle of $3,1 billion.
Furthermore, Papua supports the threat of the tree in the value of 78 billion dollars.
These riches are, however, for the Papua's resource of suffering and destruction from the part of the powerful Indonesian Army.
From the investigation in 2005, New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military actors and agencies for about 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including $15,000 for one officer.
Papuans who call after samose are rightly threatening this gold hush, and therefore they are severely condemned.
Following human rights activists, more than 500 000 Papuans were killed since 1969, and thousands of others were deceived, condemned and arrested by the Indonesian Army.
Mass murders in the rock area of Papua in the past 70th century were equal to genocide as the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Only in the past year, the Indonesian police was arrested in the region more than 3900 peaceful protestants.
In Will Lose Everything, the report of the British Arcidience from 2016, describes the cross of the past year, as a mixed training, murder - according to the following reports, it is particularly popular deficiency and transport of electricity - and brutal exposure of peace demonstrators.
“ It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents every week exists, ” said Andreas Harson, an Indonesian Research Officer of Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has contributed to the fact that the Papua resources are applied to Indonesia Colonists.
From 3,5 million citizens are 83% reported to the Christianity, but democracy is changed by muslim immigrants from Indian islands - Javy, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawes.
The Japanese officers sold broken kitchens and gado-gage or the smile of green with a dream.
Local people fight for survival.
“Imigrants started sold rooms and green in traditional markets for lower prices than local Papua, ” explains the Fourty-fifty-year-year Abeth You, who was born in Pania and moved to work in the main city of Jayapura.
"The original towns of Papuy - Mommy (Women) - so they lost their job."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, whose advice was considered to Joko, in the framework of his President campaign in 2014, promised to resolve illegality and violation of laws.
The Teacher safeguarded and his path to the president pale in 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But in Papua it has changed very little, and local people feel disappointed.
“ Our heart was deceived because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope that he hears our call for justice, ” said you.
Reality is that only two months after the invasion of Jake's invasion was a great shot.
On 7 December 2014, the 11-year-old Children singed in the campaign fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers were cut out of the night.
Two of the surprised kids told them that they had to enable the light.
One of the soldiers came to this challenge and tone that was spoken, and later returned with four other soldiers, introduced the local Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the officers followed a group of children and killed them with their weapons, brought victims and witness events.
One of the soldiers then burned the child's group.
One of the kids, Julianus Yeimo, was killed so strong that he fell into the camera.
A few hours later, someone has submitted an independent election committee, and the next day things were still exhausted.
Almost 1000 young people and women were gathered together at the football crime before local police stations and military government and were required by justice.
They came with the white-ups and finished the tank of wait - in which he walks in the rock and follows the songs of birds - the paponic kmene of Mee Pago.
Some protestants started home on the building stone.
With the return of the soldiers, the command was given by the radio: “When it has been tried at least three times to resist, you have the permission to shoot,” indicated the TIME week in the official document which the contents were never published in local media.
Jeremiah Kame (56), boss of the fourth Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized a terrible danger and called the citizens to go into their homes.
But no one had his words.
“ When I turned around, someone shoot me in the left shooting, ” said the TIME weekend on the ground of his small tree house.
Kamame still doesn't know who was a shooter, but, according to his word, one of the present soldiers was a ring.
“Therefore there were many people, and they were very shooting,” added.
One of the local citizens, Alfius Youw, was according to the word of his sister, who was a witness of a shooter, was treated immediately.
“ I was going to the body to convince that it was really he, ” said the TIME weekly excited voice of Yohanes, which uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead, I loved him."
The Papua Police Inspector, General Yotje Mende, reported to the newspapers that his officers only “secured” stations that were under the attack.
“We have to be afraid when people are dead to death, ” said in 2015, the pressing pharmaceutical police, Commander Pudjo Sulistiyo.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five protesters were killed, and many were excused with pain.
The report of the murder was informed by the quality media on the next day.
Three weeks later, he brought Joko to Jayapur's wealth and expressed his understanding for the family of the victims and promised that he would live in the violence in Papua.
“I'm requesting an immediate solution to this problem to never be repeated,” said he.
Minister of National Security Viranto, in October 2016, announced that it brings the mixed mechanism to resolve violent acts in the past.
At least immediately, but they started calling the statements.
“ The majority of violent acts has been long ago.
Some of them occurred in the past century and some at the beginning of the 21th century.
I want to say that we're going to decide these violent acts, but it's not a simple task," he said.
In the discussion of 5 June for the TIME weekend held in Yakarta, Viranto stated that it was not planning to make any measures in Papua.
Instead, he says that “all cases will be taken to the court.”
Virant of the United Nations committed “criminal crimes against humanity” based on more than one thousand dead involving elections from 1999 in Eastern Timor, that there was still 11 cases of disappearance of human rights in Europe, including incident in Poland.
The family of the victims of the victims in Panai was struggled with unbelieving.
“ In the past three years I was asked for four times, but then I didn’t expect anything, ” said Yohanes.
"I'm swallowed."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," as he says.
"I'm afraid the army's gonna stop me, or someone's gonna shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai citizens who have fear of the accident.
According to his words, the men of the army killed him after he helped to bury four of the victims.
“ After the grave of the body, I started looking for the army, ” he said.
And the shooting isn't still.
In the furniture, the Indonesian police shoot in the busy Deyai.
The officer who died one and the other 17 was destroyed, came between the officers and the manager of the establishment company, which refused to provide a help to transform a man in the hospital.
Ravianus Dou (24), who was struck at fishing in the dead river, died on the way to the hospital.
The universe's exploitation protested before the building company.
According to the explanation of the police officers, the officers were homes after the steals and the answers were a terrible shooting.
However, the local citizens say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) began to shoot in the damage and killed one man.
“ It was a panic, we had fear of the payment, ” he led for the TIME 29th Doming Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness of the complaint.
"I didn't go out of the house two days."
The Deyai Parliament requested the sustainance of participated polices and carrying mobile brigades from the area.
Maniai was always an indonesian government in the eye.
The absence of intellectual development is only deployed by the separation of household people of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the centeral highways.
Many of them have been associated with the Hawk for the Liberation of Papuai (OPM), the army of the Refugees, who protect the rights of the Papua's rights, in order to fight and attach indonesian polices.
Some of the OPM leaders are coming from Pania. They are compared to Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
Since the army's attacks in the last years had been arrested and volunteerly arrested thousands of people of Panai, it was all under the sign of “the security of the national loyalty”.
Some of them don't care anymore.
Paniai is known among the citizens of Papuai as “train and forgotten place”.
The oil is coming in the fire.
It's a little river that's sold in Enarotali, it's too hot for the local.
And the bread is the same inutile.
The citizens grow their food: mainly sweet brambles, fruits and list of green.
Women work on the fields; each of them makes four or five fields with famous brambors.
Most of them are increasingly defined for the needs of family, and the rests are sold on the local market.
Ten cups of sweet brambor are only 10 000 indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire airport opened more airports and started produced new immigrants, there is a growth of economic inequality between the family Papua and the adventure.
So many workplaces are usually occupied by more educated and riche immigrants.
Populars have the needs of capital and education to leave the business.
“Young people go out of the field because they are not enough of work opportunities and money,” said John Gobai, the President of the Body Council of Panai.
Thanks to the isolation is the Province of Papua hidden before the world.
They also apply the useful rules for foreign newspapers.
At the beginning of the aeroplane, two French newspapers - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - caused “the unrequired cooperation with the offices,” all of the fact that they have received such a valid authorisation to film.
Phelim Kine, director of the Asyrian Popular Organization of Human Rights Watch, Joko in his election campaign, promised to disappear the relevant rules for newspapers and to achieve transparency and development.
“To protective newspapers who work in the east-east regions of Papy and West Papy, are a great risk: the unrecognition of water and increasing on the black list,” he reported in the statement.
The income of reports from foreign newspapers means that the international indonesia in the matters of Papua is limited to significant measure.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon's Islands were urged - Council for Human Rights of the United Nations on the investigation of the “ diverse and extensive violence acts” in Europe, including a fight in Pacific.
These countries also supported OPM in the past.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry, Arrmantha Nasir, held an accusation when he published newspapers in Jacarta, saying: “Indonesia is still paying the democratic system and media free, so it is difficult to make evidence of human rights.”
The local people call after party of the foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in the chair of a sentence for the human rights Keesm Van Baarm, visited May 4, Jayapurau, the local people called in accordance with the resources that also participated in the meeting but wanted to remain in anonymously, “we want freedom” password.
In 2019, there are more choices in Indonesia, but the patrons say that they will not call Jokowi.
“ To a man who has a good mind, but it is turned to people with a shooting in Panai,” said Gobau, the President of the Room Council.
He wants to know that the people of Panai - except that they live in a terrible fear of the robbery army - are fighting in poverty, painful education and health systems.
Gobai says that the people of the Panai, as well as the other Papua, consider their voice for the “delegation” that must be used to Joko.
“They don't want money, they require righteousness,” adds.
In the midst of threat and fear of the families of the victims of the victims continue in the last symbolic attitude of the air: they burn the body of victims on the ground against the police and military station.
I know that righteousness will never be done enough, but at least it will not allow the responsible persons to forget their crimes.
“ He was killing our family members, ” said Yacobus with the heads of the head.
"What can we do?"
The French marine has obtained a large dose of cocaïne in Australia.
The French marine was holding 1,46 tonnes of cocaine in Tichomar, $256 million.
She's headed to Australia.
On the basis, the four-minute ship ships were arrested, which often creates people from Lithuania and Lots.
Jachta, named as Afalina, was exposed from South America, and the police left her after arresting in the city of Nouméa, the metropolis of the French Sea Territory of New Caledonia in the Tichem Ocean.
The Australian Report Service said that in collaboration with his international partners, he would encourage her to determine exactly where and where the drugs were directed, and to decline the "Little Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for measures, which have stopped a large number of drugs directed to Australia," introduced her Executive Director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is because of the high-term price of drugs atractive target for their pastures.
The ground is also involved with the growth of the number of people of drug sufferings.
This is not the first time.
Last month, three men were accused of transmission of a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to interpret the Titian Sea in a small aircraft.
The elders don't feel awesome, they have to remember them.
The problem may be in the houses for seniors, the solution, according to the medicine of the Geriatric Clinics of the Global Faculty hospital in Prace Paul Madloes, could be the infusion of the physiological disorder that is the egg under the kitchen.
But you're still applied only to healthy devices.
As a man's older, more than a lot of waters in his body.
"And even losing feelings seriously, so the elders usually accept less technology and very quickly dehydrate," said the Madlo.
Two letters should be drinking certain.
"But get to a old man so much technology is a big problem," added.
In the houses for the elders often no doctor looks at it.
In hospitals, dehydrates are usually infected.
"I think there should also be a procedure to achieve a suburb infuse," she said.
On the day, the old people can add to two half-litre lakes of physiological disorder.
The failure of the technology can make smallness, pain of heads and decreased exercise.
Dehydration is appeared as an easy loss of society.
"Any day, the old man will say that he can't rise out of bed, he's talking slowly," added.
In the case of an injury, it can be raised up until the brain adjustment.
The blood is deceived and deceived in the brain, also the failure of the lead.
Leading patients should not be covered by the max. bathed space.
The problem may also be a single entirely full.
"It's a higher officer, but it would be ideal to find a patient sometimes and to leave the ability to win," she brought the doctor.
In Dubai, the second marakodrap The Torch
At the fifth of Dubai, one of the largest residents of the world's world's branches had to evacuate all 337 meters of high and 79 pattern buildings.
For the last two years, the second fire of this high building is already made by the appropriate name The Torch (Ooddenj).
evacuated were all the building citizens and didn't get any destruction. The cause of fire is not known.
“ We spread and built our alarm, and we heard the cry.
We've been ten minutes before we went down from the 50th mother," he said to Reuters Geroge, one of the citizens.
Dubai citizens defenced that the hazards were able to get fire under control around four hours morning (0:00 GMT), and continued to build building.
The official representatives added that they ensure replacement for the posted citizens.
Incident could again choose discussions on the safety of materials used to cover high buildings throughout the world.
From the results of the investigation started the guide of Turch's driving after the fire in 2015, the most exploited cloud and external panels used for decoration or isolation.
The British police stated that the isolation system and the cloud of the London Grenfell Tower could be accessed to the fast scanning of fire at the June fire, where at least 80 people were lost.
The results of the investigation showed that more than one of the five travellers in the United States provides prohibited targets on the airport.
The investigation between travelers showed that more than twenty per cent of them knowing or uncertainly have been prohibited under the control of the United States Government Agency of Transport Security Administration on the airport. At least six percent of the traveling aircraft with a feet or another aspect.
Less than one percent of travelers say that they continued to discover their guns, municipalities or explosions.
From the results of the investigation, which carried out Stratos Jet Charters Inc., and responded to more than 1000 questionnaires, he exclaimed that in younger traveling is the greatest probability of disappearing the rules.
From the answers who agreed that they were trying to travel with the proposal prohibited by the TSA was 19.7 per cent of traveling with several thousand hours in comparison with less than 15 per cent of the members of the X Generation.
Through the most common objectives of the TSA’s attention, food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of the responses of scientists have been able to prevent a warranty objective, while 2,2 per cent of women asked and 3,7 per cent of men also agreed that they were fully carried out on the aeroplane.
The Community declared that she had carried out the research between traveling throughout the world to find how many of them were made unlawful objectives through aeroplane control and how much it has been approved.
I don't surprise that most people who have transported unlawed subjects - to know or not - travel aeroplane very often.
As the company has submitted, the TSA Directives are just complicated and mathematical.
People often don't know what technology and how much they can pronounce in the airport.
So I'm not surprised that the TSA has been able to cut out in the largest number of technology.
Sometimes people thought that the TSA would put the books in the same way as with the rewarded goods.
The transfer of the technology is authorised in the context of tumors, not in any international.
Boss EPA Scott Pruitt on the payment of planned directives to reduce Obamo's administrative emissions
Since the Agency for Environment Protection was invited to 15 States, her boss Scott Pruitt rejected its previous decision on the implementation of the old Obamo's Administratives on reduction of carbon oxyd emissions.
The triutt presented changes in its plan, and it reacts so lower than the previous governments on the needs of States environmental regulators.
Nevertheless, he noted the legal excuse given against his previous position at the federal Court of Justice.
This is the last term laid down on 1 October when the States should begin to fulfil the Regulation from 2015 to reduce the quantity of the area.
In June, Pruitt announced that the agreement was deleted for a year and made a more detailed study of the plan, to “the agreement with local decisions or a serious economic growth”.
The prime, which remained the position of the Secretary-General of Oklahoma, before the EPA Board of President Donald Trump, served for a long time as a comprehensive refund of the environmental Regulations.
Since he was sitting in Washington, Pruitt was repeatedly moved or displaced the regulation proposed by chemical and fossil industry.
Increasing medical reputation is the greatest legal success for the Pryutto regulatory agent.
The last month of the federal chair of the Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA had exceeded its authority in order to decline the cluster of the Obamo's Administrative Plan, which requested to reduce the employment of the offices of the field.
In the report published in the middle of the evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and sent the EPA commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and the implementation of new standards in the given time framework.
“For the previous Government of the EPA has often not fulfilled the terms and expected to be invited to the active groups and others, agreed with the equality and other plans established,” said Pruitt, who put the EPA in his previous position more than one of the requirements.
“We don't believe in the regulation by means of judicial sports and fulfillment of the terms we are seriously.
We never deny our statute and authority that describes from it."
However, the EPA states that Pruitt can be used in certain points “the possibility of delivery and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that the regulations will be based on health policy and non-accessible information.
Republics in the Congress are pressed on more larger ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month encourages the implementation rules from 2015 at least eight years.
The measures still have not been seen by the senate.
The New Yorker General Procurator Eric Schneiderman, who stayed in the coalicies of the states who requested the EPA this week, declared that the group would not agree to authorize the legal claim.
“Show in the EPA views - following our court over - is an important winning for health and security of those 6,7 million newspapers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly involved in pollution, ” added Schneiderman.
In New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pensylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone is exceeded when the normal smoking substances carried out, electrical, oil rafinery, chemical electronic and other sources are reacted in the atmosphere with the sun-infection.
The resulting effort may cause serious breath problems in citizens, and every year and thousands of previous deaths.
The public health and environmentalists gain the change of Pruitto with a view to.
"It's concerned how the cup is to exceed to change the thoughts of the responsible persons and protect air that we respirate," said Lori Ann Burdo from the Biology Diversity Centre.
"We have to continue with the ideal threat of the Trumpo's administratives that are trying to help criminals and special interests."
Polil man's injury, but it's not dangerous.
You never know what can happen to you.
In one moment you're home with your family and you're laughing, in the other, you will change your whole life from the bases.
And the worst is that you can't do anything with it.
The similar condemnation found Andreas Christopherose from the Great Britannical, who was cutting his face with an unknown attacker who was finally made a sin.
Information online Reuters.
In procent 2014, somebody in Christophers stole on the door.
Andreas thought he's going to open.
He had to say that after the door, he's probably a curriculum that had to get the day of the wedding gift for the family.
Instead of that, he was waiting for a cruel surprise.
A man who never saw him in life, immediately when he opened him without warning, he said, "This is for you, friend."
That pain was unbelievable.
The shadows fell on me as nothing, and I felt just an unexpected pain on the hair," he said Andreas.
The family moved him quickly to the hospital, but his neighbors learned a terrible message - according to the doctors he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks from the accident, the doctors had no longer fear that their patient had the infection that was terrified to go to his rank.
His pain was very serious.
From the ninety-year percent, the face that the doctors tried to get together using the cock from the other parts of the body of the patient.
A great complication for Christopherose became the loss of eyes.
It's probably the most amazing thing I've lived.
"You can't hide your eyes before the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," described his threat.
Today Christopheros has 12 operations that are not the last.
The Lords who suffer the victims of the axylene can require hundreds of chirurg systems and years of treatment according to plastic chirurgs.
Even after a periodic and long-term treatment, they have victims of stone detected until the end of life.
"It's sometimes that people don't worry and live against deformation and revolution," said Professor Peter Diewulski, speaking the British association of plastic and estetic chirurgs.
The shooter's gone.
What about the attack, Christopheros is sure that the unknown man had to share him with someone.
The Pakistan truly believed that he had a man who had sexually deceived his neighborhood.
The police's entire case has been monitored, and the assassin's exploitation has exposed.
The husband was originally condemned for at least eight years of prison.
However, later, Christopheros' family had a significant change.
"Thre judges finally succeeded to conclude that the trespass should be interrupted, because the man is not considered to be a threat for publicity," said Christopheros.
In the past few years, the number of infections of hydrautic substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry's inner office was expressed to the problem so that it plans to establish new provisions to the State Prosecutors in respect of the classification of the guarantee.
You should be held between the dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of similar attacks are not agreed to give.
They require that the Government of the Great Britannical Government makes more accurate and more challenges to reject the freedom of people who are attached to their roads or other hydrates.
In addition, they require to be comprehensive controls of sales of dangerous substances that are often to get in various trades, because it is one of the various cleaning environments.

China is trying to apply its effect without use of powers.
A year of 10 billion dollars for the support of language schools and the universe in the frontier, pressing their inner industry on the foreign market and trying to attach the west tourists.
But that doesn't happen to Beijing.
The State media talks about the plan to make the tourism the strength of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of foreign loins increased only 3,8 per cent and over 80 per cent of tourists in China came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Tchaj-wana.
It is more than that, even throughout all its global aspiration, China, the stranger is likely opened, values the situation in the world's leadership of the world's economy professor of the Peking University of Christopher Balding in an article for the Bloomberg agent.
For example, which speaks for everything, is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a non-wide steel with China, and those others have to make a visa with the presence.
Thus, in the United States, the data are comparable to the celebrations of the new year of China.
The wine is 140 dollars, but if a man doesn't want to wait for a long time in the front, he must pay 100 dollars and more for additional services.
Such limits build significant economic restrictions.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need of knowledge reduces the number of visitors of 70 per cent.
In 2015, the Peking China visited only two million Americans, while Hongkong, which shared in a huge home product of China in less than three percent and lived in less than one percent of all the citizens, visited 1,8 million Americans.
China often deploys this problem when tourist moves to implement its political goals, for example, in sports with Thai-wan and South Korea.
When China restricted the travel to South Korea in the framework of the south Korean antirake system, the South Koreans cut it out and China cut off.
In May, the number of visits was amounted to 42 per cent, while Japan was 85 per cent of growth.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to recently published reports of the United States Central Bank Fed, China could have rejected the foreign paths of China until 190 billion dollars, while China sells the changes of tourists in the framework of adventure of annually gets about 35 billion dollars.
According to the official numbers of payment balances, China has had 217 billion dollars in the tourism, which is equal to 44 per cent of the China's total residence in the trade.
Thus, the small number of tourists of the country that is increasingly striving the capital's difference is very painful.
The higher factors, however, are only one of the most common manners of the foreign.
In many places of China, nobody has heard about immigrants.
In 2013, there was less than million citizens in China.
More of them are in the United States and some individual cities.
The Japanese, which is not just a cross-creasing approach, has a double-line.
The number of scientific works show that the immigrants usually live economic growth, business and innovation.
However, in China you will not find them practically.
The solution of these problems will be politically cruel, but the step that is offered is the degradation of the water parallel.
Other Asian States, especially India and Vietnam, have a great effort to reduce and delay procedures during the training of wine.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard changes, it should be easier to get there.

Maskr on Moore's Ford: Activists remember rasistic ringing
Ford Mercury from 1948 went around the visiting citizens of Monroe, Georgia and kodrcal to the monster Moore's Ford.
However, before he carried with four black passengers and the white driver was able to get to the monster, he gathered him a group of whites with weapons.
The manager of the group - a middle age in the pitched clothes - a long time he went out of the cigarette and looked at the white steel of the car.
Inside the traveling tricks were scared.
"We want that n-- and Roger." The man cried.
"Bring him to me!"
It's silent to interrupt the river of a young black, which is raised out of the officer's seat.
This scene is happy only the rebuilding events that occurred on June 22.
But when one of the men overcomes the Roger's crown, the obsession will be lowly disappointed.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford returns regularly a group of activists who rebuild it in the night of 1946, when two black pairs were - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of Kukluxklan.
Nobody was judged for murder.
“ It is not the only person who has been arrested for all these years, though we still see them in our community; even when we know their identity, ” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the rebuilding events.
"It's crazy in our history and crazy in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year Congressman of Georgia and a comprehensive fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes, the rebuilding of dramatic events to end, and the community of the city of Monroe reminds that righteousness was not done enough.
"We need a judicial excuse and closement of the case, we want peace in the mind and the distress, but in particular justice," said Brooks.
“The health and health process cannot be started until that time.”
The court doctor covers July 27, 1946 one of the body of the ransom sacrifices in Moore's Ford.
Following the NBC News reports of the FBI, the shipment had to participate to 50 men from Monroe and environmental periods.
However, no one was still in court.
Although the survey remains ten years after freedom, the representative of the citizen laws say that both reasons of struggling - policy and sex - were known to all citizens.
In April 1946, the Court of the Highest Black Court of Georgia had the right to first participate in the choices planned for the year.
And just at the time of a yearly choice, the FBI had a black farmer of Roger Malcom during the shipment of the grounds of the white field of Barnett Hester, in particular because of his wife.
In the city, he believed that Hester met Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her to another state.
By the explanation of the FBI, the 25th July 1946, the most important ground officer of Loy Harrison for Malcom's catch was 600 dollars.
Dorothy and the brothers of Mae Murray and George Dorsey brought him to prison.
When he returned from the prison, just before he came in to Moore's Ford, they gathered a group of overseers.
"How it was shown, the murder planned and organized Harrison," she led the FBI.
“It is also obvious that the secret agreement has arrived between State and local law protectors, who participated not only in the ransom, but also have been freed and held the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks expressed stronger.
“It was masker because of the election law," he said.
"Always there was a clear subtext for all local citizens of black steel: 'This is the case if you are recording and going to vote'."
A yearly rebuilding events in the Moore's Ford is organized at least ten years of Cassandra Greene.
Her imagination is pictured, thick and high. It shows the deep-rounded rasism that many would like to think in modern America for disappearance.
Seeing this rebuilding is not easier, and it is still difficult to turn the face, but Greene says that it's their sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lying, because we have to get the unfair feelings that are hidden in each of us," said Greene.
“But we can't have a relationship, if you don't understand what I had to go.”
The main trials of air rebuilding started in June, and immediately the first day, at least 30 hercs - tts of whites, the rest of black - came to the room where Greene was known with a very closely planned presentation.
Wade Marbaugh executes the location of the assistant.
A lot of years he played the leader of Kuklucklan, but his word is a role to be explored.
"I have a bad feeling, because it's against whom I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think this part of the history is very important to meet regularly because we never want to return to this time."
Herci Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom's role, the Barnett Hester, are raising their role.
The presentation starts with a puzzle - Malcom is coming to Hester and causes him to sleep with his wife.
"Take out of my ground, N-e!"
Rascona can't.
He's coming to the puzzle.
At that time, everyone (except every heritage of black flowers) will be explored in smileys.
Greene's fun of all.
"What happened?" Rascon's question.
He's crazy.
I was so gray?
"No," Greene's happy.
"I don't just think that the whites then called 'n-r' a tongue.'
"Really," one of the herds will blow a black steel.
"You have to call a bigger rate on R."
Energy in the room is the best; enemy replaces the feelings of close.
Everyone wants to be authentic, just to be done for the victim of the massacre.
The hearts repeat the scene.
Rascona this time steadfastly on the right statement of the words on N.
There's no one to sleep now.
Presentation ends strongly and fast.
Call, shooter... and silence.
The woman clothed in the black stands over the body of the herds and takes a smooth song of Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word, it's in the room to feel disgusting.
On the ground of all of this, like, thousands of watching people will lose potters and slides out of the eyes.
In the obsession, the same number of black and whites is the same.
One couple came from New York Ithacy, a lot of watching them from the nearby area.
Each of them steals the local skins at least eight hours and Brooks is led to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
At this moment, the murder could be looked at a distance, but now, standing on the same place where it came to steal, the atmosphere is horrible.
With the last words, Greene calls Greene's dawn to the inspection of the body.
Children look to the heads of the victim, see false blood and bad body and ask something to the ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy hurts.
It shows a couple of minutes and Greene thanks to the obsession.
The herds smoke the lane and shoot the slides.
Bradshaw's marbaugh, a man in the cloud that played the Leader Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona, we're both our two friends of hero, and we're drowning in their hands. Finally, they're emotional.
"It's okay," one of the woman's asshole.
"We know that the role is done to you.
But you had a reason for that."
After that day, we're sitting together with the brain to the dinner.
On one table, a young white couple has been able to talk about the presentation of a black park with which they have been known today.
Denise Duplinski's challenge found a word that would express her feeling from the present presentation.
“ It is difficult to listen to these amazing words and to look at the worse acts... who end people who look like you and do it because they look like you, ” she said to rebuild.
“I don't want to know that the plot is still the current subject,” he added, “It's just a police officer.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits on the court side, and he's cutting food and talking about the citizen rights.
For its own words, he has already started planning a presentation for the next year.
“ Reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to survive -- it is just a moment to discuss, ” said.
"If we don't learn from that one who knows... it could happen again.
People who don't know and do not study his history are judged to react it."
I love advantages to use.
One of my friends says you're just reading the money.
I don't listen to it.
It's about one of the modern forms of science, often a surrealism.
With the nastalgies, I remember for a long time, where the cost of use of whatever was often raritic.
So my first graphphone contained only one paper on which heroglyphs were showing some parts, there were some secret tags in all.
When I showed something inside, I offered him a list to Shaman, who didn't want to cut off the back board.
He advised me to what the only paper with a labyrine is right.
Yeah, he went about a regular help in the chronical depth of the toalet paper.
The game found the launched kid and allowed me to listen to the dear vinyl cupcakes.
The new time has brought new reviews.
The relatively simple fruits of the fruits, where he just got the override grep, required about ten images.
Especially, it was carried out with a description how to move one part into the other.
The preparation was double and another procedure was just impossible.
It has been required a significant effort on the need to decline certain gas parts.
My exhibition is finished in my self-moving Seat Leon's tag.
The year of the production of 2003 was still a book with the introduction of detailed resources, including the exchange of blinkur requirements.
It was easy.
Three steps and work should be ready.
Awesomely, the author of the relief forgot that, while the lead went right to replace it only in three steps.
Section 1. Crystal.
2. Put the smoke of the smoke and shoot the new.
3. Put a cross.
The left shirt had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cross.
In the beginning, I felt that I put the right top bottom into the bottom of our cars to a certain cup, a rubber that is easily separated and then I'll be guided by points 1 to 3 of the useful writer of the service book.
I think the hairs.
The crisis had no place, no space nor for the smoking hand of the Population, so the shadow of Slezan.
I lost half hours of my life, and that's all without any success.
Stave was still able to enter my wife into the garage that he called the market and the words that heard out of my mouth was very exclusively.
"What are you doing here?" she asked, "What are you doing here?"
My response was about 90 seconds, although if I leave the volgary terms, only two published words.
I'm changing the shoes.
"And why is it so long for you?" she risked a wind that could be the last in the long-term shirt.
I late explained to her a problem, because I had mainly attempted to the progress of the torture of the author of the guidance, where the blessing of the broken yellow on the hands that she wrote, it would make sure that he could never write anything, was only a result in the wide floor of Kladiva's guideline, including his Commission approval on the top of the Russian cluster.
"What's this way to mount this box?" The woman's mounting battery.
In black disagreement, the step 1-3 was as easy and fast as at the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And it's the day when he called me a colleague who just went out of the stage after controling the two State Affairs Officers for the control of the medicine.
I know her as a colleague equipped, which has been able to make it possible, and he can also express the wonderful story of an unresolved voice.
"Present that I have received a trial for that I haven't been raised by the hands," he said to me with a loud voice.
I went out of him, and I made the whole problem that he threatened in that there's no image training on the toalth of the patients, how to meet the hands.
His argument of the Commission Office that he has grown up by his hands, and that it is not necessary for icons to ensure it as a common activity of gentlemen, it has no valuable effect and has been a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she made him.
He realized that the simple exploitation of the exploited water is a primitive task on the level of the absence that the modern human, Homo sapiens sapiens, leads this urgency in ten steps.
So it's necessary to describe that it's necessary to leave from the water cow.
The entire process has 11 points, but at the end it is happy to find that a man has laid his hands exactly as he calls him a host from SOUKLU.
Finally, I have to realize that I had to inspire and prepare a detailed plan for toalet.
In the question of defence, there will be an individual procedure, there will not be a problem, in view of a certain difference of both heads, it will be necessary to explane two expenditures.
The problem remains the icons because the creation of the perfect progress means and the exact range of all anatomical details, which could be raised in a toaletic visitor of a certain toaleta, while it can finally be realized that the appropriate opening has been made throughout his life.
The Pearson company leaves other 3000 employees and reduces the division in order to survive trade

Conversion in Kabulu: NATO soldiers were killed at their own murder explosion
The self-sharing attorney attacked the military convention in the main city of Afganistan Kabul. At the attack, one of the NATO soldiers died, and some others were destroyed, they brought official representatives.
Five soldiers and throaters were destroyed in the NATO statement.

The Nasili has already submitted a serious situation in Afghanistan and President of the United States Donald Trump increasing the increase of the number of American soldiers that should help military units and police members in the country.
According to the reports, its own murder attacks have been carried out for the last weeks of public confidence in the Government, its Regulation, and particularly in the reputacy of President Asšrafa Ghanina.
The EPA in response to the claim decided its decision to decline the payment rules.
The American Agency for Environment Protection has rejected its decision on the law of Obamo's Administrators, which invited States to reduce emissions, and that is the only day after the Agency requested 15 States.
The EPA announced its decision to establish the ‘Ozone Standards 2015’ in the middle-night hours’, saying that the obligation of the co-operation Agency for States is provided.
“We believe in the dialogue with our state partners and let's hear their opinions,” said the EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
In June, the EPA tried to decline ozone standards, which measure real pollution of air in specific areas of the country and, based on measures, determine the limits to be fulfilled until October 2018.
The 15 group of most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., has made an excuse with the reason that the EPA operation is unlawful.
The President Donalda Trumpa supports the measurement of many environmental regulations proposed by the ex-President Barack Obama - in accordance with the Trump words, in order to achieve economic growth.
However, the new Government scheme started promotion from democracy and concert groups that fear the impact of emergency on public health.
EPA on its web pages indicates that airhold with the content of ozone can “amount the fishing functions and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as as as astma.
The song of Ladislav Bubnar got blood!
This, with us a regular new song, you may have already registered in June this year when this new song has been held at least known to us on the territory of the Chinese monster action, on which he hosted such preceding personality as Mr. Karel God, Lucie White, Simon Krain and others, and the action has been sick than Leoh Maresh.
The target was easy, showing publicity and imagining his music video club to the song of Sarah, whose baptism was just called personality.
Some people already know that the only video clips in Russia was not made without problems and the single song Ladislav Bubnar had to be watched.
It was his first big attack with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it wasn't obvious.
The writer Sarah is very emotic and is based on the unfortunate love of two thousands.
For the dramaticity of the scene had a lot of facky range in the video clips of music.
However, at a moment he threw him so strong and directly into the nose that a young song had to watch the doctor.
"I was a morning, I didn't expect it, I immediately started from blood's nose," commented Ladislav.
The colleagues and producers said that he went to the worst convention and Ladislav did not react in time.
Happiness was not so serious to influence continuing in the next approach.
We're now bringing you a mixed video clip of a young artist, you can also record it with a dream.
The non-provided version of blood, however, it wasn't enjoyed.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko talked on the meeting of the opportunities of each other
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxes who could inscend the less boxer boxers in easy ships were first met at the outside meetings.
Each of them was located in a solo room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - unresolved champion in the light board of World Boxing Council - didn't go down to the shore where Lomačenka, champion in the Peripheral Office of World Boxing Organization.
After the winning of Garcia on the basis of a single decision against the Old World Shampion Adrien Broner in the Sunday Saturday, both boxes were achieved on the list of five best boxers in the light ship.
Garcia found her right hand and said: “How is it, damn?
Good luck."
Lomachenka is occupied on Saturday at 19:00 by the title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN.
The boxers are carried out for photographs and manager Lomačenka Egis Klimas adds that the potential boxers would be a “ perfect trial”.
"I am an old champion in the perimeter ship," adds Garcia.
“ I had to take 67 kg because of the ransom with Broner (67 kg), but I was not so big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the category of easy weights.
We have to get a lot of sight again, then we can get out.
After that, the fans likes it.
Why don't they fulfill it."
It's a lot of conformity.
"The box would be the box."
Climas took the request for a payment for the view - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should solve its debut in the easy ship at the end of the year and the next year to escape with Garcio (37-0, 30 knockouts), which also expressed interest in the winning of Jorge Linares in s. Luke Campbell, who run 23. September on the title of the league driving and Forum.
“ The tax should be able to pay for a looking, they ask fans, ” said Garcia, who later explained that it was opened to send a pack through the TV station that will come with the best offer.
“We're the main attractions.
Nobody else will take a look at himself like this.
We're waiting for the right opportunity."
Garcia showed that he recognizes Lomachen as a "wunderful boxer" and could participate in his sabbath story.
Lomachenka didn't give Garcia to praise when he said that the Shampion had three divisions of Riverside seems to be "will be very late... sorry, Mike, but you're talking about the knockout."
Garcia said that his goal was to show the strength and then the box.
Both of the boxes said that they felt that they're steadfast infringement before the one's duty.
“ You don't just remember this shirt.
There's no other shooting to yourself so much attention.
And I'll put into the fire with great joy," said Garcia.
Lomačenko said, "I was waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great shit."
A young couple of years ago, he lost no feet.
They've found their car now on Volhy's day.
Two young Russians Ilia Viirnov and Kira Čerkasov were denied since December 2005.
They've seen a lot of patterns, unfortunately.
And the police finally ended for the lack of evidence of investigation.
The families of a lost couple lived in the absence that they don't know what the couple happened.
After 12 years, the whole story's end was comforted.
The front of their car found a lack of training on the day of the Volhy River in Cheboksary City in Czech.
Only thanks to the records that remained in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The evidence survived by the whole decade under the water, without them the police would continue to discover the identity of those found.
The couple was recently seen when Lirnov left the car from his father to bring his friend out of the work.
The car that found the car is still in anonymous.
His neighbor reported the Cheboksar police that the next day the car went out to the plane.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that has caused the road path around the river.
However, the monitoring continues, after its end, further details will be published.
The most recent results of the tests for establishing age limits of asylum in Sweden
The most recent results of the asyl tests in Sweden, which have been detailed by new methods of exceeding their age, show that over 80 percent of people were asked as 18 years old, but not everyone believes their exactness.
The Sweden Forenz Medicine Agency (RÃ ts medicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of the aeroplane year.
The objective of the method is more appropriate to assess the assessment requirements in the framework of assessment. In measures, the Swedish Migration Office (Migrationsverket) was criticised in the determination of the right age of certain exploitors who were lying for their age.
To this date, the Sweden migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency now published the results of 2481 tests since the half of March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was conducted as an elder 18 years, while the Forenz Medical Agency in 25 other cases was asked that the question was “possibly older 18 years”.
In addition, 423 cases were decided that the question was “possibly younger than 18 years”.
Tests are accessible only in case, if the age of the demanded age is sport.
According to Johana Güörransson, the results of the Forenz Medical Agency correspond to the previous month.
“In contrast the past month, statistics are maintained in employees and numbers are very similar,” said The Local.
The higher number of trailers whose age was deceived for 18 years did not mean that the axis lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and declared that in 442 cases it was found that “the person was 18 years or older”.
News of Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 public cases and found that in 243 cases he asked that he would have 18 years.
Criticals were also expected to be a medical method of definition of the age that includes the rentgen of wisdom doses and the MRI scans of colen crowds, which follows the dawns and rentgenologists.
One of the boxes is Claude Marcus from the Carolin Institute, which is in other cases the biological exceedingness of people to determine the age when the topic passed into the pubert.
“I had a reason to think about this problem, and I don't think that these types of measures for age are right.
Biological age review is in sure that it is extremely increasing.
If we can't definite an earlier, we shouldn't be able to preserve the reaction," he brought for the Metro news.
The Forenzial Medicine Agency's GÃ ̈ransson's decision said: “You can say that the risk of unjustness of child as a adult is small.
The highest risk represents the fact that the demanded person is increasingly under the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all demanded."

Financing's going to think something, and finally it's fine.
"But if you're gonna say that Mexico's won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to get with you anymore, because it's not acceptable for me," said the American journal Trump.
However, the wall marked the most important thing we talk about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
The Executive Command for the Construction of the Trump gave it shortly after the power.
Mexican design and financing walls rejects a length of 3300 kilometers, because of this, both countries have been heavy.

"Obviously, you can say that this isn't the agreement you created, but you'll have to keep it," said Trump Turnball.
In some passages, there was a telephone talk with Turnbull at least juvial, for example, when Trump evaluated as a good idea of Australian refusal to accept the exploitation in the members.
"You're worse than me," threw Trump.
But this conversation has been exceedingly excited.
"I hate accepting these people," advised Trump.
I assure you that they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for the local medicine," he said.
In the conversation, he also understood that the surrounding can be a five-year-old attorney from Boston.
Trump led to the end of the year, so a week after the arrival of the white house, telephone conversations with the world's room, often and sometimes in one day.
Hovor with Turnbull finally marked the less favorable day.
Before he finished him, he exclaimed that he had a pleasant conversation with the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Before I gave it, Ranny's murdered.
She's looking at her father.
The training was on the town in Jemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose a little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi's girl shoot, took her father's house where he was hungry and shocked her with a hot hand.
Lastly he deceived her body, and then he deceived near the smoke.
The wormful death of a little girl took a entire land that caused the worm of the citizen war.
Yahya Almatari stayed in the first series of thousands of billion, which came to be a witness of transport.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was judged under the right of the shadow.
The father of the victim's victim's post-proof made a medium of his feelings.
I feel renewed.
It's gone to me.
It's a new day of my life.
And the other members of the family were present, together with the dawn cried the password "to live righteousness."
The officer brought the police addiction from which he was exhausted.
Policists put him on the board.
One of the companions against him turned out his weapons, and from the middle nearest nearby he struck the palm.
The present gift has glorified every morning that was burned.
Mr Al Almatari said to MailOnline that justice was conducted in accordance with the legal system of the country.
"The righteousness, the Alah and the right of the shadows have gathered," he added.
I stayed on the Nancy's freedom, and I was waiting for murdering my daughter.
Then we went to marriage with our family.
We took Ranino's dead bodies and buried him on a remote sepulchre.
I and my wife Jamileh are thanks for justice.
The police feared that the dawn collected on the tent would fall for an abomination, the murder will fall and smile.
The procedure was established by the court that is under the administration of the Shift Hutties.
But originally, Maghrabi was judged once after the arrest was sent to 100 rans, but his action resurrected such destructions that the judge decided for death.
Al Maghrabi was locked two days after a girl's missing June 27.
The famous family knew him well.
When the police looked for his house, she showed evidence that his man was planning.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creation.
What could be his motive?
And the animal would be most merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the suffering that was not Ranno's body was terrible," said the medicine.
"Rana left afternoon, and the day we reported it to the police, and we told the news and all our television stations, flowers with her photos of glass everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks that the police got a tip from murder parents who understood their son from a severe case.
The girl, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
The morning was going to play out with the other children of the concubine.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where she is.
We were looking for everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We went around our block, our friends took the car and walked around, but we were looking for fun.
The residents of Jemen were disappointed by crime and started gathering before the police station where Al Maghrabi was held and required an immediate challenge.
The Ministry of Justice Procedure read the present report of investigation to calm them.
The accused, according to all, did not demonstrate his commitment.
Policists read him the judgments, but the jurisdiction just looked at his trafficker.
The whole event was attached to the national TV, but on the Internet there were many records that gave.

In addition to the property of the young fronts, Savov figured in Harvestor Limited company with a sister on Cyprus, which controlled the Checobudijov pivour Samson, and in the cyper company of Marafle, which is profiled as an investment fund, which buys a threat activity.

As the financial rules of the photoball influence Neymar to Paris
The restricting rules of financing European photoball clubs will not exceed Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to France Paris-Saint Germen.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be performed by the EUFA organization, which corresponds to European photoball teams and has the right to deny the teams to participate in the Press Lice of Masters.
Financial fair game (FFP) which has introduced the EUFA in 2011 states that PSG should be demonstrated that Neymar's transition was not financed without great loss.
Barcelona paid a total of 222 million EUR only to buy Neymar from his contract and Neymar will require a lot of $10 million each year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
While the PSG team is financed by a rich parent family that was rich for energy selling, Neymara may be allowed to bring Neymar to such a star football family.
Clubs can lose for the purchase of players of several parts, but on the other hand, they must demonstrate legal resources of advantages, which allows them to enhance the regulatory costs of trade activities related to the photoball.
FFP carried out Michel Platini after the EUFA director in 2007.
The French player believed that the clubs that are in the honour of new offices are in the final result, and risk bankrots if banks or holders are refused to ensure.
In 2011, the FFP rules changed their attention from club debts to monitor their loss.
This change signed that the business model that used Roman Abramovič with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with the potential and lost the horizon sums for the player and build a global tag - it was not so appropriate.
In the framework of the current three-year trial trial period, which ends in 2018, the clubs can demonstrate loss to over 30 million EUR.
And in addition to Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his prosecutor Alexander Cheferin was decided to prevent the command of overall losses.
“The FFP Pravide still pays, and we decide to send them in the future,” said the last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, which respects the FFP rule.
Although the PSG offered a quantity for the purchase of Neymara in a single payment, it may be possible for the purposes of accounting amount to distribute to the full length of the contract.
Neymar signed the five years of the Treaty, so the transfer can be decreased to 44,4 million EUR each year after five years.
The first field of the highest sanctions of FFP was held in 2014 PSG together with Manchester City, which is the own group of Abu Dhabi.
The PSG was raised up to 60 million euros (82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros, and ordered to reduce Ligy's mastership on 21 players in the 2014-2015 section, instead of 25 players.
The EUFA provides attention to the teams that can try to prevent financial regulators by highlighting their advantages through society associated with clubs.
While, therefore, the PSG is confronted as the financing exceeds the standard market rates, the EUFA has the right to deny the calculation of the parts.
In 2014, the EUFA has arrived in the same measures, since it decided that the higher financial measures provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team were too high.
The Part of Neymar Agreements in the PSG may be submitted to some reports from the MS organization Commission in the Photoball 2022 in Katar.
However, the PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Katara said that Neymat should be an ambassador of MS in the photoball and that such manufacturers would easily disappear the UEFY operators.
The previous sanctions established by the PSG means that the EUFA will be carefully monitored by any intention to protect the rules,
The EUFA has not started in the transition of Neymara to the PSG investigation according to the outcome stated persons.
The resource of this report would like to stay in anonymity because it was not authorised to comment with the PSG, the agent The Associated Press.
Recently published accounts show that the PSG has closed the year 2015-2016 with clean losses of 10 million EUR and the review of 542,4 million EUR.
The accounts for the current financial year were not yet published.
PSG expects that Neymara's arrival will be a large opportunity for sponsors, mercandising and sales of dress.
The Club promises the increase of return to 30% from the signature of the Treaty.
The representatives of the Spanish ligs, obviously concerned with one of the largest stars, murdered Neymar's department, argumenting that PSG disappears the FFP rules.
“It's a clear case of the Financial Doping Club and State,” said the President La Ligy Javier Teba for Spanish AS news, referring to the property of the PSG PSG Club.
Manager Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose own American sport magnetic club, shares the same positions La Ligy on the funding of the club.
“It's the consequence of the property that from the bases has changed the photobal world in the last 15 years, ” left Wenger to hear in the fourth century.
“ As the owner of the club becomes, it is possible.
Management of financial fair game rules is very difficult because State may have different interests in participating such players in your club."
Sparistan booker Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Seventeen thousand aplauding fans on the feet.
Tomas Russian's on the board.
It's the same scene as in the week-day explosion against Bohemians.
The Sparistan writer shocked against the Blue Zenda Game, imagined a number of eggs, but his partners didn't die to the black.
The Aeroplane team has been packed by new multimillion forces, so after the conventional doubles in the European fields.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belarus' side?
After the insected part, it was necessary to shoot four, which was hard for us.
We wouldn't at least want to win, to make ourselves understanding that we should get out of what to get to the other challenges.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get so long?
The game is horrible.
Combination of supports was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything. We just shoot once.
Of course, it's a little bit when you have to play two or three goals.
The second half time was a lot better, in the final third, we could play with them.
But you have to suffer more often to touch such positions.
Is there a big number of changes in the set?
Of course, it's one of the pain when a new man's creation.
We just disappeared three concurrent shoes and the session still changes.
It's about to find the trainer the ideal eleventh that sits.
Is it a surprise for you that you have already ran out the part of two packs after you?
It's still part of the fucking.
I don't know how my status is going to get out and when I can play finally from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it's not.
It's the same as the pain.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta decided, we must be optimist, and the situation will be worse.
The fanuss came back in a large number, but they went out in the packs.
What can you tell them?
It was a wonderful visit, like God.
I'm sorry we can't make them a better exercise.
To bring something for what they're coming and the next.
We can thank them for getting up.
I don't remember these visits when I played here for 15 years ago.
Can it be sezoned without a shoes at least for the people?
We're fighting ourselves, we're afraid, so that's not such an issue for us.
For extreme payment business, the employee has ten years to sit away.
The Court of Justice rejected the duty of Jiri Toman's companies, who has to be carried out in a significant field to pay ten years in prison.
Calculated challenge makes 645 million corners.
Toman stated that the justice has violated his fundamental rights, the effective detection of courts in Zilena and the Olympics are not fully fulfilled.
However, the Courts of Justice have marked worthlessness, and the CTK detected from the Court's database.
The U.S. isn't another challenge judge.
"It is not as a fourth instance to ensure effective or legal doubts which have been fully authorised by the general courts, if they do not propose the prohibition of the rights and freedom of laws."
Toman was judged as a hurry.
Verdikt is powerful since November 2015 when he confirmed the Court of Justice in Olympic.
Toman was then in Argentina's exhibition, where he was also in the United Nations decision.
The saved challenge is at the top border of the legal rate, which is responsible for the excessive disease.
The Court of Justice has marked the extern payment assessment that has a macroeconomic impact on the State budget.
In 2005 to 2008, the man was made as President of the representative of the World Services.
Case of 645 million corners has only been taken for a period from January to July 2008, and the total employment has increased a billion.
However, because of the process reasons, it was not possible to judge Toman for a total number.
According to the requirements of the World Services, the companies did not include their payment recognition of all factors.
In place of monthly DPH and consumer data in lines, at least 10 million corners paid the payment in only statistics.
World Services and some companies with which the company traded, have a relationship with the companies of the Radomiri Electoral, which has made justice for a machinery with DPH in trade with 13 years of prison.
He also rejected his duty before the Holy Court.
Serials "Laughter to Insurance" and "Comrade Detective" play on the north-giant stream
This historic is nostalgic as for the positions of the celebration of 80 years; so for the 90th year (when the genes David Wain and Michael Showalter led to the MTV comedial scanner "The State", and, of course, for modern time, especially 2001 before the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Ruddre were developed to major projects.
As a cultural artefact, it's easy parody, and also the fulfillment of our modern facebook age of permanent reminders.
In the view of the French, it looks like somebody's got dark.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked very well - not only by the absurd humor (e.g. the story of the speaker of the green, H. Jon Benjamin).
The automobiles declined from the main amazing points - the median age heroes who played along with their children - and they couldn't be able to be disappointed from the previous events.
Prosecution "Ten Years Later" in which adults play not so much on the emotional round and satira are locations until sporadic, including parodies on thrilleries from 90 years as "Carl on the rock".
At one moment, the position is found on the top of Apple Powerbook, Colling Brussels, and “the rest of other things from 1991”.
Many main story lines are repeated.
Coop (Mr. Showalter), now writer, has not been driving through his love to Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panic.
It's not about the crazy plot, which includes Ronald Reagana (the same Mr. Showalter), who is attached to George H. W. Bush (the very well contained by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best parts of the French are much closer story.
Especially happy is to follow the young Rudda with the long hairs of Alis, Matthew Dillon from a young movie, whose respective status of Andy is now for an old paprice.
François could start the moments of adequate disaster, as needs to return the series "Seven Up", until I think it will be logical discovery: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", when the whole group is delivered to the Premier "The Year to Disagreement".
“Comrade Detective” in Amazon, between it applies to another type of nattalicity: revivalism of the normal American Serial War, the film “Atomic Blonde: Unfortunately” and even the series “GLOW” in which the icons of east and west western westling scene are built.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhyse Thomas's office have been a TV inspection: drama of two bukuretic polices from Romania in the 80th century, who fight for the truth and attheism in the way marxism-leninism.
The main role - the amazing Gregor and idealist Josefa - play Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, who set up in the English Channing Tatum (the professional producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
It's crazy, but it's not much more.
In some shoes, you are amazing (come a police monitoring shoes in TV - parodies on American football).
The series has pronounced his voice of many known heroes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Obfferman, Mahershal Ali and Chloé Sevigny.
“Comrade Detective”, but too much focuses on the unseen propaganist drama - which includes and killer with the Reagan mass - and it seems like that.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedial moments are not enough.
In shorter steps, the propagandist satellite could work in the "Comrade detective" as in the scene when Gregor and Josef reviewed the United States, in which nearly two twice-twitters stick hamburgers on a large groom.
The clear message for immature communist obsession is that the western culture can change everything in the wedding and orgy.
The ideas of the Roman creators were not: we do so with our own culture, as well as with them.
Russian atleta was not expected to interrupt the IAAF command.
The International Atletic Federation of IAAF on the Congress in London confirmed the length of the international mandate of Russ Leaders for the State supported doping programme.
The voting in the history of the world championate, which begins at the fifth, has been very uniformly expected.
For the longing of the command, 166 delegates were spoken, only 21 voices were against them.
The main reason of refusing is the fact that Russia is not able to fulfil all the requirements for the implementation of the antidoping system, as constated before the Congress Board of the Special Research Group of IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended to continue the mandate.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspicious atleta has not yet been listed, and in the country trainers are still working with an emotional report.
The full functional advance is not even the Russian Antidoping Agency RUSADA, which does not implement the standards of the World Antidoping Agency.
RUSADA, however, can be carried out under the supervision of foreign experts and the British antidoping agents.

The Bank of England is low to 0,25 %
The Bank of England should notify that the rate rates are not changed by following the unreasonable economic growth and the smoking inflation that has contributed to specialization on a significant growth.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth remains “in the background” in accordance with the maintenance of the rate rate, including the requirements of family budgets.
The political committees for the variation policy (MPC) Banks voted six to two in order to maintain amounts of 0,25 %. The voting results for the increase of the rate are supported by the sustained economic growth.
In its annual report on the inflation of the bank predicted to 1,7 % in 2017 and 1,6 % in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue. The Bank expects that inflation grows at 3 %.
The Bank also stated that in the next few years, it should be grown into the result of the inflation made by Brexit and also showed that the most favorite of the mobility should be increased on financial markets more than they expected.
The Member States also voted to the loading part of the math package which was to support the economy and which was brought to Prax for year as a response to Brexit.
Following the above, it should be started to pay the territory funding plan, which offers a lot of demand to banks, although Bank Anglia has not been granted that the contrary of 115 billion £ is now offered to be less than 15 billion £.
The bank decided: “PC prevents that the severe home product (HDP) will be established in short consideration with a pressure on the real home accommodation and consumption.”
On the basis of the bank satellite, it was necessary to “avoid money policy” to calm inflation, and it was“in higher” than markets expected.
The thresholds currently prevent the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and another growth in 2020.
However, the Bank reveals that any growth will be “restricted” and“limited”.
The Bank has reduced the increase for air and next year in comparison with 1,9 % and 1,7 % in May.
The proposed growth in 2018 was not changed by 1,8 %.
After the publication of the debts, the library cut off the dollar and the euro.
Library claims 0,5 % of $1,31 to $0,4 % at $1,11.
The decision on the conservation of the stage has arrived after the claiming growth of the hope to the next growth, the HDP has stopped 0,3 % in the second quarter of 0,2% of the previous three months.
The amount of great probability remains at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although to the end of the year, banks should be exceededly increased.
The most recent report on inflation is an incompatible effort for households involving inflations and misfortune increased payments, and the Bank stated that situations were still worse before growth.
The report further indicates that the money policy can't “avoid” reduction of advantages in the nearest years, but it is expected that it will “explicitly apply” to the end of three years of prognoses.
Economies should also increase by the great interest of the British resources, which compensates a lower percentage of consumptive expenditure.
This Decision came a year after the last year of August was reduced to 0,025 % in response to the exciting vote on the EU reference, which has been attached to the pool of the library.
The Bank describes that the full-cohesion prices and economy are at least four years.
Before the bank decisions on the most recent samples, many required a growth of sazeb together with a growing inflation that increased a larger pressure on home, and three political actions required in June increase to 0.5 %.
Inflation returned to 2,6% of June 2,9%, although the bank had not been expected to have such changes, and in the next month the inflation should be restored.
The Bank stated that the transversion related to 2 % of the objective was “excellent” in the consequence of low libraries.
Andrew Montlake, Director Coreco Mortgage Brokers, reported: “Because the recent fall of swap sazebs, it seems that competition on the hypothesis market will only be raised when the trusters begin to support laws with a good view to the end of the year.
Thrh seems particularly good for those who end existing agreements and repeated hypotheses - in the offers are options without cutting, as well as low samples that get on the face."
NHS preliminary control HIV 10 000 patients
The patients have access to the ‘transformation’ treatment to prevent HIV on the basis of the Supreme Court of Finance of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis pile (PREP), which is used before sex and reduces the risk of high risk patients to 86%, will be offered through health services at least 10 000 patients in the territory of experience.
The NSH agreed to finance the test period after the Court of Revocation supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the Financial Year with the statement that NHS provides financial instruments to the PreEP Agency, with the statement that the medicinal product should finance local authorities.
The decision announced in April, NHS Anglie adopted from the mouth of the general director Simon Stevens as a “great intervention” while the decision was described as a ‘determining time’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be between the first ones who start to accept patients. Other clinicals will be added to October and to April 2018 will be completely implemented in England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce HIV disease risks.
The tests showed that PrEP reduces the risk of HIV transmission between patients who were infected.
PreEP application before sex means that in the body of the patient is sufficient number of specific drugs to prevent infection.
These medicinal products can take each day or at least two hours before sex.
Between tested patients are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics define the potential participants who submit the compliance with testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with partners whose HIV status is not yet controlled with appropriate treatment.
People living and registered in GP in the Great Britain can also log into their local health clinic and focus on potential participation on testing.
The programme will come to payers at 10 million £ and NHS Anglie signed this week the Treaty to distribute medicines after reaching international public laws.
The test periods are proposed to confer clinical evidence and adjustment of the full potential of PrEP, its target, use and implementation in a large way.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be fulfilled and fully experienced increasingly and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another billion in more than thirty years of trying to stop one of the biggest expression of human health."
Deborah Gold's Executive Director of the NAT (National Aids Trust) said: ‘We are witnesses of a decision-making moment in battle against HIV.
If PrEP has been given correctly and patients in the absorption, there will be the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic.
NSH offers from September the patients designed to high risk of HIV-infection, a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and does not depend on the need to discuss partners, which will lead to improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘Priority number one must be quickly set up tests in the whole country; we must ensure his accessibility to each patient.
Now we have the PPE experimental medicine, and we are on a good path to protect more than 100,000 people who are worse risks of HIV loading.'
The Ministry of Health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the PrEP test period is welcomed and long-termly expected changes after months of payment and maintainment from the government.
The evidence indicates how transformed this medicine can be as part of our access to preventing HIV and the end of the transfer of this life that is preventing infections.
The following tests will bring us a step close to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important to start tests first in the entire country and protect such persons that have been established by HIV and that they have completed the HIV extension in the company.'
Life on high grounds: between parent and smart design has changed this small room to Earls Court in a space house
Joanne Leigh, an old banker with your disease, has changed a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to live at Earls Cour.
It is in the first pattern of the wise teas Queen Anne - and it is a view to a modern design that uses the maximum accessible space.
“ I first lived with my ex-man in a lot of biggest house in Knightsbridge fourth, ” Joanne reported.
“ I looked for a better price.
I've hit this room in Earls Court and had the same height.
I just loved him, and that day I've got a kiss on him."
Since that time, there was a lot of 1000 meters of the full renewing.
A single apartment with complicated resolution - to get to the room, you had to go to the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add range spaces and interpath to use a high street.
“ I used a high train, big windows, and a lot of light.
That was my requirements," she said.
For this purpose, Erfana Azadi was employed from a proposal and design study of Duck & Shed with a sister in Notting Hillu and used at least four-minute street to create a house that was not only a project, but also a place for life.
The staff did not obtain such heights to put up two spaces - the call for the architect was to create an intersect that would be going to be closely.
Erfan had to introduce his creative thoughts.
“Ocean construction is totally complicated,” explained.
“We had both spacers to coordinate so that we could go ahead.
It was not only to set a simple platform, but also to build an ocean building so that it was just higher than and under the stream."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two full-determined rooms on himself - and also add to dramaticity.
It looks at the beautiful room of the old changed window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Circadle in gold color, silver lines and back shirt Serge Mouille creates a single style.
The use of the circle plays an important role in dramatic, space and light.
The short travel is covered on both sides and looks so lower.
The kitchen bar seems like a window to another room.
At the entrance doors, boarding spaces are located in the areas of conventions and clusters.
The event of the resident room that proceeds to be achieved explicitly larger space is the possibility to separate it from the cook if it is not used.
The cocktails are nothing new.
However, what is an unique to this solution, they are a locked door.
“ We had to resolve a technical page, ” says Erfan about the exploited doors.
“The doors are attached to the contradictions to be very easy."
Thanks to the intellectual use of space and store spaces, Joanne received more than 16 meters of fourth, second room and better entire apartment.
“When it comes to this, what you sell is the entire board - or the appreciation of your mate,” said Erfan.
“The reality makle in the base of the income in the apartment shall calculate its price on the basis of the entire desktops.”
In this case, the residual area has been made to increase in the maintenance of quality materials that proceed to the space of luxury view.
“ The material is very important because you take care of it and create an emotional lot with the house," added Erfan.
“ You don’t love electricity disorders in the walls.
Yeah, they're important, but your heart doesn't get up."
As shown, quality design and increase of the residual space can change the normal residence to exclusive work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States are starting.
Cultural and political space between the blue and red states is deployed.
California announced the command of traveling his citizens to Tennessee and other seven States.
The state of Tennessee raised it to her and published the rejected command of traveling his citizens to California.
Of course, the command of the full meaning, the U.S. residents can walk freely through all 50 States.
It is one of that California ordered to put the State money on the paths of her citizens to the eight other countries who are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop it?
California is strong for LGBT and any incompatibility with the LGBT living style considers discrimination.
However, Tennessee adopted the law on the expenditure of the consciousness, in accordance with the psichoterapeut, which has a moral problem with patients with the LGBT community, has no obligation to provide it, but he has the obligation to those patients to ensure another therapy that does not have such problems.
The Texas and the other States adopted the laws, in accordance with which the religious charitary organization from the mother received children after the birth of the adoption, have no obligation to these children to provide the same partners.
According to these laws on the expenditure of the Consciousness of California, its citizens' ways to the eight States of the Union from their means have been financed.
It means that the California professors don't have ways to science symposy, for example, in Texas, their university, because they are co-financial in California.
The school sport teams are usually not able to travel in tours or comforts, for example, to Tennessee with financial support of their schools.
They have to get a federal grant on the streets, but it is absurd that the federal government finance the paths of citizens from State A to State B or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee has received patience and his Parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that he also does not like the California high-date policy, high state expenditures, high deficits and tolerances of illegal immigrants, but it does not affect California because of this route.
It raises them as a review for the California Road Emms in Tennessee.
And the same will be achieved to each State of the Union, which would have established any reason to the other State.
He also invited the Parliaments to stop this disaster.
That's the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is essential, nothing is contrast.
The states have the right to adopt the laws on the expenditure of the consciousness, as well as to decide what their money will go and what they do not have.
Otherwise, what's wrong on the conscience?
If the religious problem is to sell the vessels, why would he not offer only bottles, shoes, shoes and fishing?
Why do you want to sell him under the sanctuary?
In Colorado, one pearl of antidiscrimination challenges and high temptations, because he refused to reject the pit on homosexual wedding.
But it also rejects the pigs to Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't wear him and leave him in the room and the rooms that are appropriate?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federative system is that the fundamental rights of all federative citizens are understood, but the individual States may be able to achieve internal, home policy in the rights that are not federal, to ensure their preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, differences.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
Only California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other States to be also California!
Thirdly, the members of the LGBT communities have ever been able tolerant to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rules of life and let them live to which all understanding people should be guided, but some acticists have no tolerance against themselves and others, except for external nonolerancy against others.
There is no one for them anymore to demonstrate moral, religious or philosophical unrelated with the LGBT Life style, and if it does it, it must be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totally.
They're a new time of enemy freedom.
At the fifth, I don't know the situation in the American history when the states have been adopted for political questions, except for the only case.
Neither in the time of safeguarding for the citizens' rights of black, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and South on the side of the seregation, the states were not holy.
This was the only case of the 19th century, the political case was slavery and was struggled to the North War against South.
Of course there's nothing like this now, but the situation is even toxic.
Cultural and political space between the blue democratic States and the Red Republic States are deployed, and the United States are mainly deployed.
It doesn't allow agitation.
Critic Putina got a massive punk.
The Russian Opposition Policy Alexe Navalnyi received a reward of 300 thousand rubbers to devote the rules of the campaign before the President's elections that are the next year.
The Court has tried him because he called people to participate in unlawful demonstrations.
In the past two months, he organized two major anti-governmental protests and announced that he wanted to take place in March of the next year.
Boss Leader Kremlu Vladimir Putin has not yet published his candidate, but he's totally expected to do that and win again.
Navalnii said the police came to him tomorrow and brought him to the court.
This trial made him because he called people to demonstrate through videos located on the YouTube port.
The trial is three hundred thousand.
"Therefore we shoot them from the jurisdiction," he struck on the twitter criteria Kremlu.
The Russian election Commission has recently concluded that Navalnij could not participate with the President's elections because he was witnessed before.
The jurisdiction that is considered as a fighter against corruption, however, the relevant judgment is considered as political motivated.
The trials in the upper 300 thousand rubbers, at least 25 thousand jurisdiction rubbers in the fourth, also provided two members of the Naval pre-selective team, Leonard Volkov and Nikolaji Ljaskin.
Navalni has entered Russian policy as an anti-corrupt blogger and has progressed on the divorced opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to protect the Naval in the campaign.
It was condemned to the five-year-old crime because of the league of Kirovles.
In May, he confirmed the jurisdiction.
The judgment is so powerful, as the Navale, according to the russical laws, candyding.
Brothers fight about the Imperium for more than 500 million dollars
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the imperial of their Italian family, translated to one of the most recent victorian diseases to over 500 million dollars.
He was Director Carlton Football Club and the developer Colin De Lutis lives on the rule of Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who offered sports on the common room and trade changes to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave a family resident in 2014, but the stress sport was still exposed before the Supreme Court.
With his mother Anna's own brothers, totally 38 diseases in more than half billion dollars. The first business was buying a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
On this place, the family founded Westco Jeans, who grows in a string with 160 stone trades.
In 1999, the family sold the whole company for 85 million dollars.
For money, there were more possibilities and portfolios of the De Lutis family now includes officers, established fields in Brunswick and Sorrent, residents on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and the business center on the subject.
Paul owned nearly one third of the company's activity, while his father Colin, who follows Paul's words, “the higher threat of power and dominant personality” family De Lutis, owned two third activists.
The Court of Justice indicates that Colin's own ability for $316 million, while Paul's ability for $176 million.
Paul's problem was just a distribution of the ability and financial measures.
“Colin's proposal expressed in my eyes in his use,” wrote Paul in a local statement in the court in 2015.
The last fifth, after several unfortunate trials of destruction, the first meeting of the Supreme Court was fulfilled.
Brothers now also support those who will control existing lives - from whom Paul departed according to his explanation of Colin.
Colin replies that it's not true and commits Paul's mistakes with some disabilities.
In the previous location statement, Colin declared that they believe in a conflict solution.
“ My Italian reason shows me that the family is the most important, ” wrote.
The costs of the courts are attached to: hundreds of the sites of local declarations, e-mails and reports from the company, including Deloite, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, pay the lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and the officers of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her married husband Luigi were Italian advisors who carried meat bars and ships from the 50th century and in the 70s they buyed the construction in Brunswick.
For the money achieved by the retained ship was buyed in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with giants.
Colin said that when Westco raised “in the last year of high school, Paul was still small, almost 10 years old boy."
Anna De Lutis showed that with Luigim, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of the mate to children would go well.
“ Luigi often said that he never wanted to end his sons in the court, ” wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are not part of the groups of the De Lutis family. Colin showed that Mark was deleted in his department for $10 million and Luke a total of $26 million.
As Paul said, Luke and Mark were “not satisfied with the conditions of their financial disagreement. ”
Colin takes back from that time, especially the fact that he is an old member of the AFL club's representative, as he made in his autobiography from 2015 Eddie McGuire, known the TV personality and the best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisov and their lawyers at the fifth.
Only Colin answered with the text reports in which he said that, in view of the fact that the sports are resolved before the judge, "I don't have anything to add."
“ It is very suffering that my brother Paul decided to resolve all the matter before the judge, ” wrote.
At the half of 2016, in one of the statements in the Court of Colin, he was trying to apply the requirements of his brother.
“Our father would have been very worried if he had seen our present situation,” he left to hear and added that “he still hoped in a solution.”
On Friday, all the hopes were invisible.
“ Our sports will resolve in a period of judgment, ” wrote Colin.

Trump's new chairman plans to limit the president's medical diet
A lot of people have tried before him, and they've always missed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually prove it.
If so, it's the first thing.
The Portal Politico stated that the new officer in White House plans to limit the information to the president Trumpa - including reporters in television reports - in the hope of keeping the Trumpa on the ground.
This is part of the reporter Joshe Dawsey:
“When the new officer of the white house John F. Kelly was first day in the new worker, he raised the key problem of Trump's White House, which is supposed to edit: wrong information that comes to the President into his hand.
Kelly reported to the employees that you must personally apply all the information - that you already have a paper or a word -- because the President may be better decided on the basis of the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis really means, but many of his primary leaders were in control of Trumpa and his presentation in the mediums were exhausted.
Trump's relationship with the media is given for several decades back - and now when he sits in the White House, his sound is still stronger to watch television reports.
“When Trump was as a candidate of honourable reports, it was appropriate to show him that in the positive light he talked about many other media that had been easier to convince, ” he reported in the office for the police of Sam Nunberg, an old campaign.
Tara Palmeri from the Political Portal once writed that “the key to keep the Trump's twitters on the late - at least according to the word of six older organizators of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly follows the media that are praising him."
Okay.
However, the thought that Trump’s tendency to publish his opinions on Twitter was “sub control, ” is funny.
Perhaps these organizators know something that others don't know - that the Trumpet twitters would be more amazing if someone doesn't control them.
We don't know about the twitters that Trump never sent, with great probability.
If his employees were able to keep him at least a few times on the ground, they did not have their ability to go out.
However, no one has yet been able to violate the Trumpets in order to ensure the contrary theme.
The part of this problem believes that in the White House, who sits with support fractions, people are regularly trying to send their agency because the Trumpets make materials - which they can, but they don't have to be compatible with - that they support their views on the world.
Political portal, which has reached a problem from all parties, published the report on the board of advisers to provide several information on the head of the State.
This is the example of such information from the money of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“The current and ancient officer of the Trumpa states that the President often reacts very excitingly to negative media reports, especially on information reports and encourages their origin.
To this situation, the end of February, when someone submitted the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the websites of the manufacturer Charles C. Johnson - who accused the chairman of Katie Walsho by being ‘the source of a lot of information from the White House.
Unbelieving that Johnson was always made out of Twitter for disagreement, because his suggestion was not made any evidence, because he had already published false accusations in the past and later called them.
Trump read a article and began to ask Walsho's question."
Goldmacher added that afterwards the officer of Reince Priebus and the secretary of the White House Rob Porter “see to implement the system for the test and documentation of information that the President Trump has received”.
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later trying to make the same strategy.
It must be shown that it's more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impressions are not just lost and his assistants still support.
These unchanged factors of Kelly's mission are sure very difficult.
Turists are declared about the ship and return to the 'Millionary Fourth'
Many of the most mobile home owners in the English City of West Midland are replaced again with the decision-making tourists who are eligible with local offices on the right to reach the field for their seats.

The last night they got another, and it's probably more than today."
He added : ‘Birminghams Administrative Council knows how to set up this problem, and he uses court commands to protect the parks.
I live at the Streetsbrook and I don't have to play the money until the administrative advice with tourists is incompatible.'
Anonim citizens said: ‘ It's funny, we've seen recently the last tourists going, and now they're back.
And this time they're more, and this time they've brought the horse with themselves."
The Printing Management Council of the city of Solihull said: ‘We know the unrighteous residence on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police, we undertake the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to meet the most evidence, it is necessary that the most local citizens may notify any non-country or contrary training of the police number 101.
We'll get the whole image that we're going to make in the court.'

Italians in fight against NGO's safe ships with imigrants on the ground
Italy noted that the limits of the NGO's ships to be attached to the borders of Italy with the immigrants from the Central Sea if NGO does not support new rules of regulating their operation.

“For us, it will always be the priority of one human life safe, and so we are very sorry that we can't operate in safe zones in the present time,” said the organization in the statement on social networks.
"All momental offences we can comment only after all information and evaluation of the situation."
The Italian authorities followed the ship of Jugend Rettet from October.
Her ship is surprised that she carried into the ship the imigrants who had directly brought to them businessmen with people, and it was repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the writer of the officer, only 1,3 miles from the border of Libye. The conference procedure was published by the Italian media.
The ship ship is surprised that she has disappeared the law and has obtained a Italian security guard in this area - from humanitarian supervision, less than anything else.
The Codex Management sets the presence of the Italian police agent on the ship board, such as Iventa is to monitor the active monitoring.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in safe operations were yet agreed to maintain the codex: Save The Children, Malts MOAS and Spanish Pro-Action Open Arms.
The latest named organization in the fourth century stated that new rules are not necessary, but acceptable because they do not provide any “recent change or transmission” of saved operations.
The adoption of a new treatment code was rejected, for example, the Organisation of Medicines without border (MSF), which is the holder of Nobel's price.
Minites, between the time, heard that the pregnancy of immigrants in the past weeks that are referred to in Italy in the framework of safe operations, indicates that it is able to send watches to the border of Libye and cooperation with local olders.
“In the last days, we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He also declined plans for further action, which have been achieved in this month with the elders of Libya on economic development initiatives, such as Chadu, Niger and Mali, on the basis of measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achievement of Europe.
Unbelievable Messarosh: He cut her silk and celllide out of the ground!
The horse plane days are completely nice to take on themselves only the most necessary thing that covers the most intimate parts.
It's just Dominica Messosh's doing it once.
At the afternoon meeting in the wild zoo, where the herds, moderators, songs, and all they have to do with the Prima TV, just heavily, his body rolled into the mini overall.
And there was just a few normal moves and a model showed all his silence, but also a dream.
He was over her for many times in the middle of the half, and she was so high that she had to edit him.
At the attention of the masters and the present photographers, they had no reason.
Michelle Carter has been sent by sending text reports to self-mord Conrada Roye
A woman from Massachusets was sent to take freedom for two years to offer his friend to kill himself through text reports and phone talks.
Two-year-old Michelle Carter is seen 15 months from two-year-year challenges and then takes five years in a conditional release.
Carter was condemned in June for an insensitive killing Conrada Roye, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father in the fourth of the court stated: “The whole family is deceived.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left for freedom until the decision was decided.
She was threatened to 20 years of freedom, however, her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered a mental disease.
The Carter stood in the red cups and smokes, when speaking the judgment on the place with slides in the eyes, rolled hands and eyes directed to the ground.
“ Her convention was killed Conrada Roye, ” said the judge of the lawyer.
“ She finished his life for herself.
She couldn't accept its own responsibility," she said.
“It hasn't shown any exchanges.”
However, Carter’s director said that it was “the unfortunate circumstances that are unbelievable. ”
The judge Lawrence Moniz added that “theirs are aged or a level of exceedingness, or even the spirit distress does not have a significant impact on her conduct. ”
She read the statement of Royo’s mother Lynn Roy: “I will not offer the only day that I will not throw up my son’s loss.
I want him to be honourable to me - I'm going to think about his sister, and we're going to smile the unclean pain we're going to get with us forever," remained in the statement.
Royo's sister Camdyn Roy proved that she “seeks ” knows that no party brothers of the Holidays are never part of her children.
“ The loss of the man I saw from my birth is the pain that I will take to life, ” she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to encourage a person who helps himself to kill another person.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the automobile seat, explored by the oxyd.
The case has been taken attention to the whole nation after the published text reports of Carter, who had committed themselves to murder.
“I need a weight, a shoe from the building or a shoe, it is one of me," wrote in the text messages that Carter sent only two weeks before his death when Roy was allowed to be family.
A few minutes before murdering him wrote: "You have to do this Conrade" and "Starts only to get the generator and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter used attention through Royo's death and ordered to maintain any comments in the press.
The case called a lot of questions.
One of the people standing on Carter was Amanda Knox, who was condemned for murder of his British partners in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the accusation was committed.
Mrs. Knox (30) published a statement in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter serves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi edits up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in reaction on the island
The day before the Audi manufacturer BMW announced that it offers its clients to update the software in over 350 000 vehicles.
The President of BMW said that the company believes that there are more intelligent opportunities than guideline restrictions in response to the European city, including Mnichova, which is the BMW seat, which considers the command or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced three million Mercedes cars throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the company called this Decision as a loading.
The European car producers propagated a large measure of use of diesel athobils in Europe and the United States to fulfil the Regulation on HIV emissions.
However, carcinogen is considered and can cause astma.
Furthermore, the automobil costs are higher than the installation of equipment for neutralization of plots from the daily motors, which increases the competitive capacity of vehicles.
While German manufacturers are steadfastly watching, the officer Angela Merkel's accusation of deploying powerful cars companys and ignoring their problems.
The communities are trying to exit Volkswagen' errors, which were able to fulfil the emission limits in their software cars, which reduced the number of emissions provided during the testing, but for regular conditions, the software was disabled.
Some higher representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of Atlantic.
The last month in Germany would be arrested by the old leading termodynamics of the distribution of motors in Audi.
The manager Zaccheo Giovanni Memio is an Italian nationality and does not apply to him, so he can achieve a court process in the United States.
At the beginning of the aeroplane, Audi was introduced to a criminal investigation of the German police in the automobiles of Volkswagen after the Audi had convinced from the installation of the European emiss limits - and extended such accusation in the United States.
Audi cars to investigation may have a poor impact on Volkswagen: Luxury manufacturer creates an immediate part of Volkswagen.
The aircraft was on the board.
The man and the girl died.
There was an accident on the street of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 miles from the south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses of the TV channel SIC Newcias said that the aircraft was steadfast over people who were on the board.
Some people from the boat fled fully before the danger to the sea.
Two people were disappeared before the machine wasn't able to escape.
On the floor according to local media, a 50-year-old man and eight-year-old girl died.
"The aircraft was struck, and in the place they were dead," wrote the local police boss Peter Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people at the airport, both of the diseases brought them alive and police officers brought them to the audiences.
D11, or how he's able to steal.
And are the towns in the Czech?
I'll give you a conviction.
It's unreasonable, even when it started in 1978.
Although it's unnecessary, it's not yet changed.
And it can't still be able to make it, even if it has a stabil authorisation.
What's that?
Yes, the D11-shirt D-11.
The stage of its second stage at least for several months of new months has stopped the child of the earth.
We're driving balls after the woods, like when they're walking in the rooms.
They're hiding the ball, and then they'll see when and if we get another.
We don't want any surprise.
We just want to lose the travel time and we want to get stones to Poland or Poland from the woods and towns.
Infinite stones are directly traveled through the city of Jaroměr or Naked, which is not like a wise object.
Only the last assessment of our exposed deals was made in 2008, so before 9 years of incredible.
Since that time, there's no ticket.
Thus, when the rest of four kilometres were recently started to establish the rest of the King's King's Royal Rainsford and on the other areas to the Year began with an archeological investigation with the end of the year, you could hear the voice of strengthening sports in East China.
Nobody believed that.
The last week was shown that it wasn't going to be a year.
And maybe not the next year.
Children's earth-Club for maintainable transport from Brna was also raised.
The children of the earth repeat their tactics from D1.
The decision on establishing authorisation has been adopted in the entire area.
It is required to review all already expressed statements of all relevant authorities.
For example, the strict governance, the Environment Minister, but also the Ministry of Protection or the Office of the Office.
So then, we're going to eat from D11, not far from the ice with the name of the Provider.
Then let's eat, we'll just go down and stay on the next street, and we're going to give the priority to get back into the column.
The worst is that you see the same story throughout the Republic.
Thank you, unfortunately inspired path to Benesov, D1 or D8.
Everybody has his sepulchre.
What do the Children of the Earth require?
What is the basic basis of communicating issues in Czech?
And why is it practically incomplete in the permanent periodic system?

Levandule from Provence enhances climate changes
Levandule was a symbol of Provence in the South-East France, but now the climate change has been threatened.
The levandule is sitting in the consequences of the smoke and the smooth mixture, which chooses gratitude on the faces of researchers and farmers who look for solution.
Eric Chaisse, Agricultural Research Research CRIEPAM in Provence, reported: “Levandue in Provence is threatened because in the last few years this growth has been established by the changes of climates that have led to the egg and on the ground.
This affects the life of the levandue.
They also have tickets and cups of micro-battery that are given in the soil."
There's a lot in the boat.
Levandule loves tourists and oil that produces from them is an important folder of parfums and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The lower and beautiful flowers are small, increasing, and often weak growth lines.
The number of oils from these leverdues is obviously less."
Possible solution may be more effective distribution of waters and disappearing waters from the floor, but also the driving of the protein of food and water, and the training of more types of different from the sugar.
The fault of newspapers ensures growing graves in Mexico
The employees of the week of Riodoce are regularly in order to discuss the news about the diseases in the area of Sinaloa for participation of organizated criminals, corrupted officers and disturbing drug wars.
However, today, under the report of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They realize that it's important to change their normality.
Two newspapers are talking about what would be safe: to take their children together to the office where somebody was in 2009 cutting a granate or to leave them home.
The officers wrote on the black table three simple words: anti-contractors, neutrals and connections.
The newspapers are requested to introduce a name for each word - no evidence needs, it is sufficient to use presence and prevention.
To choose it from what - tradeholders with drugs, policies, businessers and newspapers are understood that they will take money from government or drug carts - the directory of criminals who are a criminal action.
The nasiles are not stealed and the body is over the crowd, for the whole country; the newspapers are still in place: under the Committee on the Protection of newspapers, they are at least 25 from the presidency of President Enrique Pena Neta to the power in 2012; 589 newspapers are under federal protection on attacks and graves; and in all seven countries they were killed seven years.
In the middle of these also, the periodic co-contributor of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for college, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“ The biggest error is to live in Mexico and work as newspapers, ” wrote Valdez in one of his many books about violence that are driving with drugs.
His loss is quoted, even though his presentness is all-progressive - a great photo of Valdez with a letter “It's righteousness” on which the mediator shows the ground of the building; two newspapers - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - for over 30 years, they have a trick with the photograph of Valdez with a smiling on the face, brave on the nose and the pitching Panama.
The meeting ends in past two months after his death; the newspapers are talking about traumates, night smokes, disappointment and paranoia.
Although in 2010, the special federal procurement was made to resolve the cases of newspapers, the Committee on the Protection of News has still requested two subsequents.
Most of the thousands of murders every year are connected to drug trade and organized crime.
The newspapers of Riodoce continue to be informed of the violence that happens in Sinaloe; although they are the destruction of an accident and the fields of this field are in the present very conscious.
Without information about ransoms and non-visibleness of justice, Ibarra is a meeting of security unreasonable, says Ibarra.
“It's amazing to take time for such meetings,” adds to it.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On May 15, Valdez left the center of Riodoce in Culiacán, the main city of Sinaloy.
He had been able to shoot a few blocks when his Red Toyota Corolla was stopped to two men who took him out of the car and killed him 12 shots, according to the name of the article, which could be translated as the Twelve River.
The shoes then fell into his car, and it wasn't far from the place of the business.
Valdez died in 50 years.
He left his wife and two adult children.
It seems that the news in Culiacan are quickly wide.
But in the case of Valdes, there's a suspicious silence.
Sinaloa was one of the most bloody wars of the country as the supporting fractions tried to fill an empty place from Guzman's lone arrests.
Every day, in the streets of Sinaloi, many people are killed and the gravet is full of the surfaced two-pattern mausoleas for drug kings, many of which are greater than houses.
Remember at the moment that the word “agreement” is considered that one drug cart controls the border with dramatic equipment and the important transports that are put into the United States.
Instead, as the fact that Valdez was confidently recognized with his risks, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-director and the Director Riodoce continues to decline from that he didn't save his friend.
They believe he's got two surprises to his death.
First was the feast of conversation with Damaso Lopezem, leader of one of the drug carts that led the war with the sons of Joaquin Guzman.
The smoke could spread children; the subsequent members of the gang were buying all copies of news at the time they arrived on the pockets.
The second error was not to accept Valdez to leave the land because of its own safety after the news in which the same story was retrieved.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and a border and his death was considered as an important billion in the battle of Mexico crimes against newspapers.
His friends and colleagues believed that it never changed.
In the Northest period, he was practically veteran when he decided to sell his action in 2003 $50 and put together with five colleagues of Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, “the newspaper could not be able to carry out and then not mention drug trade, ” said Bojorquez.
The Riodoce has received the good news for a firm and true report; the news began to give it.
The newspapers liked to pass to the problem theme and publish texts without price - readers fascinated to read his story that nobody else had been able to publish.
Eight years after the accommodation, Riodoce won the prestigious appreciation of Mary Moors Cabot for the report of Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the estimation of the International Freedom of Printing Committee for the Protection of newspapers for its staff report on the Mexico Trade with Drugs.
Valdez openly recognized that he was afraid.
“ I was afraid of my life, ” he said when he accepted the price.
Drugs in Sinaloae is “the life resources,” said Valdez in October of the long year in the conversation for Rompewinto TV.
“ You need to take the role of newspapers, or to play a fool.
I don't want someone to ask me, "What did you do the face of death... Why didn't you say what's going on?"
The Riodoce's employees were steady after Valdezo, a man was known by his funny and unselected tongue, and he was a good friend who liked the advice and objects - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everybody's on his everyday rutin.
He's always taking his kitchen.
He often went to the bar of El Guayabo against the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're going to ask: Have this round of his death?
His death in them also called questions about its own provisions - how to do what is best and remain alive?
"They do not like when you agree with their wives, children, pure business, secretly accessible tables."
“These things were prohibited,” said Bojorquez.
In this regard, the high level of self-concentration and self-concentration is high.
You have to believe your instincts.
If you feel something doesn't play here, hands go away.
The editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "It's the meaning that can be able to steal... and then it came to the thing with Javier."
The old rules according to him, as in the other, in Sinaloae, are not paid - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States, which are the home of the toxic mixture of lucrative pastures, the weak governments and the corrupted policies.
The country's still changed.
In the room where the employee Riodoce is located, no mobile phones are allowed; there were some days ago discovered spyware who buyed governments to monitor Mexico newspapers and activists.
Before the construction of two police officers, there are four hundred grades in the dark tree.
They were choiced by the State to protect the officers Riodoce, which are located in the four-shirt buildings in the Culiacan quarter.
The newspapers are disappeared if these polices are not equal to 50% of the law ' s protectionists who are under the explanation of the competition governments.
It's already a few months, which recently the newspapers have delivered into the front areas that are based on drug carts.
Three main story are on this week program.
The first of them is the murderer of the old boxer Julio Cesara Chaveze in Sinaloe.
They also have increased in the suspicious government costs that have been carried out in the family city of the State government.
Recently, there were several contributions in one of the most luxury restaurants of Culiacán, only blocks from the officer of the State Manager.
Officially, no one has not announced the identity of people or circumstances, so the newspapers had been taken into account when they had been able to write about what every citizen of the city knows: that she is a favorite restaurant of businesses with drugs and policies.
One of the newspapers reported that this restaurant was registered under the name of a certain policy, which is member of the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which controls all the levels of the political scene at least the past century.
Some PRI governments were recently accused of corruption on high beds.
Villarreal requested newspapers to write about the previous incidents in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman is the uniform army unit.
More than a month ago, the readers would read about this theme in Valdes' rubrice, which was the best source of information about the information.
“Valdez would certainly resolve the case,” said Villarreal (46), which is considered "El Flaco" for his shipping position.
"Now all the informors turned back to us."
Valdezo's office was changed to the box of cedule and the pressure to protests against killing newspapers. The employees were sure not expected that they were active in the pressure.
The newspaper Miriam Ramirez has fallen a number of citizens, and on the next morning he has been demoted to the State Leader's office for the next newspaper.
Salvador Adam was lost only three days after Valdez's murder in the west part of Michoacan State.
The Agency says that DNA analysis is about Adame.
Activity of newspapers is running throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and watch on travelers and builders "SOS press".
The New Bojorquez Director is a day to visit Washington, where he is trying to get international support and get justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloy, whose day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez denied the offices of the audience of newspapers and their murders for the reporting of the truth.
At least she asked to transmit to another separation from fear that her wrath might cause her mistakes.
Valdez repeatedly pointed out that the Mexico newspapers are “restricted” by organized crime, corrupted officers, and the low publicity.
In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that newspapers die not only by the hands of drug carts, but also for the participation of policies and security forces that cooperate with the organizated crime.
The Medical Surveillance Group of Article 19 committed more than half of all attacks on police newspapers and public functioners.
"In Mexico you will die because they want you to smile," adds Ramirez.
The crimes are obviously working.
Nobody will forget the death of the bloggers of Mary Elizabeth Macia, which has come six years ago at the north border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with the report that described the Zetas card: "So I have finished for my reports."
A keyboard and a listen locked on the head.
Some citizens decided to finish the activities such as the News of El North with a sister at the north border of Chihuahua in response to the march murder of Miroslavy Breach.
Others continue, as did El Manana of New Laredo after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diary de Ciudad Juarez published publicly drug carts on the official side with the name "What do you want from us?"
Some newspapers have gone out of their homes or even over the border.
It's not easy to decide.
Find the work in the disaster is difficult, as a result of the feeling that nobody continues to follow you.
And the newspapers are persecuted and killed, for example, in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in Mexico City, three months after escape from Veracruze.
For those who decided to stay and don't get their job, it represents a big risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a bunch, admits that he's writeing about drugs.
“Mexican is in hell, so I became a newspaper, ” he said.
It's a fifth north and the Riodoce employer sits on the office office - the newspaper is sent to the printer - drinking bird when he starts to call the phone.
They realize that 19 people were dead at the training between the gang and the police members near the platform restaurant in Mazaran.
The war is declined, just as it promised many references left in this area of syndicate members.
The newspapers publish from the mobile phone on Riodoce websites.
No one day and office titles will change again.
The sounds of the police Siren are shown at another shooter.
Bojorquez's flying look at the police spectacle to convince if they're looking forward.
If they're afraid, they don't give it any point.
Under the severe portrait of the field partners of their period, the mediator is an interpreter for the whole Sinaloe - all employees of Riodoce follow his steps.
"How could we just think about the department," said Bojorquez, "and when I was killing Javier, one internist asked me to send her to the street?"
The Dinosauers used the chambers to escape the enemies
On the first look, it looks like a shoe, as it's scared.
The researchers have now declined the conclusions of the first creation of a wonderful creation on the size of the north, which has completely maintained the rests - whose experts called Mona Lisa dinosaurs - found a Canadian horn.
The rests were achieved in such a high way that the experts could determine the color of his slipped hair and show that the dinosaurus had a "probable age".
The article in the journal Current Biology stated that it was ‘the most maintained achieved dynamism and one of the best species of dinosure in the world’s world.’
The rock is a new kind of family of Nodosauridae. Dinosurus lived in the Crisis period, probably 110 to 112 million years ago.
His fully maintained status was explored by researchers who described it with the word 'the spectacular'.
The larger branch is, according to National Geographic, the best story of his type.
In the field, Shawn Funk, who held the stone on 21 March 2011 when the bottom of Suncor Milenium was near Canadian Albert.
He wrote something that looked like a stranger subject and decided to look at her near.
The stone was sent to Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have launched the following six years of work for the discovery of animals from a large coast of 1100 kg.
After the end of work, the dinosaurus is ready to get away.
Caleb Brown's leader's work and the Native Museo Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the beast is designed.
"It's probably written in the history of the history as one of the most beautiful and best species of dinosaura - Mona Lisa dinosaurs."
By the study of his hair, the researchers found that this bubble rave - although he was hidden by the smoking and reminded the driving tank - with a great probability he had a serious threat from the sides of massive dinosaurs.
In the same way, the broken dinosaurus used the red and white cup to protect the predators and used the mask system that uses many animals today.
The scientists say that it has been allowed him to split up with their areas and get out of the enemies. The system maskment indicates that he was a favorite food of greater dinosaurs.
Reports about 110 million years of old dinosure family Nodosauridae were first discovered in the news in May. Currently it is available to visit Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The investigators gave him the name of Borealopelt Markmitchelli after the technology of Mark Mitchell, who held more than 7000 hours of the fossyl discovery.
Thanks to the wonderful stage of fossility, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the models and the shape of sprinkling and burning throughout the whole body.
They disappeared the method of masking which they usually use animals today to protect - the top part of the animals was darker than his low part.
Although this massive effect is normal, the detection of researchers is surprised because the size of Borealopelta is exceeding the animals that use the same technology today.
It is therefore possible that dinosaurus was such a quantity of predators that evolution gave to survive the prevention of masking before confrontation.
Many current animals with masking - example of yellow, assembly and or passive - are too less and more rare than the use which indicates that neodaurus had to fight about his surviving enough.
“The predace of a serious and hard dinosure of the dinosure is considered the dangers that represented predators in the crisis period,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the shops also discovered that the dinosaures had most likely red-rounded colours.
The researchers continue in the study of animals and passengers after other knowledge of his life, including the maintained content of the prison to eat his last food.
They believe that the dinosaurus fell into the river after death and was brought down into the sea where he fell on the day.
In the area of Alberta, there was the same suburbs as in Florida and the rivers and the oceans have passed much further to the inner country before it is today.
‘This nodosaurus is really careful in that it is completely covered in perfectly stored shops and also is stored in three dimensions and so you can see his original size,' said Brown.
‘ For these reasons, the animal seems practically like at the time of the crisis.
For his rebuilding, you don't have to use your presence; it's enough to shut up your eyes and seems like he's sleeping.'
In the period of crisis, the earth passed a large earthquake, massive dinossors who moved on two foots.
Although the king of all the dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus King - lived a few million years after Borealopelta, this delicious dinosaur could be favored by his same threatenous presences.
Acrocanthosaurus, 11,5 metres of long monster with driving over 6 tonnes.
Researchs whose most recent inspection was published in Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelt was paid to the sea after it was mumified in the garden.
Shawn Funk, who held the stone on 21 March 2011 when the Suncor Milenium was low to the Canadian Albert.
According to the museum, it is the best recorded dinosure in the world, including the hair and the smoke, which is more complete from the chain after the cup.
The animal was achieved in a middle of 5 meters and amounted to 1300 kg.
From the branch, he's spent two centimeters of the bottom.
Researchers believe that this branch has broken the country of the Canadian today until he ended in the river that he delivered him into the sea.
His submarine sepulchre kept the body in perfect state.
Fossil rests of this type are also increasing that the flowers around the wood are still spreading the rest of the hair.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of such a recorded one can be compared to the exhaustion of the lottery.
As long as I'm seen him, I'm looking like a shooting naze.
Fossil rests of this type are also increasing that the flowers around the wood are still spreading the rest of the hair.
On his side, his right front foot with the bottoms on the top.
I guess I'm counting the springs on his travel.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, the British Ferrell's shoot over the whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis's family was sitting on the room at Airbnb room and went to Facebook on his phone.
She also wrote an article on a question of a middle school.
“ The police just shot a 18 - year - old young man who is still on the street, ” remained in it.
She appeared that nobody else wrote her this article, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah has recently reviewed her articles on the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published his contributions on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, unarmed of a 18-year-old young man who shot a white shooter in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He published Brown's body's photos, which leads uncontrolledly on the street, from where no one took it even after four hours.
"It's crazy," she thought Ferrell.
But death wasn't for her and her community.
She left the phone to return to him evening when she looked at the twice of people who were gathered together on Canfield Drive.
She seeked the photographs of the police boards and the smoking people. One of the men stated that he was the father of the victim, and in his hand he held cedding with the letter "Ferguson's police killed my unarmed son!"
She had seen living news - one of the police stayed before a group of protestants, guarding in the hands of the water and his second end of the single dog.
In another video he held another police, as she brought, in the hand of the weapons that he had on the dawn and said, "I will kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
"This is not the type of murder that we used and we can be called normal.
I felt smokes around the whole body.
"I was angry and wept."
Itned spoke back years and on the second day she left home.
After accessing at 23:00, she brought her six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they were going to Ferguson morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson during the following three years, the new document “Whose Streets” will be referred to in August 11.
This is a story of survival and protests, love and rebellion, strength and independence of people who live in the community who produce in the street and require answers.
On the path to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with her daughter - clothed in a flower tree and the same flower branches - about the theme that they had already been used for many times - "on the experience with black."
"You remember how I taught you about how the blacks had to fight for what they believed?" she reminds the conversation.
"We're just going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
“ I didn't care that I wouldn't take her with me, ” said Ferrell later.
“ The events today are the explanation... to which the past happened.
She had to know and see his own eyes and grow in it.
She needed to develop not only in the active and organization, but also needed to know the differences between the various levels of experience with black and what we need to do for our freedom.
Although I can ensure her conditions in which it doesn't live on its own racism, it doesn't have any way to be different from another black child.
I feel that if I'd protect her before this experience, I'd just shoot her."
After the arrival to Ferguson, it was the first stair Street South Florian Road against the police division, which became a basic activityist who expected the word of the police Darren Wilson about his random participation in the accident.
Here Ferrell met her daughter with a local businesser who prepared for other food.
They prepared food together to the ships and helped it to develop protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, he started to get a new type of activity.
“My activism turned up on 9 August,” said Ferrell and added that at the high school University of Missouri-St. Louis was the president of the Miniority Student Nurses Asn. and he encouraged her to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“ I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell's demonstration was informed with a later collaborative document, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "doctrine only" the event.
But Ferrello said: "Do you work on the document or are trying to find a story that would use?"
This type of skepticism has entered into the community through many people, often whites who wanted to make pain and decisions.
Folayan explained in an unexpected conversation: "We heard the voices of people who are born and growing in Ferguson are very often forgotten and we wanted to change it."
Folayan has already been invited to cooperate with Damon Davis, who is recognized by a local artist who is in prison in the whole dead.
His participation in the project also invested Ferrello and with other six local citizens who looked at the Whose Streets team in the following years after killing Brown.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but this is our explanation," said Davis.
"This was important for me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the objective of the document was not focused on Ferrell’s interests - in order to show that the vote was “not about the saved leader, but about the communities, ” Flayan’s pointed out that it was just the most open to participate in the filming.
The document "Whose Streets" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she loved her wife.
"I felt as a hair," said Ferrell with a smile on the face when I thought on the first time she looked at the final version of the document.
“But I understood that I could do this work and pull the blacks, I have to open."
Ferrell's advertising includes the role of the middle black woman in the largest aspect of Black Lives Matter.
Two of three challengers - who created in reaction on the killer Trayvona Martin in 2012 in social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves a surprise.
“ The Black Central Women on the leaders in the final result, ” said Ferrell, “the reason that we are still fighting on more fronts.
"The Black Central Women must be able to smooth the pain of these events."
Folayan with this statement agrees and adds that “heating is in fact supported by black women and greatly central black women”.
However, the blood is that "This doesn't use a firm interest" and Ferrell is not the main heritage document because of its opinions.
“ This was just a smoking power and energy source, ” she said.
“ That she just feels in the previous lines is not an agreement because the life on these crowds in the black hair is dangerous.
He had the energy you're feeling too before the screen."
At least, back to Ferguson, the television stations cameras have broken their position, but the hard rasy train between the community and the police survives.
Ferrell rejects two and half an air condition for locking the deal at the demonstrations.
Socially political atmosphere in the area called home, she described as "Orders".
However, he doesn't have the chance that she had been driving for a minute before three years ago to Ferguson Street.
“ It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We have to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our strings."
It's a field on the Colonel.
In the place of the ten of the hazards, he helped the robbery.
Nearby Czech Brod in Colonian, between the cities of Binan and Liblice, the field of 15 hectares came from 14:00.
Fire stopped broadcast around 15:15, the hashiors reported the third grade of the fire of four possible.
According to the speaker of Ladislav Hollywood, the fire from the air washing and the smoker.
In 18:00, the hazards were offered to haasit, the fire caused a challenge for 700000 corners.
With the flowers on the place, the ten professional and welcome challenges were fighting.
The fire has been achieved by the technical difficulty in the combined room.
Hasit also helped the robbery who held six with water.
"Instead of the case, we've given the leader tomorrow at 8:00, he'll watch him one of the favorable hazards," he said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: artificially creates portraits with the ADN Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the New York Fridman Gallery rooms, some faces are located immediately - white, black and dreams - cutting from the street on the roads.
All 30 portraits created the Heather Dewey-Hagborgo's artificial from the outcomes of the mouth dutin and hairs that she sent him Chelsea Manning.
Maning sent his models from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where an ancient analytical rejects 35 years of penalty for unrighteous publication of secret cabels on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition started in August 2 is named A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of the double-year comparison between Dewey-Hagborgo, which combinates its experience with technologies, information and sciences, and Manning - trans-sexual and physophy disident, which has reduced Obama three days before his department with President of the United States.
The Algorithmic Analysis of DNA Maning and using 30 portrats to consider how a man with this genotype, created the Dewey-Hagborgo, not if the intellectual comment on DNA submission - as well as many ways that can interpreter DNA - and the unexpectable determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has already spoken from the young manner that he was considered a woman. It was judged in 2013 on the basis of twenty requests, including the absence of six spione laws, computer supply and crazy.
All of her photos were held by the prisoner. On the public, only one black white photo in the low quality on which Manning, visiblely worried, is sitting on the seat of the manager in the platin floor, which is now connected.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions on the Dewey-Hagborgo project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
In the framework of this project, the Dewey-Hagborgo's various forensic subjects - such as cigarettes and cygarettes - to create images of these people.
And just in this time she received e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“Their interview with Chelsea Manning in prison, and they wanted to fulfil the portrait," explained Dewey-Hagborgo at the opportunity of opening new items.
However, the visits or photographing were not allowed, therefore they returned to Chelsea with a question if she should be interested in DNA portrait.
The artificial and her arrested museum scrambled in two years through the corresponsibility.
They created even comics with the name Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who showed a view of what would happen if Chelsea was disappeared and could participate personally.
President Obama, actually, requested a few days after the complaint for Manning, which was welcomed by a few unexpectable years in the military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting that the expenditure is just at the time Donald Trump leads a war with people who encourage the publication of government information and transgeneral soldiers, while trying to find new ways to support their twins in areas to support.
In response to the question about this special time of Dewey-Hagborgo, the Dewey-Hagborgo stated that "all happens for some reason."
Under the statement of the authority on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls his big signature (i letter in the acceptance is exposed by the heart) after the end of the "composite fractionary based on heads, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, the sequence of her medochondrial DNA is the table of letters C, G and A of the basic.
200 letters (or nucleoids, for the sophistic scientist vocabulary) wanted Dewey-Hagborgo to illustrate how surprised it is, at least after the biological side, we all are.
“I hope that people will be sure that our genoma does not depend on whom we are, and that genetic data are subjective and each can make them up after their own," said Dewey-Hagborgo. It is also the work of Spirus Memories from 2007 on the video.
"ADN reports a lot of different story, this is 30 of them."
The last exemplar of the exemplar located in the apartment is the only page of the above graphical notes.
Shows Manning, which is raised by the way King Conga from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with the Megafon in his hand.
“When you are cutting, they will win, ” wrote in her.
"Don't let you wake up."
“It's a correct replacement from one of the letters,” she reported the philildelphian artificial.
"When I think, he's cutting my cups."
Maning has not personally visited - what was proposed in the comics - but when it happens, it will be approved in the middle of its rooms, with its own genomic similitudes, sorted as the dawn of protestants.
It was also the objective of the exhibition, including at least 160 cm high socks of Maning, on which its genetic haploscupines are described.
“In the past, they were located on the walls, but this time I wanted to make the feeling of the damage, ” said the Dewey-Hagborgo about portraits.
“I wanted to bring a mass move that takes the like Chelsea and frees it."
Professor Northwest University and Oxford Universities are searched for murder
In those days, the entire national guest of the Professor of Northwest University and Oxford University employees who are struggled by a murderer who was found to die in the Luxembourg cities, brought the police.

“In the future, we will end the WADA plan”, the officer of the Russian Government of Mutko
The Chairman of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko urged that it would not be long and to implement the remaining criteria of the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) and the rehabilitation of Russian Antidoping Agency (RUSADA).
“In the present time, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
With regard to this reality, the WADA plan was updated," pointed Mutko on Friday.
The Chairman commented the second part of the WADA plan for the detailing codex, which describes the criteria for renewing RUSADA, which was recently published on web sites.
According to Mutka codex, it doesn't contain anything that Russia should be worried.
“All was announced, and it will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympian Committee (IOC) and WADA in the nearest time," added to it.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls after the public report of the WADA investigation results, which had investigated Richard McLaren, on the indicated sponsor of the Russian Sports of the government.
Muka said: “Let's investigation, because our antidoping system was clearly missing.
It was attached to all measures.
However, there were no State programmes in our country and we can't confess to anything that has never existed."
The Mutch word confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Antidoping Commission.
In the discussion of Russian RSport Smirnov, the Russian Antidoping Affairs had recognised problems, but he added: “We have made many opportunities that the report contains control positions and regulations.
Nobody plans to accept the report completely without expenditure," concluded Smirnov.
WADA submitted RUSADU from the establishment of doping controls in Russland in November 2015 directly before the doping scanner.
However, the Organization allowed the planning and evaluation of testing under the monitoring of international experts and the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD) in June.
After visiting the Moscow Centre, the General Director of the WADA Olivier Niggli stated that the RUSADA was “on the right path” to renew the validity.
The police committed three people, one is younger.
The police has convinced three men from the establishment of a central wooden tree in Thirty-Gutech on the Frydecko Mistress.
One of them is a young man, all three are the Czech Nationality.
For a criminal act of general threat, they're threatened to 15 years of prison.
The newspapers said this today, the police director Thomas Kužel.
He's going to say about an essential crime.
"It's a very pure thing and the police in the present time works on the subject of the whole matter," said Kužel.
He stated that the police would act on the potential to carry out in the vessels.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"I can't share any more, because the workers really work on the crime policy and investigators and the State Manager who observes the matter," said Kužel.
The tree cocktail of God’s body in Gutech from the 16th century.
It was a price memory with a lot of original storage and images from the first half of the 16th century.
The physical disagreements will go according to the preliminary disagreements to ten million corners, but historical loss is innumerable.
The taxes after the fire began to consider the cocktail again.
Most of the costs should be covered, for other costs is prepared to share the Ministry and the town, prepares the public collection and calculates the contribution of the owner of the memories, so the local farnots.
The similar tree coats of Holy Catherine from the 16th century in the Ostrava-Grabs also destroyed the fire of incense for 15 years ago.
She used it once for electrical installation.
Then he took a exact copy on his place.
Stating counts with the companies in the state.
They support their education.
Financial support for companies used to protect the State, with a favourable shooter, or with a team of training schools, the matter of the law on the preparation of citizens to defend the State.
The Ministry of Protection that his processing has been made for a task from the government promises that it is so to increase the physical presence of the Czech and their capacity that could then be used in crisis situations.
It's exhausted from the proposal that the Ministry prepared.
If the law would be adopted in the future, the State would be based on the support of the branch of hundreds of million corners.
The basic objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help the preparation of the citizens of the Czech Republic to protect the State, and to be branch obligations and on the basis of goodwill.
For example, financial or material supports the collections of radiomaters, shooters or cynologists and allows them to increase the capacity of their members.
It would have obtained data on people who are desired to come to the country during the crisis for aid and their capacity or material rescue.
It would also be a creditive instructions that would help partners and other interesters in training or training.
It is also counted to organize nearly with military veterans or people who have held herds.
One of the potential variables suggests that the new office should be taken on the care of administration and coordination of the project.
The automobiles of the proposal are aware that the participation of people should be welcomed and would be used to use their capacity until the statement of a restriction.
"The whole concept must respect the progressive storage of public borders between individual types of graves," shall be considered in the purpose of an indication on the dangers of such hybrid graves.
The Ministry Officers noticed that it is therefore necessary to focus on the support of the most largest capacity, not only those soldiers.
"The basic objective is to create a very wide basis that allows each citizen to react qualifiedly on the situation of the sustainability of the State or Life, Health, Health and Maintainment of persons, to protect themselves, in particular to protect others, and not to ensure the fulfillment of the works of the force of the Czech Republic."
The law's adoption would be brought to a lot of financial proceedings.
Their higher will be in accordance with the Ministry to take into account the selected variable.
For example, the Agency provides a financial support for projects to prepare citizens to protect the State to 100 million corners.
If the administrative and coordination centre was established, its conduct could be at least 60 million corners each year.
Further money would go to pay or build the information system.
The proposal also suggests that the competence of national military governments should be extended by 42 other soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already concluded that the law should also help to resolve non-compliance with the Directive of the European Union on the weapons.
His adoption would allow shoes that will be part of the system to leave some weapons that the directive will lead.
Launchups that your company will help you not stay with the other Uber
Amy Errett wanted to meet the peace of the employees of her e-commerce's startup, but she didn't find a suitable research.
The answers were often unreasonable, unnecessary, or even crazy.
And although she promised anonymity to the investigation, some employees declared their unbelief in the whole process.
“I looked for the consequences and objectives,” led Errett, the e-commerce officer of the hair-commerce company Madison Reed, with a sister in San Francisco, who works for 75 people.
So she's asked for help.
On the market, new startups are found out of the organization of human resources that help the society to investigate the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licence of the software with specific purposes of measurement of employees allow the launchup by the company to carry fast voting, targets to specific teams and demographical groups, and further offers an anonymous employees and a high link to be stealed, and in some cases also allows the informators to be held and to contact the director.
“In the market there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, who monitor your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?", Jim Barnett, the partner and the general director of startup Glint with a seat in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glennt for three years, she's more aware of what her employee thinks and what she feels.
In addition to quick training and the voting of specific teams, glint provides the telephone map of the company and a regular overview of groups with the highest number of steel, as well as managers with low evaluation - which allows users to process.
The Communitys start to know that it is necessary for the employment culture - for the case that it becomes another Uber - which is declined in the scenarios after the ancient employee published on his blog as described by the professional environment and employees who refused to speak openly.
For the startup as Glint, a question on the investigation of the company culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Web pages Let's Talk Payments, which is achieved by technical and financial progress, the value of global control, regulation and compliance to 2020 can move 118,8 billion dollars.
Startup Convercent from Denver in Colorado State, who helps the company in preventing and disappointment of unreasoned behavior, saw a small growth of interest and activities at the beginning of the year before the Uber scandals.
between at least 600 clients of the Convercent is Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also accepted Uber.
As Glint allows the Conversent to send a suitable "block" research, collect confidential information in real time and display the temperature maps of the problems areas.
It also provides an anonymous text to the top line that allows employees to communicate unlikely.
If the General Director is concluded in the problem, the courages are sent directly to the Administrative Council.
“The South Watch of Public Affairs have powerful regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the launcher and the Executive Director of Convercent.
If the company is convinced from wrong conduct with his employees or non-etical conduct - and if the regulatory is not exceedingly, it may be achieved by the cost results of the fighting of advocats, the elimination of employees or judges, he adds Quinlan.
Restaurant Ruby Tuesday, which works over 25,000 people, for example 500 locations, uses Convercent more than a year to increase the understanding of employees on financial principles and procedures and ensure the easy way to contact competition.
First, if the employer wanted to report any problem, he had to look at the phone number or e-mail on the manager of the company, officially to give courage and hope in an appropriate solution.
Sometimes it was about a fearful and unexpected experience, James Vitrano, general manager of Ruby Tuesday, according to which he had not existed a common way of monitoring the employees.
Now, when the company uses Convercent, it is ensure that the rapid detection and the solution of problems that have never been made before to managers sitting in offices, in a mile of the real solution of discrimination, dealing or wrong conduct.
“It's close to the holistical, complete view of the experience of employees,” said Vitrano, which leads to the group of Ruby Tuesday on risk management.
"We also protect operators from the judicial sports from the employees."
The community stopped to take the ethics, values and participation of employees in the low ship in 2002 after the accounting company of Arthur Andersen was exploited after Enron's falling in the use of ethical rights of employees, said Quinlan.
But when the company began to realize that in the online world they could not easily keep their customs in the box.
“Before people started to be used to monitor the technology ethics, they felt in faith,” said Quinlan.
Glint and Conversent offer their software in the form of service for which the company pays the rules.
It is a commercial model and the opportunity to apply the low capital investors supporting both startups.
Convercent chose in the frame of his feast campaign from the company like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for $10 million, and finally took the capital to $47 million.
Glynt received $10 million in November from Besamer Venture Partners and in the whole campaign, $60 million.
These investments are surprised in view of companies, cultures and risk capital.
The various number of researches clearly confirm that employees today wait for their workshop more than ever before.
And on competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, are not the main costs of high and interesting projects.
The employees want to mean that they are accepted and evaluated and that they take their time for the company that encourages the positive message.
“If people are happy in their work, they know that their voice is listed, and that their jobs are respecting, they take for successful companies,” said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employment Committees of LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors are made if companies and companies are exposed if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool is found on the market, which will ensure the employees' responsibility and the obligation of the company, it is not amazing that many investors will be found to support this effort.
According to the experts on the employment culture, it is important to provide data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the same data are unreasonable if the company does not have any necessary steps.
The fact is that when the company requests a revoking from its employees, it may be great changes.
And if the changes are not quick - in the worst case - it can choose the destruction and unemployees.
“When you ask 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversions," said Russell Raath, advisory director in the Cotter International company, who was witnesses of many companies that were too satisfied to the same data.
“ So when you do not get things to the end, the employees begin to ask the question: ‘ Have you heard me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it be interested in me? "
Madison Reed, which now regularly carries the investigation between the employee, will make it possible for Glennt to resolve the problem for one day, brought Errett.
After the meeting of returns from employees who were frustrated by a few decisions and the quality of communication, Errett made her to reorganize several teams in the framework of the company and started the training of communicating to resolve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important view on its employment and hopes that it will be a long view of a high employment in the abortion that is known by a frequency.
“If you don't want to create a transparency of work environment, the employees will not believe you," added Vitrano.
“And when you start to lose the job, you will come to the lawyers.
And with the separation of the lawyers, the whole company is decreasing."
Fourth was the latest day.
Thirdly, 38.3 are noted in the Hodonian Watch Tower, still the latest day of the year in Sweden.
He realized that he was the first day of the year with 37,3 degrees.
They have informed that the Chess hydroteorological establishment workers.
In contrast of the wedding in the fourth, but there were no many temperature records.
The officer's mainly smoothed in Mora, in the Czech was overwhelmed.
It was convinced, or the records were equipped to 35 of 145 meteorological stages measured over 30 years.
On Friday, the record was recorded only for nine long-term measurements.
In the Watch Tower, today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In July on Brussels today 37.4, the original maximum of four decades has been performed and in the Republic of the current 37.1, the record has exceeded to three decades.
Both records have come from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared mostly on the south and east of Moravy.
Following the Watch Tower was the largest officer in the Dictionary of Znohems and Brother Over Day in Brazil, where the rate was fully exhausted at 37,8 degrees, but the record was not fulfilled.
For example, in the West and Northern Czechs, the CHHMU website has still been the highest temperatures of the Celsia only around 22 degrees.
"The teplots started growing up until now afternoon," they shared meteorologists.
The current officer in Czech will proceed on the basis of the CHMU, and in the week, it may also be more explicitly rained.
At the most places of Moravy, the high temperatures remain on the fifth and on the southwest of Morav and on the Sabbath.
We've been talking about this shoe here.
The billioners do not suffice the same voice in choices as every full-year man in the land.
They want to decide directly, and because they are not all so worse as Andrej Babiš who wants to have State, they buy political sides.
Maintainer Penty Marek Getting together with other colleagues behind the water of Martin Burda and Antonio Frič spooks the Reality.
The second life of the Universal Democratic Aliance finances the guarantee of security and business in the realities of Paul Sehnal, who is also the president.
The judicial corruptor and the King of the Czech Hazard Ivo Valent ordered the private side.
Agrofert's political threat, as Andrea Babish project would not want to be called a Christian elder Jaroslav German, is a chapter for himself.
His billioners recently took the Starests too.
It's Dalibor Thanksgiving, officer of Jablotron.
According to his own words, he enters into the policy to conduct good.
He's entered into ancient branch, but he didn't make a lot to the Daddy.
"I never hate small targets," he said to the print conference.
That means that my goal is to steal ANO to get the smoking of Starest in 20% options.
Leckdo's hungry.
Baby's exclamation, but it's almost significant.
The billioner Dalibor Children is a man of certain views.
While it's going to go out of the voice of the pills in the Starest tree, Andrey Babish is still supporting Andrey Babish.
The baby was also supported in the past parliamentary choices.
"Babiš is not a guarded speaker and does not govern a favorite retory of political harvests," wrote about it before the options 2013.
However, he's not in the policy because he wants to cut off personally.
Baby's gonna stay here for me.
It's easy to get out of his world who's under control and do something for all of us.
A short time after the Starests presented her as a new force, he recognized from his view to Babylon again.
And he said that the Starests wanted to learn to be able to imagine the work with Babies.
Some can appreciate that the Children does not have their opinions and stay behind them without regarding what the door is just taking.
Others can speculate whether Babyish sent to the Stars to build his neighborhood as such as a sick.
Next can they ask whether the boss Jablotron must not grow in the worst of the boss Agrofert and does not look for another way to fight his business rival.
The first aunt's public exhibition was not just touched around Babys.
The kid promised Stars to send 10 million corners to the camp.
And if you need more money, you'll have more.
A few years ago, someone would have stopped the same phrase.
Recently, the judicial jurisdiction guarantee Zakenik Bakala was raised millions on all sides before elections in 2010.
The political division of Vita Barty, TOP 09, and civil democracies have come together for 30 million.
It's just another time today.
The law orders any political side to give more than three million.
When the Baby already enters into the policy, he could at least study the game rules.
Maybe he wouldn't have to ask a question why the policy has so bad news with us.
His first days in the policy, then, the Deutsch Corned the proposal for the payment of the family with students of children.
People with high school training will come with us a month to 50 thousand.
They're based on the 20-year-old.
A man with fifty thousand is in the lowest rate of rich.
That with the twenty poor.
In the views of the Audience, the poor society pays courageously and the riches use the costs of the social state's functioning, which are not too shared.
The rich is shortly needed to help them not to be disappointed.
The stars can welcome together with their new activists and Babies to shoot their hands.
We also can confirm that billions are not worthy of people.
Then there's another question to call.
For me those who know the rules of games and want to keep them.
Those who are members and members of their parties, neither residents and residents of the State are not for their employment and land for their own possessions.
And finally those who want to live in the rich land, not only to others.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The wild complex had to lead about 234 million.
You'll sell the possibility sometimes it's not easy.
And sometimes it can't help him even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view on the sea, or the fact that it's impossible to sell the president of the United States Donald Trump.
By selling a vial complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price was gone down for an incredible 8 million books.
He reported this web Mirror.co.uk.
In the brochure, it's about the ground, "Come welcome, Donald J. Trump."
Unnecessary to the place as no other.
Only the connection of real society with the American President has not obtained extreme price.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean Side for an incredible 8 million books.
The original price of disease was 21,5 million liber, the final price of 13 million books.
And then, after the left, the wild complex is like 76 average apartments in the centre of Praha.
And it's not what to be surprised.
The reserved seat of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full-ups, 11 bedrooms, many foods, rooms and other rooms.
It's based on a few buildings.
The part of the ground is also the basen and the tennis cort.
On the ground, the ten of the palms are raised on the ground.
The terrace is a beautiful view on the sea.
According to real experts, the fact that the connection with the President is not sufficient to access potential solds.
Now it's impossible to be near the regular price of inability on the island.
Trump buyed inability in 2013.
According to the speculation, he paid about 15 million books.
It's not possible to buy it for the purposes of the pronounce.

NCAA has decided to conclude two training day. For Bruins, it is a long time for Bruins.
The 11-year-old American photoballs and players of the UCLA University are close to the range of a new school train.
Some of them cover the dress and disappear the rewarded back, an increasing sign of the first day of the treasury.
For the most members of the team, these few minutes of disorder will supply a lunch break.
Players in the air semester will go to rooms after three-hour training to study at final tests before they return to the waterman Football Center to the meeting that comes in the morning at 6:30.
“ For these kids, the next three days will be a stripper, ” said Bruins Jim Mora trainer a minute before the lunch is overflowed in the outer.
The explosion of two training in one day, the NCAA wants to remove the players - paradoxically the training days are still wide - at least to the five when the final tests end.
That's why the first three UCLA treasures are based on 19:15 - to be joined in such a surprised journal.
First of the six seasons that Mora trained on the training position in Westwood, started the Trein Kemp Bruins a week ago before the last year and treining are limited. His influence also has the decision to limit the number of trainers from two to one day.
The total is planned for the eighth training to August 20, which starts formal preparations on the first challenge against Texas A&M, which is finished in September.
Mora left to hear that it supports the NCAA decision, although it has added another item to the already attached player's journal.
“ Three or four days are players under a great stream, and it's very exciting for them," said Mora.
“But no one has made it, they're all trying, they're great.
I think in the Sabbath, when we have more time, it's all quiet."
The UCLA will be closed after the end of the training cheap, which will not be easy to view the clear line of areas from the close park and the Luskin Center Hotel, which contained the players after the branch protection network.
The players of Bruins should contain the hotel at the beginning of this week, but Mora recognizes that when the room is broken during the area, it could be a problem.
“ The field will watch security service, ” added Mora.
“ Security is set, but it is not excluded that someone can take peace and play our treasures.
It's a good business with such materials.
The hotel will be happy to watch the protection, like the parking room 8.
We'll use our means at the maximum.
I believe it's gonna be fine.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans more significant control of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control the third parties and show the survey under the original articles in trying to fight the "fake news" called "fake news", she has introduced the largest social network in the fourth century.
The Community in its report on your websites writes that it will begin to use updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxs, which will send to third parties to verify and to show the results of the research under the original articles.
Facebook was marked as one of the main sources of false reports and many think that these unexpected reports have affected the lonely election of the President of the United States.

It added that the Facebook company continues to test the function “compatible articles” and also works for other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Graphical news creation: History of A Castle in England
The small gate Scotney Castle recently played the main role in the Squeeze group's musical video clip in the 70th and 80th century.
Scotney, however, was from his exciting location at the River Bewl in the British Kent, a 700-year-year-old story story inspired by James Rhodes from the York City - a known consent in historical documents - to create graphical notes.
“ Look at the letter of a person who's 300 years after death fascinates me, ” says Rhodes with a serious face.
"If I keep a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphical newspaper A Castle in England documents the life of a family who lived on the game of Scotney from the middle-year to the Eduard. Every story is an illustration of a different British friend - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smithova, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first inspired archive of Rhodes: it is also author Dead Men's Teeth and other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired British book documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
“ He carried me on a letter that wrote a double agent in the 70s, who worked for Jacobity, ” said.
“ It's a pressure of his hands!
And the letters are always driving as a bullshit, because in those times you had to read the light.
When I get to the letter now, about 300 years later, it's like I'd come back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers is a support from the National Trust Organization and Arts Council of England and the possibility to live at least four months at the top of the dream. (For the truth, I've been a little longer.)
Rhodes traveled time to study a victorian 'new' frontier, traveling archives and studying many costs and curiosity, such as the head of hienes on the walls and the lakes that were taken after centuries.
He passed through the ground and tried the ruins of the old garden, talked with the nice, gardens and sometimes also with the artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
In the night, "I drinked whiskey and write."
The trusted history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust organization has received access to documents until 2006 after the last inheritance, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived in place for ten years later, the employees began to go to the archives that Rhodes described the words, as when “aristokrates of many centurys distract their hands with words: ‘You've been able to fix it.’
The journalists, letters from the British Empire, maps of the surprising materials: “You may think that a lot of ground is noble," said Rhodes, "but I writed on one case when two families were translated to the ground.
Let the people go!"
Some story in the book uses the garden as a smoking mixture and is deeply deeply to English history, including the Labourer, who seeks a man who leaves the new built garden to connect to the English resurrection in 1381.
“ I found a record on a player from 1380, named Knightly Familes of Kent and Sussex, ” said Rhodes.
“ The English resurrection in reality began in this area and I felt that it was a good outcome.
Perhaps it's finally complicated together."
Other story are extremely smoking with the story of the grain - for example The Priest, who announces the story of the Jewish priest who hid Darrello's family after seven years in English reform.
Or the Smuggler on the Pascharack of the 18th century, named Arthur Darrell, who was fully insert of his own tomb when he filled the rocks of stones (which was discovered to a few years later after covering the rabbit).
The favorite family of Rhodes is Darrello: “The man’s generations, and then men were always worthy and lost money for things that they could not allow.
The various generations of Darrell's families resolved that they took rich or old panicks -- I imagine that they were looking ladies who moved the heads of the heritage."
With the end of the residence at the garden of Friday Rhodes after the other welfare.
Recently, he returned from the two-week divorce in the Finnish divorce, where he inspired for his another book about Elemanmack, which was ancient sanitarium from the beginning of the 20th century, which was broken by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
“I was sorrowful when I was gone,” he said.
"I said, "I'm going back to real life."
Washington changes the conditions of training of green cards
The media has published the word of President Donald Trumpa on the new migration plan of the United States, in which the framework will also be changed by the Green Card.
It is considered that the number of legitimate immigrants would be so longer than 50 000 in the consequence of the more relevant rules to make temporary work wines and the restrictions of family waters.
The new rules propose republished and President.

The New Application process of English speaker requests that increase financial media and demonstrate capacity to help our country," introduced Trump, citated media.
Sexual robots are on the assembly - we should be careful
It is just when it seems that the year 2017 can't be weird, it is shown on the Internet a report on the technological development of sexual robots.
Yes.
Sexual robots are actually popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a statement on the development of sexual robots in the next five to ten years.
According to the word of ancient robot professor and intelligence in the Sheffield University and FR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look at sexual robots seriously.
The claimers can choose the colour of the eyes, the face of the brade and the view of the worksheets.
“The people are cutting out of them, but they sell growth and we need to be ready to see them sooner,” she told Sharkey in the opportunity to publish the report.
Moderal sexual assistance is usually changed by Mr. to robotical women with a silicon cook, which is at the dozen very closely dark - self-security is a smart intelligence that imites man’s behavior.
The user can "modify" work to its image - from the eyes color and the face of the broadcast until the view and the color of the necks.
Of course, very concerned is the fact that many robots have the own “humanity ” that would also hate Stepford's panic.
Modern infucture girls were developed in a robot woman with a silicon cook.
The Robot Leader of RealBotix can set up various characteristics, between them and their stimulation.
And then there is a sexy Roxxy Gold company of True Companion, which is added to the programmed persons, including the "Fregid Farrah", which is described by a style consideration and "Wendy" with the "beloved".
"Roxxxy Gold is set to make your personality in the maximum possible way," writes on the True Companion web site.
So she likes what you like and then.
He's even a kidney, like people.
It may be suffered, holiday or “in the ground. ”
Sexual robots are alarming immediately from some reasons - between which does not mean a real relationship between humans. The concerns are most of women's characteristics and violence training, for example frigid (reading low) Farrah.
The True Companion company on its websites likes Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"When you can have a vibrator woman, why wouldn't you have a man of Roxxxy?" writes on the page.
However, sexual robots are not only fatigue or sexual assistance.
Their relationship and at least perfect sophisticness shows something more dark and deeply increasing in our culture - from the ideal or main equation of the direction to the touze after the sudden sex with volunteer.
Most men don't buy a robotical woman, and while FRR talks about their growing favorite, sexual robots remain on the border of the wide public interest.
However, this marginal interest can be made by the current modern time.
And most of the people are not spectacular or violent, until they are attached to the free market.
There is no agreement that these sophistic works are shown in the time when women have their rights throughout the world and in the white house, the president who seats in the woman’s address is often very courageous.
The most horrible aspect of the Serious Serieal The service is not what we see - a living body and excited eyes, as often the reality of these sees.
The book provision of the Service Provision represents a step by the right direction, but in the present time it seems to be a small cross.
Sexual robots have to be the most like of real women (required with pornography).
Their creatives are built to be happy for the treatment and make their first view as a real woman.
However, when their “humanity, ” the robot can’t replace a real woman.
They can't disclose with their partner or just leave.
They don't have any work or story, anything that would be able to make their independence or to deny their devotion to their lord.
Other words, they're a favorite slave.
The 21th century says: service.
The NBA star on the green ground.
Curry fights in California for cut.
The Star Basketballist Stephen Curry has not lost the first challenge at the beginning of the primary start between professional golfists.
A double-assessable maintainer of the NBA played on the tourage Ellie Mae Classic low series Web.com Tour in California Hayward's first round at 74 ran and will fight about cut.
The Golden State, who received the second title in the NBA, was very nervously and his first shooting ended in a drink in the golf car parking in fairwaye.
Even then, it wasn't exactly just as under the basketball board, but he left the ten professional professionals behind him with a bunch of four mornings over the park.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, to have to call a decision, but then it was a little seated," said Curry with that he fell on him a large trimme.
It was a lot of nervous, burning the first day on the tour, but it was all that I hoped.
"If you'd tell me I'd win 74 in the first place, I'd take it immediately," added.
If Curry is able to test a quote that will probably be set up two rounds under the park, it will be the first maintainer of another sport that will prove it on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better and now, when I was freed the treasures, it might be going," he brought the highest golfist, who had already played on the turns of the ceremory and the dreams for amaters and professionals.
In the Hayward starts first on the turns that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received sponsor exception and maintained the Amaterian state.
Serie Web.com Tour is about one category under elite PGA Tour.
The great victory?
In contrast, it's Mitt Romney's health understanding.
The increasing sign of the Trompo Earls is a political training that divide American volunteers and also in micrometers the whole family.
In the Sunday and Thanksgiving, this was in American newspapers with counsel with the relatives who call Trumpa.
We're just waiting for when he allows us nerves.
However, less attention has been taken to the Trempower capacity of the family.
I'm talking about because this week she visited me in New York, my sister, a boss and a fan, living in Chicago, and that in our family was paid for a republic group.
She reminded me that the humbleness of the face in the common enemies could have a strong effect.
Now, with the Trump in the White House, it is the only family - including all of the Republic Countries, with which it had been disagreed about a long-term political policy - on one floor.
It's a good thing at the party of the family table, but it makes me a great risk in the larger context.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has power to exceed us all the right.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we report to the terrible possibility that his chairs can lose a day of attractiveness.
However, there is a longer longer scenario in which Trump “normalises” rural republics who, in contrast to its standards, will disappear the ransom of the rational.
In this day, with the nest in heart, I remember Mitta Romney's and his fat version of the crazy treatment - hot on the car board, 14% of the rice (we had to have aware of his money recognition) - of which both examples appear in comparison with Trump as a very peaceful transaction.
After the department of Trumpa, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be increasing improvement.
We used my sister's visits, and we took children to Central Park on the largest colatotcher who carries the newyor division of parks - for your three dollars you won't find better use if you don't need coffee.
The horses are horses, the central war is hidden by the clauns and the animals are coming and in the front of their own branches - a lot of smoking views and the chinca music's buying music reminds the public transport.
A lot of lyrics are quickly worried: looking of high buildings, panoramas are watched, where the atmosphere and the reality of the city will not be able to show you.
Thirty years later, I still didn't realize that Swiss Cottage is not in reality the Swiss board - not calculating the thematic economy Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
The cooking in the Central Park, however, calls carefully a magic experience, and it's that it's great to be two-year-old children, as well as two murdered women.
If I could value the coloot, it would serve the maximum points, but nobody would ask for happiness.
This week I lived as a similar experience in the area when I was requested at the place of credit card to assess my “bearing” at the distance from one to five.
In the coffee on the road of my street, it's the same that I can get 15% to assessment for something I'm buying behind the pool.
Not only that it disappears a quick selling, but the serveur is such a noise to get into the buyers when it doesn't need.
The woman in the area was sorry with my smiling when I was unfortunately valuing my credit cards for five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital because of the pain to the hruf
This is the second thing I had to be transmitted to the hospital.
The past year was carried out because of the ransoms on the ransoms that, according to the explanation of the prison, he had done himself after a deal.
The Pistorius was witnessed by murder after a call against the original cause of murder.
His friend Steencampo murdered in the early hours in Valentine in 2013 a few shooting mornings through the door of the toalette in his house in Pretoria.
The Pistorius said he's committed her to a crime.
The slaves announced their mind on revoking, this time against the sixth-year penalty of Pistorius, which is under their words too peaceful.

The scientists could observe each step by the monitoring device.
His election found Chhao-Chchao about 12 days later.
The main ticket with the pandle was a minute and half and successfully.
It can also be considered as a small surprise, because the hairs are not considering the most successful love of animals.
The Sami's just badly disturbing the time when the ice is prepared, and they are often low and do not know what to do.
The young child was born healthy and, in the meaning of Chao-chao had to have an extraordinary appetite during the disease, raised 216 grams.
The average rate of new-born panda is lower than 70 grams.

The Samood Netherlands has already been closed for an incidence during the time.
The NVWA Agency Reuters reported that 20 per cent of all the Netherlands employees, which means that 80 per cent of eggs on the market are independent.
The Office indicated that the risk represents only the limited number of types of eggs recognised according to specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the number of toxic substances in small eggs are not predicted, but the potential threat is for children.

Riga is beautiful, it's gonna be a mistake, says the golf Sedelačk and looks for an anguish.
I'd like to take ten years.
"I need to be back there," he spoke the 27th Selacher, who could start a season in a smoke dress.
It's going to get an anguish at the start of a new year.
What were the four years you lived in Lotish?
If I had to value it as in school, then for three.
First year, I wasn't a lot, I had an experimental golman before me.
I learned.
I started catching the second year.
Before the third season, I thought they gave me more space.
But they've brought a new golman with which I've got again.
I thought Loni would still get me.
But during the ten officers, we just got five points, so the trainers started to play.
At the end, I've got my friend more.
But that's what it's doing.
They wanted to get him on the next session.
What was the life in Riz?
Nice.
It's a little Praha.
A beautiful, European, historical city.
I'll be wrong.
I found a friend there.
We're together in the third year, the next year we're going to get back.
So I brought something.
How's KHL for the branch?
The first ten teams are really quality.
Then there are men like us or Slovak, who have to change their hero style against them.
The ability is on the other side, so you have to replace it.
It means to play more back, more to fight.
I didn't see the problem on the wide board.
The differences are that Russians want to play in empty.
It's a lot of shots, and even if they have a empty door before themselves, they're happy to play.
It's just more shooting in Czech.
Didn't you have a problem for traveling and moving over seven time spaces?
If a man has a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep quietly.
The program is most done so you have to play four balls outside and then you have two days free.
How do Lotish take their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole Latin seeks hokes, together with the basketball is a national sport.
Everybody's fancy.
Even though it wasn't happening, many people walked.
Have Dynam contributed to the CHL that Lots on the aircraft of the world has been put to fourth-final?
KHL plays since 2008 and Dinamo is there from the beginning.
And from the same time, their results began to go up to the mystery of the world.
On the olympian 2014 in Sochi falled in fourth final with Canada at 1:2.
That was an unexpected result for them.
Thanks to KHL, it's a higher level.
There are still more flying players in the Czech extraligence.
In Zine, Roberts Bukarts asked and before the sign of the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do they go so much here?
They're not a bottle player, they're really quality.
The outside teams are looking for younger and younger player from the border, Lotish is between them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts for three weeks.
Why are you still without anguish?
On the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Rise.
We started looking for something.
It was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have to pay to the golman, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We were talking about the various teams, but the final decisions were made for someone else.
So I'm training home in Zina and I'm gonna wait when something appears.
You're not nervous?
I was four years ago when I went out of here and didn't know what would be.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I'm at some time home.
I left something in the KHL, so I'm going to get it different.
The question just doesn't know when and where I'm subscribed.
How's the real variant that you're going to divorce a new year?
Everything can stand.
Let's see what's going on for a month where it's going to be.
Now I can just wait for what the agent's talking about.
Are you prefering a party?
It wasn't so much that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The Governing Board on Level continues.
In January, I am in the article with a series of employees?
The basis of the problem remains the same, and then I will allow the comforting passy to remind the article.
The tabernacle in League is talking for many years.
For readers who don't exactly know what's going on, it's probably the best when they look at the official pages of the office of Pete's room of the Year.
In the historical review, the campaign was two miles east from the front of the Year that from 8.1940 he served as a work camp, from 1. 1942 was a collective camp and from 2. 1942 was a cicanic campaign.
In the next text, the transition of life in the board, including the Netherlands conditions, and until March 1943, when the first aircraft prisoners were held in the light transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the exhibition camp.
They were totally 420.
A very serious story of human lives in the world, which have made them human lives and a huge ideal.
It's not much about that this event is necessary to keep reminding.
There is no stress nor that this reminder should be recalled at the memorandum in the place of the suffering of these people.
There's a problem.
For socialism, it was sometimes forgotten at the camp, and in the 70th century, it was near and at the part of the former campaign.
The history of the campaign was in 1992 an American Paul Polansky, in 1995 was a memorandum in Latvia.
In half of the 90th century, the Government promised the purchase and destruction, but it was not yet done.
In 1998, the memorandum was proclaimed by a cultural memory, and since 2009 his administration falled under the Lidice Memory.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee for Human Rights of the Czech Republic invited to close it.
It's so extremely extreme facts about the conspiracy of the campaign.
While the rule was approved by the purchase of price, she decided to be made a finding reason to determine the price.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Government will be sold afterwards.
According to Herman Culture Minister, "No numbers exist, but I'd probably have the purposes if I would go with them to public."
Let's see what's going to bring a good condemnation.
According to some of the non-official disagreements, one hundred million can go, according to others, the price can be achieved to a billion.
As soon as it's not in any case, it's not a lot of case.
However, only a few hundred meters from the former campaign are a memorandum in which the State has invested in 2010 at about 10 million corners.
Even if the United Nations committee for human rights would finance greatly all the transactions, which often doesn't be worse, it would be the same to me to get out of money.
Does the government have no other priorities?
The memorandum, a lot of pity place, is practically in the middle near the tragedy and whoeverever wants, can be here a memorandum of patience and murdered struggle.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's do it as it's, and we'll keep a lot of place with max.
In this case, the Government of the Republic of the Czech Republic should also be responsible for the money of payment funders.
At least with such as in your own business!
Of course, the Ministry of Financial and Office of the Government is not the whole government.
However, I also take a view of the above facts of the ANO chain's password as an empty pre-selectable proclamation.
In May, I came to look right on the place.
A very comfortable coming path, a parking room, replications of tree branches.
In one exposition, in the second integrated WC with tech water.
A small natural amfiteater with the possibility of meeting and with view of its own pitch place created from stones located in a white room.
A lot of flowers and winds.
All attributes corresponding to the significance of this location as well as it is worthy of.
Currently, archeological research is carried out in the place of the original camp.
It would be wise to consider whether a part of the covered bases could not be possible to preserve and access at least visually.
This way would be able to drink his efforts to the Ministry of Daniel Herman's culture.
In the case of the Government, it will be only another unfortunate step in his country's ministry for the ministry.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can reduce the signs of infectious disease (IBD)
For your food system, it may be red flesh and meat products of the night mixture.
However, the new study indicates the right effect: the weight rich on animal protein and the meal products could help to lie from the signs of the infectious disease.
The unleasing disease, which is attached to 1,3 million US and 3000,000 patients in the Great Britain, causes the pains of breast and blood skins, loss of sustainability and extreme disorders.
The patients are usually reminded that not to reduce the signs of meat and meat products. However, the researchers of the Washington University found that the essential aminociselin contained in the protein helps create immunity cells that support the difference.
Dr. Marco Colonna, leading study, explained that the immune cells of protection of the skin and ensure the destruction of fat microbs from food.
The number of objective cells is exceeded by the number of cells that support tolerants and protection of the body, and they would not then be cursed.
While the mixture of the mixture can be achieved to the increasing disease of the stress.
In the framework of research, scientists discovered the existence of immune cells supporting body tolerants in the prison with a specific battery.
This battery requires to create a cell of cryptofan - one of the structure blocks of protein.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one kind of battery - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a common part of the concentration microbiology and the development of cells that support the tolerants of the body.
How much more the cryptofan had the mouse in their fear, so they had more of these immunity cells."
In addition, he suggested that if it shows that it also pays for a person, then the combination of the L. reuter and the pains of riches on the thripofan would help to develop more and less interesting in the environment.
The postgradual research Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the framework of a certain type of immunity cells supporting the body tolerants, declared that one group of testing mouses had these cells while the second group of the same mouses separatedly.
She declared that one of the mouse groups have a difference of stroke microbiums - battery, virus and plots that are regularly living in the gastrointestinal treatment.
The Mouse was tested by DNA series method and researchers found six types of battery in the mouse with immunity cells, which tried the second group of the mouse.
The museum which were running in the sterile environment and mistaked their skin microbios - then this kind of immune cells - was given by the L. reuter - and created immune cells.
To understand how the battery affects the immune system, the researchers increased L. reuter in the technology and then transported a small number of technology - without battery - an immune cell which was stored in the isolation.
Immune cells were developed in tolerant cells.
After removeing the active folders from the techutine, it was shown that it was about the next product of the triptofan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octo.
When the researchers doubled the quantity of the cryptofan in the painting mouse, the quantity of these cells increased in 50%. After the distribution of the cryptofan dose, the rate of half of the cell.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse and most of us keeps the L. Reuter in their gastrointestinal treatment.
It does not know whether the following products of the cryptophane from the L. reuters make cells in the same way as the mouse, but the defects in the genes relating to the cryptophane were detected in people with the illness of medical disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Everyone of us should likely strengthen the development of these cells because they control the ability of the internal level.
Possiblely high level of cryptofan in the present battery L. reuter may increase the population of cells."

He wants a lecture from Pollreich!
The multiple picture began to raise the new order on the TV Prima de Denj Academy.
The fucking shit made a chance immediately.
"Beloved shadow, I'd like to call this to your academy, because you're, your hand on the heart, I think I can learn much from you," he called him in a video on social network.

It's about Lady's kulinary science. It's his own.

The Review of the White House was a $1,000 payers
The decision of the White House to come with the sea helicopter to South Lawn to the opportunity to celebrate the American manufacturer, which was finished last month, has come according to the registrations of the maritime records that gave the TIME weekend for 24,000 dollars.
Greeno, the white helicopter Sicorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One at the time of the president on the paleba, was the top of the programme of 17 July in the White House, which was looking for American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several high officers of the White House observed the overview of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was established near the jagges from Maine, a Wisconsin and a spectacular driving car from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House delivered a fragmentary command or FRAGO and requested the presence of the nearly 36 hours before the helicopters arrived at South Lawn in the framework of the “married” event, reported by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for the control of the helicopters.
“I wanted to ensure that you should have aware of such significant events,” writer HMX-1 in the e-mail to his overseer, the leader of the marine officer for the airport day before the event starts.
The report stated that the helicopter would be achieved at South Lawn 17 July at 7:00 to the opportunity of the survey planning at 15:00 and remained on the place until the full excursion of the entire place planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it continues that, if it comes to the afternoon from the White House, the replacement for return years will be submitted in accordance with the work time Regulation.
The original staff stayed on that evening with the helicopter and also with them a unit of security workers.
From the records - which received the TIME weekend - wasn't appropriate if it was finally sent and the second stage.
Hatch Act takes the State Officers in use of the Government's governance to political objectives.
The notes indicate that HMX-1 examines the possibility of this Regulation.
"It was interested in us if it was Hatch Act and we were sure it's all right," wrote the governor.
“It seems like they lock you,” replied the leader.
This review “Made in America” was marked by the White House as official event and Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But the official events have political subtexts.
In his participation on the events, the President made a healthy reform that had passed by the senate and declared that he would have been able to keep the Government Regulation.
The use of air transport means which are Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are used to travel.
However, their presence is clean because of presentation reasons is innormal.
Trump established a control in the office after the president airport was driving on the back at his first meeting in the campaign in Melbourne in Florida. His Twitter accounts are worthy of use of the president airport.
“The White House is satisfied with “Made in America”, which represented products from all 50 States that produce Americans from the American materials,” said Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopters often treat the accession in Washington and South Lawn and promote the cases with the President of the United States to the White House with the maximum accommodation.
While Trump at the beginning of July in Germany participated in the summit of G-20, HMX-1 had been 58 monthly access to the White House.
Made in America was part of the current training training, a State actor.
The helicopter unit in the same day was found in the framework of “the non-presided subsequent missions” other eleven hours.
The White House pointed out that no other revisions were granted from the money of payments.
The Sikorsky spoke that the company was not interested in the operations of the establishment of helicopters on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain records on the budget for the President's years and the exact costs in relation to the supervisory are difficult to determine in accordance with the expression of marine marine.
According to the Ministry of Defence, a time price for the fishing year 2017, the replacement of DoD for VH-3D 24 380 dollars for aeroplane hour.
We record the units take 30 minutes from the base of Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argued that the actual driving costs of helicopters are significantly moved under this part.
“Authenticating the costs of payment funds based on the replacement of expenditures is very efficient,” said Walters' whole thing.
“There are intended to include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are covered in each year's costs.”
According to the RAND studies from 2015, the replacement of the DoD expenditures do not provide costs for personal, however, the price of pivot, maintenance and contracting costs.
Then the white house Sean Spicer's printer secretary refused to use the helicopters for the objectives of view.
“The idea of the survey that is done this week is to imagine products produced in the United States,” said Spicer.
"I know that the Sicorsky and the state of Connecticut are very courageous in fact that they are involved to defend our state, and that they provide the works for hundreds, not for thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are honourable on the helicopter and the other military devices that are part of the American citizens.
This is the fact that it is necessary to remember."
It's not clear if Trump was in his conference on South Lawn also looked at the helicopter. It's probably possible to say only that he was sitting for a calling one of the Hassican cars.
Returned in the White House Trump the employer of Sikorsky and struggled with the media on his own product flow.
"I know very well," said the President, "I'm my own three."
The young woman was driving in the bathroom at Mach's leather, the police was broadcast with her.
The girl went to the plane on the wednesday for the second hours of the morning.
Instead of buying, but she remained prisoned in the mockers.
When she decided to ask a mobile phone to help the police, she had the last 12 per cent battery.
"For that reason, the policemans have lost the connection," Ivan Balak's police speaker.
In the place she wrote nearly, there were several police shoes, but finding a young woman wasn't very easy.
"Some of the police had to browse a hundred meters of race mockers before they felt a strong land again," she closed Balak.
And like that, it was also beaten.
Policists were oriented according to the direction of her call on help.
"To not come at least about this connection, they agreed to her that the voice will be replied," she said.
Policist woman found a three-four-four-5 in the town of Born.
She was on further physical and psychic forces, and she had signs of subtraction.
That is why the sanitacy called her was carried out to the Czech hospital.
Anybody with STAN?
Of no girls, it's a girl who's sale.
It's a little iron.
His web project has been searched as a billioner of volators based on saying that STAN suffers a deficit of gentlemen.
And he also suggested that political non-profit parts are almost less known and independent, in fact, there is no public programme for smart choices.
Her election candidate is just after talking to the grandmother will be a pleasant man to have any political opinion.
Sometimes he started so much as well as Vit Bart, and it didn't happen so nicely.
His courage to the comprehensive persons and persons that are in case of candidates, and some ancients, which allowed the Guiddian, also the Children's rule and the favorite argument of the STAN bodies, that the greatest value of the depression is just political execution and temptations, traditionally the most favorable policy, and according to the investigations.
Now you're quiet to explore the unknown personality quietly.
The entire divorce with the humanitarian after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, the Guard explained that the challenge does not want to lose his identity on human candidates.
But if STAN has already submitted a little while, the grandmother's coming ends and teaches a game for identity.
Not only ANO Andreje Babische was excited a long time against ANO, on the first common pressure, but the Children who published publicly praised, said, "My goal is to smoke ANO, so the smoke of Starstas has gone to twenty percent in the future options."
Let's hope he's not playing up.
The kid is a successful businesser and a billioner is sure it's not an agreement.
Many of the policy speaks like Babias, in different ways from him, but it does not make its own political tag.
STAN already reminds the reality of show than a real political side and the German helper's hand as if any newspaper would do more for a girl's sale.
Sometimes STAN went with TOP 09, then with the human age and now looks for a good person.
Let's hope someone calls.

GMB concerns investment in McVitie's company in Glasgow
The departments require a confirmation from the manufacturers of McVitie's managers for the long-term products in the company in Glasgow.
The Scotland Research GMB stated that the company was in case of case investment in the company in the Tollcross area.
In the company it works more than 500 employees that produce other products and hobnob sugars and Rich Tea.
Maintainer McVitie's, the Pladis company, showed that in the framework of several years ago he invested in the whole area of more than 5 million books.
He added that employees and employees will be "first information" in the case of the amendment of the company.
In the letter of the establishment company, the Scope GMB declared their concern that McVitie's 's' will not be promised to finance and modernization of producing lines.
The GMB Drew Duffy main organizator added: “Fact that we have not received clear answers from the structure of the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very concerned for our members.
Many families and employees work here are most of the local community and the Glasgow areas, where the work in more industrially represents critical employment in the area of high-employment and social expenditure.
From the view of work, payments and efforts - and with the view of Brexit, contributing to the costs of life, and cutting the old production - needs an east part of Glasgow’s prosperant productor as McVitie's."
Pladis’s speaking company said: “Tollcross has received letters from GMB yesterday and the company gives a statement first because we preserve the continuing obligation for employers and deputors.
A regular meeting with employee and GMB managers in Tollcross was held two months ago and on this meeting was openly discussed about many problems.
We spoke to the employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and increasing economic conditions, we assess our execution on a regular basis, which is paying for all our works to continue to competition with others.
He added: “In recent years, we invested 5 million books in the Tollcross area, especially to the production lines and the efficiency of the production.
Tollcross' heritage is very precious and more localities and, if any changes in the process, the employees and the employees of the officers will not be published."
Did she warn the PSG Barcelon to move Neymara three years ago?
La Liga will be able to betray her interest on Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to get Neymar on his side after 189 million £, so the number of needed to purchase Neymara from the contract, but warned this French team Barcelon about his record travel for three years ago?
This abstract transition has developed the aircraft waters. Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than doublely previous records for Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which payed for him in the lonely season 89 million £.
After confirming and completed transfers, Neymar will become the most oldest player of the world and even the best placed professional sports in the world - after the view of the PSG team will be offered over 500 000 £ for week.
Barcelona is declined by the way Neymar exported out of his contract, especially that the trusted source confirmed that the club has always tried to Neymar in all of his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, was the photobal world warned by President PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City was expressed his interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelafi warned all clubs that would be interested in breaking one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not afraid, because when someone's trying to get one of our players, then we're absolutely delighting one of their players," said Al-Khelafi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if he's trying to get one of our players, they're going to fulfill the consequences."
It seems that Barcelona has passed through the mental border when she was interested in the PSG booker Mark Verratti in the year.
The PSG was clearly expressed in the meaning that no circumstances allowed the expenditure of the Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelon is now for his fuel treatment now with Neymar's department.
Who explains the sanctuary?
Does he have a political punishment of a wide understandable rules?
Donald Trump's shooting on the anti-round sanction.
The day before the United States, the sanctuary of the Venezuela President Madura.
And on the day before Trump wrote that China doesn't do anything with the North Korean grave and that's not going to happen.
And that's the idea of the sanks as the slams of the boat.
These things can't be home in one pill.
Madur Venezuela really expressed the way to the dictor, but totally.
China's just like the American President would like to do it.
Russia's chapter for himself.
But if anyone wanted to assemble all this, so that a regular choice, American, European or other, he would understand what he expects, and how the system of rules are operating in sanction policy would have been at least impossible.
In the sanks against Russia, President Trump only applies what has already been found by President Obama, just gave it an executive ratio.
So why's this?
Loni was surprised at Europe if he won the American choices of Trump, we're both with Putin and call the sanks.
It's a terrible presence.
It's in the praxis, but it's on the other side.
They don't leave the sanks with Trump, but they're condemned.
Only Europe's worried more.
The German Ministry of Zypries says that the Trumpo sanctuary dismiss the international law.
Is that like the shoes are only sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
But they are not cutting or contrary sanctions of the EU.
Boss of the European Commission Juncker reiterates that the Trumpet sanctions energy security of the EU.
That's how they're going to use sanks just so bad that they don't offer anyone?
It's a normal boxer.
Three years he heard that the Court of Anti-Russian Sanks is intended only to fulfil the Mines Agreement on the purpose of Ukraine.
Now it is known that it is about the EU energy security.
I'm going to call the tape and I'm scared.
The sanks are coming to Russia because they're moving too much where she's not.
China's busy because it's mounting a little bit.
Venezuela President is punished because he built a diktature in the borders of his country.
All those trespasses or only the concerns have their rationality.
But you see somebody in that system, line or rules?
Andrej Babiš: I don't think of cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, cross the Republic with his Visionary Book and finishs the optional program.
Except Parduba countries are already prepared for all candidates.
According to his words, he didn't explicitly interpreted them.
He even agreed to lead the officer and the Scientific Minister of School ANO Ivo Vondrák here.
"But if he's successful, he'll have to choose whether he wants to be a messenger or a captain," confirmed his previous opinion of Babies.
Many employees and global policies you have found that the voting of officers and privators should lead foreign and cities, only with managers.
Are you serious?
That wasn't it.
I'm a friend of the right democracy, we call the President directly, and I'm sure we should call the same ones and the elders and privates.
In my book, I don't talk about the loss of the prisoners, they can be quiet there.
The question is how much it will be.
When you presented your book About what I dream when I sleep, I heard on my own ear that you talked about the interruption of the distract.
I don't remember that.
I talked about the right choice and reduction of the number of employees.
New York with nine million citizens have five districts and 51 prisoners.
Prayer with 1,2 million citizens has 1171 employees.
And the primator says that it's a lot of structures and hasn't prepared large projects, but she doesn't have competence for it.
It also pays the government that only two people led in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I don't say they did it well.
The current premier doesn't rule anything, but he just modifys the debat.
So it can't work.
That's why you want to make a majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to make it.
In the program, we only have a change to a single choice to the Senat.
We also rejected the courageous mandate of the Ministers and the Treaty of the Treaty of Agency, that the rest of the messengers who have to work in the Commission and in the Committees should not prevent their meetings.
It's not true that I want to destroy the Parliament's system.
It's just exactly what your resents are afraid.
As a director you will guide the government, control with 101 messengers, cancel the country and Senat and through thankful concerns and privators, you will control the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
But it's not bad about when we're discussing the number of messengers.
The French President Macron announced the reduction of the legal congregation on third party, and there is 57 thousand Frances, while this is 17,000 Czechs.
Macrona, however, doesn't commit a democracy.
Even if somebody won choices most of us, we have mechanisms that would refuse him to do some dramatic changes.
Freedoms for those who have the majority of the Parliament, but are great, is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
There's nothing in the case of ANO's steal.
We just need a team that will work for people, not for our party or restaurants.
I don't need to understand why we couldn't agree that it increases only the payment of teachers, employers in culture and social services.
Why have they spoken me and added 21 per cent to the BIBS advice that now take 60 thousand now?
Would you like the Premier do that?
The Premier must be inquired when the Ministry are inequality, they will fulfill the government with the travel officers, and for the money of the State they would like to buy as Marian Jurečk, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and to go in Africa.
The Ministry in the government doesn't have a question, the disputes have to say outside her.
In the cabinet, there is no place for coalition, powerful voice and chess, there must be decided.
How do you want to have a competent team when the Ministry maintains most sides?
On the sides, it's a basic law.
When she came to lamb bread, the Sobotk said that the coal agreement would not pay, and that Baby shot out of the government.
It can do every premier.
But if it's personality and has guidance capacity, the similar gest plan doesn't need.
He believes all the same, and he needs a perfect exercise from everyone.
Do you already know who you're supposed to make the Financial Ministry?
I don't think of that, for we're not going to do that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
There's so much ships in the place.
Ancients have received Anybody's businesser who would like to cooperate with you, may win you a thief of the Jersey Champion.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomir Zaoralec, which doesn't interpret with ANO, may be prosecuted by Vaclav Klaus, which will not be contrary.
I'd let it be on the pills.
Vice-Premier and ANO ANO Richard Brabec said that you have a lot of common points with the SPD Tomia Okamur, for example in the area of economic.
So the ocamurovs are in consideration as a coal partner?
Mr. Brabec doesn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, candidate as Vita Barty for VV, then he got the money for his company, and there was a puzzle.
Of course, he's a explicit person.
Of course, she's on somewhere.
When I take his programme, there is a wide introduction of people to management society, direct democracy, and it will be agreed.
I don't ask you anyway.
Is it interested in me if it's an acceptable person who has xenofic opinions, speaking on demonstrations with the cybers and wanting to go out of the EU?
We don't think of cooperation with Mr. Okamur, I can't imagine it.
It's obvious that he went to the policy to profess her.
What are those supports of the communists of your minor government?
I can't imagine it, but I'm a choice.
It will be about winning with others in order, but God knows who will win and who two.
Of course, it is important that they can agree with the Coalition Government Programme.
Let's go back to your way to drive as a company.
But the government just needs to lead, the president of Sobotk left everything out, he never decided.
Coalitional matters such as CEB or EGAP were not functioned.
Because the Sobotka is his lot, and that was the reason why he declined me.
As he did, the Czech Government controlled.
It is, however, incredible that the Prime Minister has brought the receipt of the written CEZ Management, which provides the Minister's Financial Assembly to vote to the Valent CEZ.
If you become a premisher, will you change personal measures in the supervisory Council and replace the CEZ super-chool management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a Premier, he'll see it.
I'm not her yet.
It's happy that the CEZ has already sent signals to your direction.
Good cooperation with the CSSD would like to change for better with ANO.
So, after choices, everything's going again.
I don't know about it.
I don't have a lobby or a Royal Lobby, I'm a single unit, and I'm not going to solve it.
So answer directly.
If you are in the government, you will encourage the exchange of the Chess, the Czech TV or the Universal Health Safety, then what institutions you criticize?
I'd like to make the CEZ a transparency.
He did what he wanted for all years, and I give thanks for traditional political parties.
It's enough to look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has been in the Chez's majority, he never guided him, he was just in a number that's wrong.
It's trivial for me.
CHEZ shall take Dukovany, appreciate them, attach them to the girlfriends, to finance, to make additional concurrents or to make coinvestors and to set a new nuclear block.
The concept that State has to finance and create new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about the Czech TV?
Some of her orders against me are leading a permanent target campaign, but I have no competence to get out of anybody.
But controling yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that the citizens pay for public speaking and TV packs of 7,2 billion yearly, but they don't really know how these institutions are economic.
How do they don't know?
However, it approves the report of their economy, which is directly influenced on the positions of the General Directors of CT and CRO.
See how these reports are published, the super powerful Sobotka Calousek, who always worked.
It pays it as the present Parliament Commission to the investigation letters, as well as to the Lex Babiš.
And the Sobotk was so stupid that he left Calus to get me out of the government, which took the TOP 09 percent, but CHSSD was cut off.
They fear their corruption system, and they say about the democracy of Babylon.
Nobody is immune.
What do you say to the articles described, how the First Chairman ANO Jaroslav Faltyn builds a powerful border that he adds a son to the supervisor of the Teplorhen Brno and guards the companies with the citizens and the State Companies, such as the Prash transport business or the Czech Roads?
We've got a lot in that.
I don't like that, and I counted it sometimes.
The falt arguments that the restricted lawyer works for a particularly smaller rate and is compatible.
I wouldn't do that.
I didn't have anybody as the Financial Ministry.
We were born from socanics, never had a corruption, no Pelt, Kratochville, Brazil.
If we had a name of clientism, we've made this person out once.
I'm not commissible in this direction.
If something happens, we'll save anyone, it's just one who would be.
