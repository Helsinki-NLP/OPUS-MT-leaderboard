The American President Barack Obama will turn to Oslo in Norway to pass 26 hours and be the fourth American president of the history to receive the Nobel Price of Peace.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be delivered to him for its exceptional efforts to strengthen the world diplomacy and cooperation between the nations.
The officer of the White House and his wife Michelle will driving tomorrow in the northern metropolis and will have a loaded program.
It will first come to the Nobel Institute, where he will first meet the five members of the Committee who have chosen it in October between 172 and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple was then proposed to interview with the King of Norvege Harald V and the Queen Sonja.
The visit will recognize its summary in the next day in a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
It will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third who will see the price in the presence of the Committee.
The White House informed the presence that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price is delivered.
The President does not want to disappear that matter because it is aware that he receives this price as a president who brings a war in two countries at the present time.
He strengthened war efforts for a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which no of its critical criteria would forget to subline.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million of Sweden corners (how 1,1 million euros).
It is considered to be given to welfare works, but he has still not decided specifically.
His loaded programme will then take him and his wife to a bank included, in addition to the king and the Queen of Norway, the Government's head and 250 other invitations.
Obama was immediately amounted to this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned the feeling of not to meet it completely.
He also repeated several times that he is not a price for himself, but for all who defend the same values as he.
After the announcement, he said that it would be for him a "invitation to act."
A defender of the nature accused of singing
The police of Litomaurice and included challenge to the President of the Association Association of the Protectors of the Nature of Litomaurice.
In several times in the last year, he called for several construction procedures and requested the money of investors for his personal benefit in the retail of his call, said Alena Romová, the port-word of the police of Litomaurice.
The President of the Society of the Protectors of the Nature of Litoměricice is Lubomir Studnička.
It is currently in detention and risks until three years of disappointment.
The trial of decades are not in Brno's parfum
In Prague, everybody can build his bottles of drinks, while in the towns of South Moravia you fall on branches of trial at each street road.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a couple of minutes before you find the appropriate goods.
I don't mean we wouldn't try from all the decades in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal counselers of our city, the second larger town of the country, do not have enough interest in this problem.
Brno is in the age of stone of the trial of disagreements not only because citizens can still choose only the paper, the verre and the PVC, but especially the number of benefits given to these deadlines.
Have you already tried to get a plastic bottle in the center-ville?
It's all a science, which requires most of the time and acetic nerves.
The only place I found for the moment is the place of the Moravie in face of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Undka and his colleagues don't want me to, but it looks sacred.
Unless talking about the fact that in other town rooms, it's not an uncertainty.
So, for the end, many of my friends don't tried their decades.
By Paris.
It makes them a threat to get up to the branches.
I don't care about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go to get some green and PVC bottles.
Unless I've seen any color color beans of Kounicova.
Happyly I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
This says, the decades were disappeared.
It's after the center of Brno, who's going to represent the best city, right?
It is probably not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy a place in the city in the first hokey library that makes the city hungry in all the country, instead of buying a few additional goods and offering the trial of more materials for a better Brno.
I'm happy that I could strengthen my impression with official statistics after I've trained a moment on the Internet.
According to the data of the ECO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst of all South Moravia regions.
Paroubek's budget was removed from the retraated money and the disease conges
After the left increased, although the opinion of the Government, agricultors or officers, it may have no money for retraits, disease conges or disease lives.
But also for interests on the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of the next year, reporting the Ministry of Eduard Janota's Finance.
When social democracy and communists imposed the increase for certain classs, they were based on the fact that the government would make emphasis for sensitive expenditure, retraits or disease.
It is necessary to know that the interests to pay are higher and that it will be necessary to return it early or later.
The State really doesn't have the choice to know where to get money.
If he does not decline social support or expenditure, he should increase the imposes.
All those who have currently increased: bombers, institutions, agricultors.
And afterward, their children.
People will touch them and don't have to fear for their retraits or their diseases, which have lost 1,8 billion.
But in the expenditure of a larger end of the State - the next year will not have 163 billion in the box, but more.
Instead of the efforts of the Ministry Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it, the expenditures related to interests.
The State will need money to repeat it and will no longer increase the TVA or reduce the maternity congest as the Government has done in its antideficit package.
It will also miss five billion to fulfil the constructions of road and ferrored routes due to the transfer of money to several electoral groups.
It is mainly of already decided and encountered trends, which is not possible to change projects to reduce the costs eventually.
Instead of keeping them, what wasn't free yet.
This means to stop or stop thirty large chats, and the preliminary of the European funds is also in danger, according to the implementation of Karel Hanzelka, port-word of the Minister of Transport.
The CSSD proposed to resolve the financial deficit very advertisedly - it would be possible in the CEZ distributors (electric energy distributor), which the State has a larger part and will feed the transport funds.
It is that the amount of divisions is never certain and that it is not in any case of a non-font puzzle.
The last year, these are 18 billion that have been shipped from the CEZ to the budget.
Each year, the shareholders serve to pay the elimination of ecological delays, to complete the accounts of retraits or to serve reserve for the reform of the retraits prepared.
Furthermore, this assistance increases the real deficit of the budget of 5,7 per cent of the PNB in accordance with the EU rules.
And it's far from be the end of the transfer carnaval.
The budget for various degradations to the victims of communism and delicts, even in the apartment of residence, has decreased about three billion.
It's not sure that the State can do without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive a international procedure, we must pay it all ways, says Janota.
The Ministry should then economise from the Department or, in the worst case, to touch the budgetary reserve of the Government.
It is also missing hundreds of million in the State box project of a value of two billion, which must allow the rate of each administration to follow.
The first step begins in January.
If the Ministry of Financial Financials had no more money, the project should be stopped and sanctions would be located, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans visit a port phone that allows the user to pass from an operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been discovered appear to be promised.
It's enough a button and you're going from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is exactly this opportunity that is the objective of the US VMware society, which is mainly occupied of the development of virtualisation software for computers.
We will allow you to handle two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, showed Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware society in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was made a first demonstration for a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not exceed any of the fiction.
VMware has already submitted successfully a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executes the Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new mobile phone technologies is full of extortion.
The VMware company is now collaborated with European and American operators to test virtualisation on smartphones, and clients should have access to the current devices 2012.
The snow penalty in the mountain tracks the hosts
The desert tracks do not have problems only for remote-pont operators.
The missing of snow disturbs people to keep their lives in the hotels and pensions.
In fact, it is always possible to decline free rooms for all the date in the hiver, including Noël and the New Year.
We have many visits on our site.
The internal persons see the offers, ask prices, but don't want to reserve for the time.
And if they call us, they're asking if there's a snow or a snow in Noël," said Martin Jandura, operating from the Spindl.Info.
If we want to pass the New Year of his dreams to Spindler's Mlyn, it is better not too hex to reserve.
If it gives the priority to the economy and that the quality of the holiday is only then, we can try to wait for more than a few days.
Spindler's hotels propose for the moment only a week's home for the New Year.
I think they're going to try again a moment to place them, but they'll also take them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," he appreciated Jandura.
The tourism Agency of the Vrchlabi is also proposed free beds for all hiver periods.
The week of Noël interests us most for the time, it is not completely sold.
He remains free, we say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared a few neighborhoods in the last minute," indicated the Director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agent of Vrchlabi can also propose the New An at Krkonosche, but there are less free places.
The fourteen first days of February are also party, the residents of Hiverns are in the middle.
This year, the interest for hiver lives has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonosche.
People expect her to fall down.
Nobody wants to pass the hiver to the mount without snow.
If the tracks are recovered during the week, Noël will also be full," thinks Shiefert.
In contrast, the occupation of the hotel Horizont in Pec Pod Sniežkou is easily higher than last year.
We have a little improvement of about five percent.
We have a few recent places for the New Year as for Noël.
There is a great interest during the January vacances of Poland and February sell well," reports Karel Rada, director of Pec's best hotel.
The hotel Omnia near the centre parking of Janskie Lazana is also full of 40 per cent during the period of Nouvel Year.
In contrast, half of beds remains empty in Noël in the last hotel of Yansche Lazana.
This year, we were graciously surprised by the month of January, where we have already been sixty per cent of work at the present time.
February is a little lower for the moment, but when the snow falls, the interest for the residents in the Krkonoses will certainly have indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, the Krkonosche hosts do not have to hope more of snow.
Jeudi will make more free, and if there are precipits, they should be neglected in the mountain.
But afterward, the time should be reached, report Jirze Jakubski of the Hradec station of the Chec Hydrometerological Institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
It is even complicated, the effort that Barack Obama, President of the Scientific Reputation, played the strategy of his President on the Afghanistan question, which he considered himself as simple.
When he finished to leave his doctrine so hardly expected, he had been recognized to the carbon paper from the Iraqian scenario of Bush since three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even many times the expression "come in Iraq," he has no hesitate, which is, more, to use the title of Bush of January 2007 as the title of his own talks: "A new route before"
At the same time, he personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new strengths into an Iraq consumed by civil war as "in responsible and catastrophical decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that the Bush strategy, which emerged the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and acceptable success in the same way that the journals in the present time are not talking about all of Iraq.
This has not improved Bush' reputation, which says, Objectively speaking, he left his followers a most favorable situation than we couldn't hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will be played
These are the captains of campaigns who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the African operation, the General Stanley McCristal, who also criticized the reticences of the White House on the basis of subordination.
He asked for 40 000 men to make the most favorable situation.
The Chairman has held up for three months but by default a better option, at least the general of 10 000 soldiers.
He succeeded to eliminate the promise of 5000 additional from Europe, even if he had numbered over 10 000 in the origin.
The most problems in all Obama strategy appears to be his intention to remove the armies from Afghanistan from here 18 months and to finish all this process from here three years.
Many doubts that a half increase will bring the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Unless the fractricised wars of these last years, the Iraq society is relatively organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
Afghanistan's situation starts by the opposite fact - can't be counted on anyone and no treatment is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare African Security Forces, which are used to change leaders on the day according to their arrangements.
Political institutions, although officially funded, will only remain in the eye behind which the patriarch ethnic relations will prolifer.
It is simplely complex to equate the interests of various ethnic groups with regard to reports, which are still complied by the Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state prompt to do", which is the basis of the operation, doesn't seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama strategy perplexes by its volontarian.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only been emphasised and it is currently at the border of the caos.
Only a pure romantic heart and outside the reality can be persuaded that small soldiers sent into the war's tower for their "prompt return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
In a political view, definition of a date for the retreat of the groups is clearly irresponsible because the Talibans will consider it as the indirect obstacle of the American deficit.
The last summary of the OTAN showed that the desire of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is the negative.
European policies do not know nor want to explain to their electorers where security in Germany or Italy is connected to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor can be able to rarely reach the situation is the evolution of the events linked to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the strengthened sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will focus on the very difficult question of a problem resolution by the military force.
For example, it should be responsible for the time that, according to Obama, America will come to the victoriate to Afghanistan's groups.
However, each solution of this type will bring a dramatic return of the African situation.
The only silence for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore it remains a long time for a new strategy, in the case that it would be a total fashion.
The managers of the Goldman Sachs bank will not receive more prices in liquid money
High employees in the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive this year of prices in species.
The company announced it to react to strong critics on its salary practices.
The group of 30 major leaders will receive actions instead of money, that they can't return five years ago.
The actions may be removed to the leaders in the case they would take too many risks.
Following Reuters, Goldman Sachs sets up so on a file of efforts to release retributions with long-term performances in Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well known about the global sense that he needs to take, indicated the old bank of investment Douglas Elliott of the JPMorgan society
The detail is in the detail, has added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after he had been set at nearly 17 billion dollars for prices on the first three trimesters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of prices will probably be over 20 billion dollars at least the stated measure today, according to the Reuters agent.
With the achievement of the financial crisis, the strong prices of the bank sector became a sensitive political subject in many countries.
The Great Britain announced mercred that it had a total rate of 50 per cent of the bankers over 25,000 books.
France prepares similar measures.
This year women have received Nobel price in all horrible areas of physical
These are five women, a record number, which received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel prices in technical and literature.
Further than the four scientists, there was also the German writer of the Roman origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriory Jack Sostak the medical Nobel price for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was declared to the Israeli Adda Jonathan with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to light the structure and the function of ribosoms
The last lauréat received the Nobel Economic Price, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriote Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of the economic government.
The only technical discipline that has not been lauréate this year was physical.
This price has been delivered to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the area of optic fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD puzzles, which are currently based on all digital, fax or astronomical photography devices.
Each lauréat received the diploma, Nobel medal, and the accommodation certificate of the criminal reward.
This is about 10 million of Sweden corners in each category. (About 1,1 million euros)
If one of them belongs to several lourishes, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected Nobel Price of Peace has already been remitted this afternoon to Oslo in Norway to the American President Barack Obama.
This, in his talk, recognized the controversy nature of his reward since it is only at the beginning of his parking and that he is in the head of a country entered into two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
The Ministry Janota advised to demission. Klaus invited him to Château
President Vaclav Klaus will receive the Ministry of Eduard Janota's Financial Financial Finances, which will take its residence to the Government of the fact of its disagreement with the State budget for the next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputy
It is estimated that the budget and maybe the position of Janota on the campaign will be on the agenda of the Friday.
Klaus is also critical to the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of public finances.
This is the president of the President Radim Ochvat, who has reported about the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his lunch function with the first Ministry Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion corees that the Czech Republic should be governed.
However, the deputy room has valid the proposals of the left on money transfers and has increased the retributions of officers, the functioning of social services and direct contributions to agricultors.
The Government requested the proposals of democratic society that they would indirectly increase the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between the left of one part, the Government, Klaus and the right of the other part, agreed that the future of the Fisher's campaign who had been formed in accordance between the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Partie.
The criteria claims that the budget, as it has been voted by the deputy, removes the package of economic measures past by the Government of Fischer, and who must apply to him the commitment of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the budget of the State, but that it is nothing obvious, has stated today in a small-term conversation with enterprises, that the policies have long-termly denied the "great problem" of the "increasing deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is no favorable solution according to him.
Only a strong government could provide a improvement, if it could be able to support a consensus of the most largest political parties, according to the President.
The President of the ODS Mireck Topolánek stated that the budget is exploring and that the government should be replaced by its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Peter Netem stated to the CTK that the idea of a administrative campaign supported by CSSD, ODS and Verts is not clearly working.
In his reaction, the First Minister Fischer qualified such words of "drastical verdicts".
The chief of the CSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolanek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the old Government of Topolanek is exploring and that he will exceed 200 billion corony.
Mercedes already, the CSSD has succeeded the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film
Despite critics of the fact that the major roles are played by American actors, South Africans show that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu will expose many things to the world on the country, its fights and its victories.
The story talks about sports, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded to Oscars, incarcers the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, infectible fighting against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman stated that he was a 40-year-old Mandela who asked him to carry him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarcer you, I should be able to see you personally.
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was rewarded from a price for his role in the Millennium Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood in the middle of the box, for example, incarned leader of a movement against the slavery, became himself slave, a physical president of the United States, even God in the Evan All-Public film, but never have been a living and important person as well as Mandela.
The ex-man of South African State has been held 27 years for his work for the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He was released free in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993, Nobel's price of peace was decreed.
Invictus is a Latin word that means invaincus and is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The defiance was to talk like him.
The film reports the real story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the Captain of the South African Rugby team of France to join the country. President Mandela newly chose that his country remains and still divided racially and economicly after the apartment.
He is sure that he can join his people by sport and decides to join rugby players among the outsides in the world.
The South African team will end progress in the world's Coupe in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on a big screen.
I wasn't else but if I had to play this role in order to get it closer to the most reality, he said Freeman.
The biggest deficit for me was sure to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to meet him, to be cool before his conversation.
The most important for him was to shoot his hand.
I realized that when I shoot your hand, I get your energy, she moved, and I had the impression to know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the François Pienaar film, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare a role in the midst of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I dreamed at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I seemed greater in the film."
Although the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the Eastwood realisator has received positive opinions and it is even talking about ambitions for Oscars.
The crisis of films Todd McCarthy of the Daily Varety's journal repeated his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film assessments on the Rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 per cent of positive appreciations.
The mystery of the air in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a fuse
We could observe a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russ Defence Minister recognized that yesterday had tested an intercontinent balistic fuse not far from Norway borders.
However, the launch has yet been a failure and the misile of type "Bulava" that should be the honour of the Russian Army become progressively the cutting of Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during the fuse tests did not result on the success of the test vols.
Most of the time, or Bulva has not been involving, or it has been fulfilled.
The Russian journals speak about "Bulava" as "mixil that doesn't fly"
A missile who doesn't want, but who's brilliant
This 13th trial was normally disrupted at the beginning.
It's just at the end of the flight that there's again a deal on the device.
It's clearly the engine of the third stage of the fuse that explored.
This time, "Bulava" was involving the nuclear submarine Dmitri Donskij that was shipping under the white sea.
This type of mission may be just put into fire of a motion and embarkment
That is why the mystery of light above the Norway caused by an unidentified volante object was truly defected by a "Bulava" defect.
On the other hand, the Norwegians did not suffer a moment that it was a Russian fuse.
Generals say that this time, we can't talk absolutely about mistakes.
The two first stages of the fuse has been respirated and the aircraft only touched the third.
In the previous cases, motors have known disasters on the first stage.
Even if no test launching has passed without accrocking, the Ministry's direction consists that only six on thirty have been missing.
This successrate of almost 50 per cent is therefore fulfilled by the generals of optimism, so they always show that a day "Bulava" will flee without problems and that it even brings ten hypersonic nuclear neighborhoods of a total rate of 1,15 tonnes.
The Fetissov lawyer signed 51 years an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow
The Viatchelav Fetissov Legend Defender will be presented again in a professional match at 51 years.
The old campion of the world, olympical campion and detender of Stanley Cup will offer manufacturer to his CSKA Moscow team in the need and will make its possible entrance in the match of feeding against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who has finished his carrier at 40 years in 1998, is the president of CSKA for the time.
After the wound of Denis Kuliash, we need another defender.
Fetissov regularly enters and agrees to help the team.
We have to still set some details on the form, state the coach of Sergey Nyemtchinov club, cited by the AP agent.
It wasn't determined if the hokey player's eating was only one match.

Hyundai has listed to syndicates and canceled all additional hours
The direction of Hyundai of Noshovice was agreed with syndicates to cancel all additional hours.
It is just because of additional times that syndicates have stated a lunch urgency state.
The port speaker Peter Vagnek of the Hyundai has confirmed it.
However, the direction will still agree with syndicates on a Sabbath worked this year.
We can't renew our production plan, it is essential, for the reason that the voluntary additional hours have been proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there were two teams, said Vaunek.
The 7mička.cz website indicated that the company proposed a good 400 Cheques corners to the salaries who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be assigned to posterior for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vañik, decided to change the way to motivate its salaries in additional hours.
After they receive the addition for more hours, or they can put a replacement congest on 28 December and so long their final year feasts for Vañek.
Moreover, all the salaries present on the Sabbath will receive a compensation for transport costs and to meet them.
In view of the fact that additional hours were the most urgent and the heavy point in the comments and syndicates, as soldiers who spontanially stopped the production last week, the direction decided immediately to renew all additional hours for December, Vaunak.
Before the last week, the automobile salaries were forced to work almost two more hours in more than eight hours.
Syndicates cancel the status of greedy after the signature of the agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the vehicle and syndicates must be celebrated afternoon.
The syndical manager Peter Kucharer stated mercredi that they were ready to disappear the state of greeve in case of their revendications and signature of a common document.
The situation in the use has recently built on merchandise when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously spontaneous because of additional hours.
They also protested the bad payment and insurance conditions.
The direction was defenced with the fact that the salaries had to work in addition to fulfil the imperatives for automobile production.
The syndicates also asked that the soldiers who had stopped production would not be submitted to any sanction.
Syndicates request the company to reduce the past time in additional hours at the minimum.
Moreover, this year they want a reward of 5000 coronys (209 €) for these.
The autobus Hyundai de Noshovice currently works 2 000 people.
She started the production in series last year in November.
She manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Detective: a substance that works on HIV virus "indulgent" also
A team of technical and German scientists test new combinations that can raise the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
The main increase of improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed an immunity for medicines.
This reality, in some cases, takes up the fact that the combination is not even intensely in the current variables of virus, even as some already available medicines.
It is not possible to heal the AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of diseases can be rarely prolonged through a measure of medicines that prevent the multiplication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption includes a series of secondary effects.
Furthermore, the repression of this multiplying has the development of what is called resident viruses on which medicines have no effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the Academy of Scientific Republic of the Czech Republic, the Prague VCHT and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to face the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalcarborians act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalcarborians are a assembly of bow, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of virus in a different way of all the medicines employed until now, and therefore they could overcome the problem of resistence.
The work of researchers brings them to discover new "amplexed substances", based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanic of their connections on the proteins of the virus.
Metalcarbones have a unique tridimensional structure: two multiple pairs are formed by egg, hydrogen and carbon and linked by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus training and resident.
The protease of HIV is a protein of HIV virus that is indispensable in the virus life cycle.
Without the division of VIH virus caused by HIV protease there would not be born of infected parts of the virus.
If the HIV Protease is stopped, the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient will also be stopped, explaining researchers in a press-communication published by the Institute of organic chemicals and biochemics of the sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their works published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two couples of cages (cf. table) are linked by an organic chain court, which is systematically modified.
A little more lower than faithful.
The efficiency of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in tests and on its resident variants, obtained with patients held by HIV.
At the current enzyme, the effect of metalcarborians is not so strong as on clinical medicines, however, it does not fail to resistent versions against which the current medicines often are ineffective.
The metalcarborians, with their unique action mechanism and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are also interesting combinations to examine further to the implementation of effective medicines against HIV, ensure Pavlina Rosezacz, Director of the structural Biology Laboratory of the organic and biological Institute and the Molecular Academy Ademia.
Deputy around the budget. ODS takes it to Fischer, who defends
The President of the ODS (democratic citizen party), Mireck Topolánek, was "effecting" the ratified budget for the next year and according to him, the Government of the First Ministry Jan Fischer should reach its existence.
The Prime Minister qualified the proposals of the Drastic Verdict ODS.
He said to take time to analyze.
The ODS Peter Netem’s door-word stated that the idea of a administrative campaign supported by the CHSSD, ODS and the Green Partie was not clearly working.
After Netem, the Government's captain should decide if he is in the room of deputy support for minority who is concerned to fight the growing deficit, or if he is concerned to stay in its functions with the support of the Parliamentary left.
At times, he warned that the positions of the ODS and democratic society in relation to the problem of public deficits are dynamically opposed.
The Chamber of the Deputys ratified the budget for 2010, however, with the proposals of changes to the height of 12 billion coronys including the left.
The Chamber increased the money for the officers' payments, the functioning of social services and direct payments to agricultors.
The grief of the Government against the proposals of democratic society was the fact that they were indirectly increased by the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion core.
The ODS left the room before the vote, so obeying the Government's desire as a changed budget is a less bad variation than a internal budget.
Deception and inutility
The Ministry of Financial Eduard Janota has spoken of deception and feelings of implicitness, the first Minister Jan Fischer stated that the Government will still think about the current situation.
At the time, it is convinced that if Janota would wish to leave its functions in ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took you tomorrow with the Prime Minister after his pass to the government:
He said in the same time that he was asked if he was going to stay in his functions.
His deceit about negotiations around the budget is reasonable.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budgetary deficit, the representatives of the CSSD, which have imposed the changes of the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The first Minister should also say clearly that he will demission if the room ratifiers the other laws increasing the deficit, for example those who touch the insurance of the disease, retreats or the reform of the law on the services.
Topolanek: the Ministers named by the ODS are not reasonable.
This is the case of the Government's captain Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers named the ODS did nothing prejudicial, sublineed Topolánek in a textual communicated from the United States.
He recalled that the Vice- Ministry of certain Ministry rejected TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
At least, if Fischer decided to give his demission to the fact that he was struggled against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "It's actually logical and correct that he is based on the left majority that is currently at the room."
This says, he must not wait for the support and tolerance of the democracies.
I didn't think of it, and once it will be on the agenda, then I will conceal it from the room to journalists, the Ministry of Defence Martin Bartak, who chose the government just by the democracies.
The first Ministry of Fischer was involved in the next day for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went back to the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time, the ODS would likely vote to the amended budget if it had not explicitly requested the Deputy Deputy to allow the budget vote.
We don't have the feeling of being orphelins, we're not small children, did he respond to the question of whether the ODS had not been rejected by the President of the Partie in the room or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I didn't notice that my vote would be wrong.
I already knew when I rejected my mandate that the following months would be a bunch of the room and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolanek reacted to anyone.
After the new CRD, there will be less training for similar tariffs.

The history of South Africa is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman Alis Mandela
The new Hollywoodien film of Clint Eastwood arrives in the American salaries in the next days, the title is Invictus (the Chec official is Invictus: Neporagened), and reports a part of the life of the old president of South African Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the worldly known apartment was returned to Morgan Freeman, which has been chosen for years ago by Mandela himself to incarcer it.
The second masculin role of the South African champion of Rugby was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in salaries, the returns of critics and publics are hearing.
Nelson Mandela
With his full name Nelson Rolihla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received Sakharov's price for his spirit freedom, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Price of Peace at Klerk's side.
He was President of South Africa in 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is present at a moment when South Africa is completely prepared for the football world, and otherwise because the media are acted by new concerns about the increase of racial conflicts and discriminations of the inhabitants of the black majority to power.
According to the AP Agency, the reactions to the new film are at the moment most positive in South Africa, although the frequency reserved to the main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywoodian stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, receiving his own terms, the honour of the film.
I dream of this role of long years and I'm ready well.
I also felt personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as it says - receiving his energy, he has indicated in the first office of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and the message of Mandela.
This is the history of South Africa's Republic, but it is concerned about each person who has added it.
Port the maillot of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of the British writer John Carlin, the title was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave his creation to the people defenced the South African Defender of Human Rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore trys during the film to collect two racial groups of a long-term population and even as Nelson Mandela in 1995 between the national maillot of South African team on the football of the world, which South Africa had then brought.
In order to be shown on the maillot ball, which is considered in South Africa as a sacred thing, Mandela was long-termly unioned for four years ago, mainly of the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
We hope that the football campaign has successfully joined people again in a single nation, indicated the Rugby Chester Williams player, who was the only "night" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see whether the South African tendue situation will improve.
However, the whites of South African are sceptics as recently trusted in a training for the LN Christopher Dawson, a fan of rugby who went to the Great Britain.
The campaign starts on 11 June 2010.

According to Lucas Marvan, the port-word of Usti bombers, there are six units who operate on the fire.
They counted the origin to allow the transformator to consume, but they revealed their opinion and stressed fire with a water mixture, museum and a special substance.
The cause is a technical failure, an internal circle of the transformator.

Janczura is ported plainly for diffamating against the three prefects of the CSSD
Radim Janczura, owner of Student Agency, will now deposit plainly to divorce against three democratic social prefects.
And particularly against Michal Haschek of the South Moravie region, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesarzyk.
Janczura showed it in twenty minutes from Radiojurnal.
The plaint is linked to the company's trying to explore regional ferry paths in some regions.
However, all regions have been finished by signing long-term contracts with the Chess Forest Roads.
All three attacked us and claimed that we were doing the ends of the mouths, while it was only a offer for what they wanted themselves.
They suggest that we are more loving than the Chess Roads to make what is not true because we know the prices of the Chess Average Roads that have been signed last week.
So it's not more than to defend us.
It's in switch of challenges on the Student Agency society, and Janczura in Radiojurnal.
In addition, he indicated that there were evidence that no region had been processed in accordance with the European law.
We are prepared for this a statement for the European Commission.
Haschek considers that Mr. Janczura's deposit represents the following of his medical spectacle that serves him free publicity for his society and his person.
I'm very ready to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I believe that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is just Mr. Janczura that manipulates public opinion and recalls false and false arguments about regional ferroviary transports, Haskek.
Janczura has already informed the last week that he will invest a few million coroners in a publicity that will refer to the disfavourable events of the regions.
He told Radiojurnal that he interrupts the campaign after Noël and that he considers to take her back after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would show corruption in a wide sense.
Janczura incomed his campaign after the regions were agreed to trust the Chess Forest Roads the operation of ferroviary connections for a command of approximately 150 billion core, without excusing offers.
According to Janczura, such a way to act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
Following him, its crisis of ferroviary transports in the regions has also amended to Janczura the amendments of a CCSSD deputy.
The only threat was that if we wouldn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He has been presented as President of the CSSD, I don't know what he is, but I will not say his name, says Janczura today at Radiozurnal.
Vaccination against pneumococs will be free and facultative
Vaccination against pneumococs will turn the old habits since January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time facultative for families.
The voice is already exalted, saying that an obligation vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against the colling pneumococs.
The pharmaceutic institution already defines the maximum prices that will pay the disease ensures.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccins for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August may be freely vaccinized against pneumococs.
The condition is that they haven't been vaccinated yet.
If we started vaccination last or later, we should pay the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccin must be administrated between the third and the fifth month of the child.
In the last year, a fourth of the families have volunteerly vaccinated their children against pneumococs.
However, parents payed 1600 corners more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists consider that every year disease ensures depend 300 to 450 000 corners in vaccin doses.
However, they economy on medical cares that children who were not vaccinated would need.
The State has expansioned about 500 000 corons per year for the entire vaccination of children.
The refused vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococks are the cause of infections of the middle ear, but also of severe infections such as the inflamations of mines and blood infections.
According to hospital investigations, there were 28 dead children in less than 10 years caused by pneumocock infections.
In part of the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the rebounded vaccination.
Would the vaccination be committed?
There are opinions on an eventual vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by security and facultative.
For example, the President of the Association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovski stated that an obligation vaccination would be more positive.
His association promised vaccination against pneumococs since long.
In an international conference with which our association has participated, the specialists have not been really satisfied by the fact that we have a facultative vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we're happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it's a direction that we need to follow now has stated the Kalovic.
But the Health Ministry does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococs.
We're not absolutely invisible for the moment, he told her portal Vlastimil Srschň.
Facultative vaccination with her inconvenients, in addition to the doctors.
Hana Cabrnoch, President of the Specialised Society of Pediatres, recognizes that a vaccination based on the volontariats.
If all the children were vaccinated, we could be considered a low-down of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccin costs such a sum I understand the decision that makes the facultative vaccination," said Cabrnoch.
The specialists propose that from the next year more than 80 percent of new parents will evacuate their foods.
Vaccination against pneumococks marks a break also because it is the first vaccination of children financed by security and not the State.
Cabrnoch explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, they would also explore future medical care.
The doctors should buy their products themselves
However, this is linked to the subjects of the practical pediatrics, which are concerned with the achievement of vaccins.
The original intention was to buy vaccins by ensure, the doctors received them as the other vaccin products provided by the State.
However, some deputy were afraid that this would ensure that it would "degrade the sums of health insurance".
Thus, the doctors should buy products and wait for ensure that they reward them.
According to the estimations, pediatrics should individually invest about about 400,000 corones per month in vaccins, which is a significant sum.
It's going to be easy, according to Cabrnoch.
The son of a American artist implied in a "Mush Vol"
Frank Frazetta's son, recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to fly tables for a value of $20 million (12 million of GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was interrupted while he was loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and in a remark.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical plot to strengthen the entrance of the museum in the Mount Pocono.
Mr Frazetta Senor, 81 years old, is honorable for his designs of persons such as Conan el Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the accident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press Press Agency.
The AP has cited a police responsibility according to which the young Mr Frazetta may have been motivated by a family desire.
According to a police declaration, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years, suggested that his father has been authorized to "to enter the museum, in any way, to transport the tables into a store installation," the agent reported.
Mr Frazetta Senor has never given such authorisation, said the Agency.
The Labour defends the increase of the budgetary tax.
The Ministers have defenced the increase of the tax and reduction of the expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, unless the criteria of opposition, businesses and syndicates.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" was an opportunity to show that it was serious about the deficit reduction of the deficit by reporting its decisions to the elections.
The Chanceleier also attacked the grounds by attacking the low salaries and medium salaries.
Through its main proposals, a increase of 0.5% of the Social Agency and a deep level of 1% on public payments from 2011.
The wrath of social security
Syndicates protested that the low salaries are penalized by a recipe which they are not responsible and had been held on the basis of "problems".
The reduction of social security-- which allows to obtain about about 3 billion GBP per year - has made the world of enterprises in wrath, because it is a tax on the employment while the objective should be an economy relationship.
The increase, reserved to those who win more than 20,000 GBP per year, will touch about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAUS POINS PRINCIPIAL REPORT PROBUDGET
The social security will increase more than 0,5% from April 2011
Economies will be lower than 4,75% expected this year
New rate of 50% of the banking bodies
The increase of the contribution on the benefits of the company for small society has been abandoned
Radial rates of electric cars and oilways
Increasing retraits of 2.5%
According to Tresor estimations, a 30,000 GBP person will lose 90 GBP per year and a 40,000 GBP person will lose 190 GBP, while a person wins 10,000 GBP per year will win 110 GBP more.
The Ministers declared that their objective to reduce half the deficit before 2013 "with difficult decisions" would be increasing that 60% of the load of additional taxes would be on the first 5% of the salary.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary-General in the Tresor, refused to increase the tax and submitted that a reduction of expenditure was a "water water in the ocean" in relation to what was necessary.
"The numbers are important. They will allow us to divide by two the deficit, which will be absolutely independent in the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would be restarted at the end of the year.
However, the provisions of the Working on Economic growth - which will influence the quantity that it should be employed and the speed in which the deficit will be complicated - were taken doubts after the Chancelier had been committed to review its first numbers.
In his allocation, he stated that the economy would probably be low to 4,75% this year - better than the decline of 3,5 per cent in April - while the impact would be over 3 billion of GDP above the prevalent estimation.
"First Opportunity"
Conservatives who will launch a new public campaign warning against the Labour's "Ded Crisis" have stated that the project of exceeding 789 billion GBP during the next six years was not viable.
The Ministers have not succeeded to present a credible plan on the way to rebuild, they have added to "cynically" of difficult choices until the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They have nothing of significant proposal about what they're going to do," said Philip Hammond, the Secretary-General in the fantastic Cabinet Tresor. "They have had the opportunity to do and they missed it."
" The important announcements will be done after elections, whatever the vendor "
Roger Bootle, Delotte
The Working points out that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the next reductions, in contrast to the Tory proposals that would enhance a faster and more important reduction of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems stated that the money collected by the increased tax and reduction of expenditure would be used to support the expenses of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, supporting that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC Political Representative, stated that the advertising calendar - such as the increase of inflation for certain invalidity offers in April next, the Chancelier would be raised up against propagande accusations, and the money is just reached in the next year.
However, the Labour insists that additional assistance is provided while people have the most need and that the situation will be revealed in September 2010.
"Fails budget"
Although the Ministers had not published the detail of expenses for 2011, the economists stated that it was clear that the restrictions of public expenditure would not be beginning to feel only at the average.
The very respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute of Fiscales) stated that the numbers of Chancelier implied, in the future, sustainable reductions in many areas, including transport, high education, science and defence.
"The pain is just reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be done after the elections, as well as the vendor," added Roger Bootle, Economic Counciller to Deloite accounts.
"This was a false pre-budget report, the markets are well considered."
The FBI investigates the "American Arrestations in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrestation in Pakistan, five American reporters, extremist links.
Mans were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the East Province of Punjab, announced the American embassy in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI stated that he was investigated to know if it was the same men who had been declared lost from their home in Virginia, the last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of America said that he was also looking for information on these persons.
Three of them are presented as a Pakistan ascension, an Egyptian heritage and the other Jemenite origin.
If these are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what accusations are to meet them and in what conditions they are arrested," says Ian Kelly.
Katherine Switzerland, the FBI port-word stated that the Agency had knowledge of arrests and that she was in contact with the families of lost students.
"We will cooperate with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if it is really the students who have been taken away," she said.
The Pakistan embassed in Washington stated that men were arrested in a home apart from one of them.
This said that the house was already overseered by the local police and that no accusation had been brought against the arrested men.
The Secretary-General of State, Hillary Clinton refused any comment on arrests, reported the Reuter Press Agency, but said that the United States should "collecting more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to decline the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and form people."
The five students were taken away from their home by their families in North Virginia, the end of November.
Amnesty condemns the "abus" Iranians
The last twenty years, human rights have been respected as much as ever, according to the report of Amnesty International Association.
The report presents "repeatments of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the Presidential elections of June.
A man in the report stated that he was struck and burned with cigarettes, and another stated that he was violated.
Iran raised the previous criteria on its non-respect of human rights.
The authorities have stated that such critics are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and twice were killed in Iran, after the debated election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public manifestations from the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Douze were condemned to prison penalties, and the prosecutors claim that at least five persons were condemned to death.
Jon Leyne, corresponding to the BBC in Teheran, now in London, states that at the beginning of Protestations, the Supreme Leader, Ayatolah Ali Khamenei, has recognized some of the abuse allégations, ordering the closement of the detention center of Kahrizaq.
But since that time, the authorities have not touched any critical, says our correspondant.
"Fuse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old student, Abraham Mehtari, who had said that he had been accused of "Travailler with Facebook networks" and had protested against the results of the election.
"They have sometimes hit me on the face," he was citated.
"I've been burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the cow, on the head, they've hurt me executing and humbled me."
Five days later, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half knowledge, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate who lost the elections, M. Karrubi, stated that demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were violated.
The Iranian authorities have undertaken violation accusations, but they have agreed that abuses had been located.
Amnesty also quoted the case of an old arrest that said had been closed in a container with 75 other persons, for over eight weeks, in a prison center at Kahrizaq.
Amnesty accepted that the Iran Parliament and the Court of Justice create a committee to investigate post-selected problems and the response of the Government, but she stated that the mandate and powers of these organs were not clear and that the results of the Parliamentary Committee were not made public.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested during the past three weeks, in order to prevent other demonstrations.
Ski tracks built in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site in a track for competitions.
The eventPiste in the Park (Une trace in the park) attacked 16 snowboarders and half-profits in competition for inspection prices.
On the top of the park of Brandon Hill, a small tremplin prevented a track of 100 m long.
John Hickman, student in the fourth year of medicine, stated that the view of the top of the track was beautiful but that it was so impressive.
It's a wonderful view, with all the lights of the city's skinning in contraba.
There are some of the best snows and snow-borders of the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best back - or figures made on the track.
After the Jewish party, the snow will be left to the source.
Always they and us
Islam could be French?
Multialism and Pragmatism in a laick State.
Roger Bootle, Delotte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last work of the author, "For Frances don't love the fould" (2006), an elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country since a fifty years and whose effects are still feeling today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a very larger and more ambitious train.
Good anthropologist, he does not only want to know what the political and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He has passed many months in the muscles, schools and institutions that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "musulman spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well to hear and play the discussions between teachers and students about the most concernful issues.
Does a Muslim have to marry in a muscle or maría (or both)?
Does the evolution and the rights of homosexuality have to be teached to the young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-musulman?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to get a preparation?
This is the practical problems, which are the daily lot, instead of the political drames that care for the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown from the great public, except maybe Tariq Ramadan, a Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on the way to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern laying company.
They're not able to discuss the debate until the bottom.
Conservants do not believe in the idea of a French or European islam.
The intellectual and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally agreed with their lawyers of a Sunni islam purist associated with Saoudi Arabia, which from our days are a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Musulmans and the lacities of the French could be compatible with.
But a compromise can only be obtained with the efforts of each camp.
It is asked how French politicians (and the guarding intellectual election as a virus of laïcity) are really involved against pluralism.
According to him, the Musulmans have not been guaranteed, in relation to the Catholic, the Protestors and the Jews who have also made historical compromises with the laiki republicanism.
Instead of a growing pragmatism, he detects a "etroitity of key values".
Islam may be French? After reading this book, we are trying to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The glass that consists is driving on a alarming speed, bringing with it a life that can't survive otherwise.
The petrole, the gas, the expeditions and the fishing flow in new open waters, with diplomates, lawyers, and now writers in their silence.
In "To a little glass shadow," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, pending a natural story of the great north symbol, the polar ours.
Historical and complied fishing policies in the Baleine, he described the long tradition of the architecture explorators who proved their evidence by disappearing the white weight.
The meeting of Amiral Nelson, then strong aspiring from 14 years who didn't have to fight only the point of his musquet, is certainly a mythe, but the rest is true.
The young musons, captured when they were naked at their mother's side, all just killed, were attacked and sent into zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the 19th century, a festival spectacle gathered 75 us at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually always a million of the surface needed for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar polar wealth in Singapore has become green because of algebras that were able to put in its area.

Mr. Ellis tells the history of other writers and historicals and often turns on the threat that the challengers constitute on the survival of species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killers continue to Greenland and Canada where helicopters and the Indians in Motoski use powerful fusils to escape their grounds.
Ironically, it's in the most north of these two nations of the ship that the ice will remain the longest time.
In his new book, "After the glass," Alun Anderson, an old editor in New Scientist, offers a clear and effort of the science of the Architecture and a presence of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Atmospheres or oceanographs can not relate exactly to the speed of changes.
It's not a mistake to try.
Fin 19th and beginning XXeme, Fridtjof Nansen pioneer travels gave the first information on the source of the glass.
The submarines of the cold war have then cartographed the changes of refugee.
Satellite monitors and sounds on icebergs are a great help, but the biggest of the work is made by indulgent men, camping in the fridge.
Mr. Anderson contemporates the extraordinary and small world of the architecture ice system, formed by the smooth waters pressed by glass.
But from above the wonders of microscopes contained in the glass, everything will be lost with the loss of the age glass, provided between 2013 and 2050.

Marines, among 6 000 people who put corners on the graves in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, made a travel of seven hours in bus to put a simple corner on the grave of a soldier that he never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the travel of Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, in North Caroline to the Arlington National Cemetery Cimetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to sale men and women who, one day, were at their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we risk to be in their place, Robinson said about soldiers caught.
If that happens to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me. That's why I just try to show respect.
It was one of the 6 000 volunteers to be gathered tomorrow to put corones on the graves of veterans, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony cimeter.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, in Maine, started the memoration and other people decided to discourage several hundreds of tombs in Arlington Ceremony cimeter.
Now, in order to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the travel every year, staying in different cities on their way, to organize memories in the honor of military and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also found a non-profit objective, Wreaths Across America (American corees), which has to promote the event in all other States.
This year, the volunteers placed over 16,000 corones on the tops of Arlington, around Pentagone, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memory site for the victims of the United Airlines at Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Wallmart Foundation foundation gave more than $1500,000 to buy and transport the corees.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, stated that she had made the travel to Arlington in the honor of her husband, a decade carrier military.
Although her husband didn't be buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this jeast was a way to thank those who were victims.
It's a little geste that can make civilians to support our teams, she said.
It's like to visit a family grave.
Emited in several hot clothing layers, volunteers have marked between the pools and the extent collines of the cimeter.
Volunteers have chosen old tombs, given from the First and Second World War, as well as from Vietnam’s War, because these are not often visited only the new graves.
The humor was in optimism, while the children played and couples stayed by the hand, bringing the brass corners on the green graves.
Each round corner had a green red color, with a little red red pavillon on the top.
At least, the silence was planned on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhuman.
The United Service Organizations gave 1 000 corners to decorate the section, but the dark humor of the current war was involving the area.
People weeped without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the frozen air.
Some read a loud voice the names recorded in the stone while others were cut down to see the small black and white information cards, grounded in the humble earth for those who had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in lame, on the grave of his son.
She is part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and had led eight hours to come to gather on the sepulchre of the Sergent of GunneryDavid Shane Spicer in July.
Nobody should forget that we are free... my son paid for that, she said.
"A long time after I lost, I want someone to remember him."
A American resident arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government decided an American resident who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, reported the United States Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
The resident, which has not yet been identified, works for alternative developments Inc., based on Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consultative authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana tried to have access to the detention held on 5 December.
Certain accusations were not made public, although under the Cuban law, a cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be stopped under the pretext of being "dengerious".
All activities that have been revolutionary, including moderate protests and critical writes, lead to the risk of a arrest.
Anti-governmental graffitis and talks are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of more larger and larger bloggers, carried out by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentary that often wrote on how they are married and followed by the government agents.
Sanchez has made several requests to leave the country to get rewards, but the authorisations have always been rejected.
The detention of an American resident may increase the tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues a "douce" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arestation was first reported by the New York Times, Friday.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban Government progresses by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the United States may make the same.
Mobile phones and portable computers are authorised to Cuba, although new and desired consumption benefits in a country or the average payment of a officer is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government gave regular citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or a conversation of 15 minutes corresponding to a payment day.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to connect to the government should communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of a American in Cuba is weird.
Most of the American rare incarcered in Cuba are the barals behind crimes such as drug traffic, Gloria Berbena, attached to the US Interests Section in La Havana.
Berbena said that she couldn't provide more information about the restriction.
Arrestation and detention are a great mistake.
A activities that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- distributing freely mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the United Nations Human Rights Watch Group, which recently published a serious report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", which refers to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick brother.
According to Vivanco, an accusation is often arrested, past in court and undertaken on the same day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often provides a negative reaction in the United States, while both countries begin to promote a better dialogue.
Pakistan authorities require a contract to send men to Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistan authorities have repeated a supply organization to prepare a complot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American groups, saying that this case would allow a major network of terrorist recruiters that only searched for the Internet for racialized young men.
Researchers told them that they lost a hidden insurgent personality, known under the name of Saifulah, who invited these men to Pakistan after they discovered them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist vagues on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
At the arrival to Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifulah who tried to help them to join the region recovered from Pakistan tribal ceinture, from Al-Qaida and from its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistan Secret Services that had been informed of the case said saifulah had not succeeded to convince the Al-Qaida Commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA's complot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
In fact, they were isolated for days in the east city of Sargodha, far from the formal mountains from the northern is become a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they have been rejected, a representative of the authorities who expressed the conditions of maintaining anonymity because of the confidential character of the business.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to get the necessary authorisations to get into the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Taiwan law forces.
The case of those five men, who remain in Pakistan and are asked by the FBI, is initiated on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and may be more important in the definition of persons in which they trust.
Since the attention of 11 September 2001, American secret services have been priority to import men into the al-Qaida network.
The organisation's recruiters play the role of guarantees, refusing the entrance to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can be springs.
According to the analysis, potential American recrutes are studied closely by Al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert of the NEFA Foundation based on the United States, stated that the terrorist groups should also be more attention, these last years in the choice of the persons they accept because American secret services were experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to import someone in these groups, what better way to follow his recruitment model as many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one who is more on the Internet.
Thursdays of thousands of protestants in Copenhague ask a "action" for climate
Thirds of thousands of protestants have passed in the streets, here, sabate, requesting more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated to 100 000 people, at least 25 000, according to the policy estimations.
This event has been related to peacefully discovered, although a small number of massive activists have raised a few explosives near a total of government buildings in the center town.
The day when a few things have happened during the United Nations sponsorized climate discussions, thousands of activists have marked from the city, developing pancarts in English, saying, "It does not exist of planet B" and one in Spanish, says "The Earth says that it is enough."
Many celebrations have been joined to protestations, including the top model and the Danish photograph, Helena Christensen, who has stated that to travel to his mother's birth country, the Peru, opened his eyes on the desirant problems in which the country has to face because of the impact of climate changes that have already been produced."
It is one of the reasons I decided to join the great road -- to pass the word and to call the leaders of the whole world to take righteous, ambitious and engaged decisions, she said.
This is not a easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is not more possible to escape it.
The police refused the manifestants to come too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people for the motive that they brought a mask or they were in possession of pockets.
The police refused the manifestants to come too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people for the motive that they brought a mask or they were in possession of pockets.
According to a passman who requested to maintain anonymity because of its implication in climate discussions, the activities that carried up masks and black clothes have raised several explosives near the main channel of Copenhague who is around some ministries.
They leaving them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were all the first of the fuses, then followed by "what big explosions."
In the House of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the travel, at the next day.
But it seems that the demonstrators had not succeeded to reveal the conscience of the key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When we asked him whether a manifestation had a positive impact on international deliverations, he answered in English, "In fact, it was something I didn't have conscious.
Then he continued in Mandarin, saying, "The event is important, I can't hear what is happening outside."
He observed that the market could seem negative or useful according to the perspectives.
She shows the interest of the great public and various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "You can also say that they suffer the negotiations, or that they threaten the freedom of others."
The results of tests reveals teenagers between races
The federal report of the last week on mathematical results has brought a good news for the public schools of Washington D.C.
Although the District remains still far behind the heading institutions, the report shows that Grad 4 and Grad 5 (cm1-cm2) are very greater progress in the two years ago than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, the recent numbers of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Evaluation of Learning Progress) is the excessive exchange between the results of Africans and Whites, on local and national plans.
The average results of the white children of Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington D.C. have increased, in the past two years, from 262 to 270 (for a scale of 500), but those of their African class companies have only increased from three points from 209 to 212.
The achievement of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, exceeding 53 to 58 points.
The progress of Africans in grade 8 (4th) remains generally constantly, just a point of 245 to 244.
The average result of whites was not included in the test results because the example was not enough important.
The total view of a period of six years is not more encouraged.
In 2003, the excursion between black and white class of grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results received by children in the two groups have increased during this period, the differences only have been reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed the concern that the highness held by the Director of Michelle A. Rhee and Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate) had been propulsed by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have highlighted the agreement with regard to the elements above the scale, what is problem and generous, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. This is a non-profit group that defends equality in the District education.
I don't have a joy for one or two wind points, Kwame R. Brown (aspected democratic), member of the Council of D.C. and whose girl is in Grade 4, in Eaton Elementary (It's elementary school).
Often critical of the Rhee management style, Brown stated that the message of test results is that the middle schools (coles) of the city needed unexpected attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what makes fear is that we don't save enough time and energy in our middle schools (coles).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficult.
This automobile, for example, some teachers have been formed to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, regarding the school schools of the elementary cycle, and the start of college that have not integrated the reading bases in their school parks and which are sufficiently late with their companies.
Each day, the mathematics program for childrengarten classs (material) at Grade 6 (6th) sets the accent on games and experiences of real life, such as they have been placed in the old District by the responsible Clifford Janey, which also must be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue to work to provide better interventions to these students low-level students, says Rhee.
Others consider that the results of the NAEP may know if Rhee can continue to raise the general results of the system by providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the excursion.
It's a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher for the Berkeley University in California, who studys the results of the town tests.
Conventional political solution is to save your resources and management reforms in schools located in the poorest rooms of Washington.
Therefore, this target may have political impacts that guarantee this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other Superintendent of schools, she trys to use the average white and black class.
We concentrate to ensure the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our quarters schools so that all families, where they are originating, may be sure that their children can get a great public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark schools, stated in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success of the traditional public school, today of 180 days in Washington District, to be competent with Charter Schools.
We need to get about 200 days to have the strength to change, says Janey, who has come to a agreement with his teachers' syndicate last year to get 185 days, that he consists of a "department point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long ciffle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, down and climb a moment of the eyes at the view of the white columns, balls and green pools.
Graciela's parents could only finish the school in El Salvador.
Before recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never put his feet on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other students of the group were exploring Gettysburg where school prices were $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than the new impressed student than enhusiast.
Super Here I'm going to study! Graciela called Graciela who would want to study the medicine, while the guidance leads them to the input of science building.
Youpi, really? She said a dream, when we indicate him the low teacher of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh who visited children during their trip to discover three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: The question is not to know if you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still wide for the number of American children who were born of Spanish immigrated parents who have left the school where they were parents in the age, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit the university education that allows them to enter into the middle class.
In fact, "the Spanish of the Second Generation" on five-poursuit studies in the school -- a notable success if it is considered as much of their immigrated parents, most of the Mexico or Central America, entered into the United States without finishing the school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to the following generations that will play a important role in the hand of the country's work.
Researchers who train the battery claim that these are a natural affinity with school and a need to succeed.
Many are also those who make their parents high objectives and find ways to compensate their failure with American schools.
The mental programmes also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as it comes to the university -- particularly if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low families with parents who do not have experience and competences to help them to ship in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gandara, researcher to Davis, California University, who studied Latin-American students.
We need to think that we offer a network of support for these children from the maternal to school.
The federal programme financed the visit of the University of Graciela is a good example.
In the name of GEAR UP (preparing you), he provides more than 300 million dollars per year to local school systems to organize preparation programmes to university who start when students of low income families are in the middle school (cole) and continue to the end of the years of school.
Since 1999, the programme was followed more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the United States Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi petrolio has agreements with 10 foreign petrolio society
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraq Government has succeeded to attach important petroliar society to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two weekends.
The 10 agreements achieved by the Minister of Iraq with foreign petrolic society suggest that China, Russia and Europe are on the point of playing a major role in Iraq's state of petrolium industry, invalided by ten years of war and sanctions.
America's society are divided with a participation in only two of the 10 fields in the areas.
Seven American society had paid to participate in the second age that started Friday.
The only one who had put a piece was lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for fields held in June.
The low representation of American petroliers in the opening of the petrolier sector in Iraq surprised the analysis.
Iraq finally opened his doors, after six years of war, and instead of American society, they are Asian and European society opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum Iraq Oil Forum, a website of information on the Internet.
It will need a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns on security, corrupted by massive, mardi-coordinated bombards, and political instability, while the American military teams were departed from the American petrolear society, refusing to enter with more force in Iraq who had the third largest storage of brute petrole in the world, says the analyticals.
In some cases, the American society was disappeared because of their rivers, in particular the Chinese and other energy society controlled by a government, which was increasingly less and which were prepared to take risks because they did not take account of actions.
Exxon-Mobile and West Petroleum Inc. were the only American society to get contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American society, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained strong links with the Minister of Iraqi petrole and have brought him their technical advice, are distributed by the empty hands.
The Russian society Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main actions in two of the contracts assigned this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has increased contracts than other companies and is divided with important participations in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is in the way to become a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, the port-word of the Ministry of Petrole.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit income offers that later were compared to the tariff by baril that the Ministry was to make agreement to motivate the production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main Al-Qaida organizators would be killed in Pakistan
It seems that a American missile, with a long front with Afghanistan, killed one of the Al-Qaida operators, this week, had stated the United States Anti-Spionage Authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders of this car.
Saleh al-Sumali was one of the two Arab men who were surprised to have been killed by a couple of missiles launched in their car, March, near Miran Shah City in North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistan authorities in the region.
The local authorities stated that the missiles were shooted by a type pilot used by the CIA, within the anarchical tribal border of Pakistan.
They led a white car, directing to the African border, when the car was broken, a member of the Pakistan citizens secret services, expressing the Miran Shah phone.
The representatives of the Authority declared that the local suspected militarys were precipitated and rapidly convinced what remained from the "entirely dismissed body".
It was totally impossible to the local authorities to check the identity of victims, but the two American anti-terrorists gave unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the responsible military organizators of Al-Qaida who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize complots throughout the world, and one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymate, quoting the sensitive nature of aircraft inside the Pakistan territory.
Since its central role, it was probably understood the conspirations of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic consigns of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them to action plans for events of terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States authorities stated that Somali had progressed quickly in the Al-Qaida ranges and had a very good relationship with other extremist groups in the region.
Maybe it is not known of the great American public, but it does not reduce the threat that he constitutes for us and our associates, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important person of Al-Qaida or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack was killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a military action in the tribal ceinture, and three other operators.
The rhythm of attacks made by the CIA drones decreased since the age, about six operations per month to two, according to the numbers of the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, even by killing the subsequently submitted information, to report the site.
The United Nations special sentence to Kaboul is removed
The Special Mission of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, declared Friday that he wanted to demission his position in March, at the end of a tuberculous mandate involving corruption allégations extended during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The Department of Eida is involved when Obama's administration decided to send 30 000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations sentence said that he supported this increase, but he expressed his concern on the United States calendar for a retreat of groups that would begin in 18 months and that would obtain other OTAN governments to remove their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to Afghans and remind them that they may have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a phone support of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assistance to the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was not demissioned but that he would just respect the commitment he had taken to his family in March, just two years to Kaboul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacer.
I just said he was better to find my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month empty between my presidency and my presidency.
According to the United Nations representatives, Ban has already started to search for a replacement.
The representatives believe that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a town of Italo-Swiss, which recently predicted a mission of the United Nations in Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a France who led the United Nations peacekeeping operations before.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was made at the test after his old advice, Peter W. Galbraith, accused, in September, to favore President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to discumb the evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide has nicked these allégations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which has been thanked -- "the mission has been prejudiced because there has already been a good dose of scepticism in respect of the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the nomination of a civil representative to coordinate American forces in Afghanistan.
He also encouraged the United Nations responsibilities to allow his follow-up to build more personnel from the United States and other west countries which are not assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would allow them to give more confidence on how their money is paid.
Eide expressed its frustration on the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the serious UN regulations had its opportunities to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are like I could only recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't stay.
Gates: Iran needs to get additional sanctions
The Secretary-General to the Defence, Robert Gates stated Friday that the major world powers would immediately impose "important sanctions" on Iran because of his incapacity to income in nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressed before a party of 300 American soldiers north of Iraq, during a week visit in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramaticized the event of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, in response to the question of a soldier on the event of such denounce.’
One of the most fairly things I have learned in Iraq during the past six years, is the invisible side inherent to the war.
Obama administration consists of a total of sanctions showing the military and political election of Iran, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians of the street.
He stated that a "all motivations and punctions" could be necessary to persecute the Iran Government that it would be in fact less safe with nuclear weapons ' because "the people of his people would suffer greatly of those sanctions.
Vendredi, in a declaration of the white house, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not return its nuclear programme in total conformity with the United Nations Security Council and its Survey Board, the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop his nuclear experience only in a peaceful goal.
In Geneva's parliamentary, on 1 October, he indicated that he would renew the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and accepted to discharge a major part of his enrich urinium storage, by switching disappearable carburant for a medical research reactor.
The administration has established such a agreement to develop confidence of both sides and to win time for negotiations.
Since Iran appeared to be far from the agreement trials - partly, the experts say, because Iran leadership is divided on the fact of toggle or not with the United States.
Francely, Ireland's railment in view of some of the proposals of the international community for which they actually had given their agreement at the beginning of October, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, had to join themselves on what they had not considered, in accordance with important sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama fixed on 31 December as a date limited to Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including the consequence of the Secretary-General of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "great sanctions".
In a Jewish statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations declared that it calls "unbased allégations" of certain members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran and stated that it was agreed to continue to speak with the United States and five other major world powers, "to get a long-term solution."
Gates, who had to return to Washington after Friday, met the morning, the Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki, before to take the air for the rich farmer region of Kurdish to meet the responsible groups in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are tensions between Kurdes and the Arab majority in Iraq, especially on borders, property rights and income share.
Gates urged the two parts to reduce the potential conflict in order to escape all late American plans for reduction of the number of American groups, from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also want to calm down the accuracy of the Kurdes on the resistance. The United States authorities cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will keep your security, your property and your autonomy in the unified Iraq."
We're not gonna leave you."
In ancient China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and his husband have grown around propagands, saying, "The Mother Earth is too happy to buy more children" and "A baby in more, it's a grave in more."
They have learned that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient rate of naturality of their city and the older population, have rarely changed the direction of this year and have started encouraged young couples to have more than a child; their reaction has been instantly and closed: never.
We have already given our whole time and all our energy to a single child.
We have no second, said Wang, 31 years, Director of Human Resources, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the unique child's policy in China, creating two unique generations with good games and guarantees, named "the emperors" crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birthrate has fallen from 1,8 children per couple in relation to six when the policy has been implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents of 60 years and more explosive residents, was 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This number is well over the global average of 20 per cent.
This deal is still worse in the rich coast cities with a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
The last year, people of 60 years and more represented about 22 percent of the population of residents recorded in Shanghai, while the birthrate was less than a couple child.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Municipale Population of Shanghai and the Family Planning) stated that the fertile couples should have children to "aid to reduce the proportion of the old population and to prevent a missing work in the future."
Shanghai is on the point of being "so old - but not too rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" said.
Progressive attention
In the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the unique child is in this day, without contrast, the most controversy obligation introduced by the communist government.
The couples who transgress this policy are risked to pay colossal amendments -- to three times their annual income -- and to make a discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have contributed to the police to help the country to avoid dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers of human rights have denied the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the Authority have forced a second child to adhere.
Moreover, many couples have reviewed the electoral advantages that lead to a ratio of kids - girls often high.
The last years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the unique child.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for the residents of the cities, the members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they have adopted many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, teacher of the Institute of Population Research (Public Research Institute), in Pekin University, stated that the authorities of the Central Government have recently discussed more rare changes, such as to allow couples to have two children if one of the partners is a unique child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch a aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters who encourage the families to have only one child have been replaced by detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to make the authorisation request.
The Government of the town has rejected the responsibilities of family planning and volunteers to meet couples, to their household, and to spread prospects under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the responsibility of family planning, the response was declined.
Received response
Although the responsibilities in a rural town of Shanghai Bank say that they have seen a increase in the requests of couples, who wanted a second child after the launch of the campaign, the most urban district reported that there was no change.
The community of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 people, for example, receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai's responsibilities, declared that, although the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is always prevented to be only about 165 000 -- less than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for the family planning committee in the Shanghai community, stated that financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want to have children.
They want to be their first child, did she say?
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would worship two children and that they are legally authorized.
But as many Chinese, they only have the minimum health security and the live security given by the government.
Without social protection, they say that the decision would be irresponsible.
The westerns believe that the policy of the unique child is a problem of rights, Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is born seven months of the first couple's first child.
That's true, we're going to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their heritage.
Wang, responsible for human resources, said that she wouldn't just want a single child because she was one of herself. "We were the family's centre and we had the usually that everyone was busy about us."
We don't have the way to take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Sieian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more cruel.
For the couples working to two, a average class, which decreases the rate of birth, he says, it must be egal to succeed.
The 20-30-year-old people have grown by seeing their parents fighting in the first time of China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this style of life, he says.
Even a only child asks a lot of time for his parents, he said.
A mother must leave at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he said.
We don't want to do so much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has projects to reduce emissions
The conference on the climate sponsorized by the United Nations -- characterized until now by disorganized impacts and mutual recriminations -- has been returned under the fire of the Vendredi ramp, due to the publication of a document that submits the ambitional reductions of gas-reductions in effect during the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that spread the most of the charges in the next time.
The text that could provide the bases of a final political agreement to regulate the gass of the gass of seriously, has sublined the remaining obstacles, as he has expressed the way to take.
But it was seen as an important advance in negotiations that are missing time, with more than 100 leaders of the world at the next week in Copenhague.
A United Nations Special Working Group, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to support climate refrigeration, current and long-term.
It offers a large gamma of options for key issues, including the way developed economys and new economys could reduce their carbon production and which would be the higher limit of global temperature that the responsibilities would be ready to touch.
He gives a great flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, representing a Washington of Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, which edited six pages of the document, studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the full image".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industry countries would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, 25 to 45 per cent in relation to the levels of 1990, while the principal developing countries would reduce their 15 to 30 per cent.
In together, countries would reduce the emissions between 50 and 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also renewed negotiations, Friday, promised to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poor countries to adapt to the impact of climate changes -- to support inondations and security or to devote desolation.
However, Friday, the same verbal alterations have been produced, which have dominated negotiations since the last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the United States to climate negotiation, rejected all discussions that decline the reduction of gas in effect by industrialized countries, compared voluntary efforts made by the major economys, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration has become more hard to China than Bush's administration has been, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the main developing countries, says Star, which also agreed that the text is not sufficient to ensure that reductions may be checked by external observators.
Stern made his comments a hour after the Chinese Vice- Ministry of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei stated that the main American negotiator, or not "boy sense", was "extremely irresponsible" to have said in the week that the United States would not help China financially to fight the climate refrigeration.
With the future economic trajectors of the main world powers in the game, failures have appeared during the third month and between the industry and the economies.
The current war is more about the saving of individual economy than the saving of the planet, with China and the United States who want their respective obligations, while the poor nations insist on the fact that the two of the most influent countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more stronger.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegated of Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the major powers were struggling to know who should take up the costs of the gas reduction of the effect of seriousness, even though vulnerable countries had become more agressive in their trying to make the great efforts responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegenium is developed, says Ulate, which is also advising the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these most vulnerable countries in the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to pressure in order to obtain a legal treaty, in Copenhague, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a political agreement.
The Assembly of the Small Insulary States, together with 43 members, has adopted a proposal for 24 pages, early in the morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Chief of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of small island States has "mised a political pressure on the full political process" in particular that they are now unified and that they ask the emmergent economics such as China and India to act.
The debates became urgent, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve the majority of the problems in instance before government leaders arrive to a agreement.
High-level responsibilities such as the Ministry of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Ministry have come down from their aircraft and have been held in the Bella Center building to assist home-close meetings and information conferences, in order to make reclamations that will be studied during the next week.
The real image of the collection -- during which 13,000 people enter and go out of the Congress Palace every day -- a gitary active player player presents night spectacles that move from countries that follow them, and that proposals are edited and distributed on the paper instead of e-mails -- constitutes a real deficit.
Intensity is only increased: almost all important ministers are here and not later than Friday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhague.
We enter into the court of the great, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the World Conservation Policy.
The pains are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome of the Sunday
At 5h13, morning morning, a sifflet cup will perceive the night to notify the department of a train that will mark a transport revolution to Great Britain.
The first bathroom train of the country will be 225 km/h, while it's file from Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transports, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes at the first javelin bathroom train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow the United Kingdom to integrate an international network of fast and faithful training and to attach the great competitions of Midlands, North and Ecosy in London.
The small lost branches will become flowering towns, the periods of business traveling will be less long and the airport and the car train will reduce the national carbon emissions by reducing the embouts on the roads.
In the theory, the three major political parties apply to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new ferrored network, the inevitable planning battle and the dangerous fears for the environment are risked to browse the lines in large speed.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to realize a failability report to the Government will give his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This allows him to get a detailed card from the next step for the large speed network.
The new line relating to London to West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the city area and sites where the impact on the environment can be discussed.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters of the final energy.
It is also provided that HS2 provides three options for a larger faster network, going to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer the presemps.
The privileged options are set before in a Y configuration for which a large speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two or near Birmingham, with a branch that goes to the east of Pennys in Manchester and the Ecosse and another to the north east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
One single line will be through the Ecosse.
"It seems that it's the best performance option," said a professional of the rail.
When this is finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all travel passengers between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, in relation to a journey at a time.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400 km/h, bringing the most fastest world network.
The initial trace is designed to allow trains of 400 m long and can transport 1100 people.
Before 18 trains per hour can work on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that could buy 20000 passors per hour would be necessary.
By data of space contracts, it is determined that an existing gas will be increased to receive the large speed network.
Experts of the rain industry say that only St. Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks or not that the project should be placed, but more longer public consultations and planning procedures means that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launchs the machine, the network should be built part of the part.
The trains will first be obligated to shoot out of large speed lines on the existing rails in the north of Birmingham, keeping travel periods between London and the Ecosse up to three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a train train transition, constituting a reference point for the rain revolution.
The contributions pay the price of 75,000 GBP for the Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid to the contribution of thousands of books per year to rebuild the cost of an orangery that he built in his home of his circumscription.
The party responsible for David Cameron to be clear that the members of the Parliament were "contained", increased its employment of 75,000 GBP to build an extension in his second house in Rutland.
It was authorised to pay additional interests, amounting to hundreds of books per month to contribute.
The Commons authorities received the statements at this time and did not have been asked by Sir Thomas Leg, which carried out a control of the expenditures of members. Last night, Mr Duncan stated that the claims could not be "closure or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the most rich members of the Parliament, is owner of a house to two stages in a village of its circumscription of Rutland - Melton.
Avoiding houses were sold for a million books.
The de-closed ice includes a cuisine, a room and a room to eat, but the office of emergency indicates that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, described it in his plans as an orangerail.
The neighbors describe it as a "verranda for pleasure."
Mr Duncan was not requested to give an explanation for the increase of impact during a recent investigation made by the Committee of Privileges and Standards of Commons on its provisions of primary impact.
The Committee announced it in the last month of all non-respects of rules after an investigation on its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the end of 271.406 GBP of his ownership from London to the house of his circumscription that he acquired in 1991, the year before being a member of the Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan called about 1.400 GBP for months of interest to March of the last year.
In April, its requests increased more than 1.800 GBP per month.
The rate of interest on Mr. Duncan's RBS empire has not been changed at this time, suggesting that all increases had to finance the impact of 75,000 GBP.
The normal RBS standard interest rate has passed from 7,94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without movement since the time.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request 1.250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his chairman responsible position in September, after a journalist under the coverage, he had been filmed, saying that the members of the Parliament should survive after the scanning of the expenditure.
"In fact, it's now national, you must live "for budget" and you're being treated as "M...e"
He said, "I spend my money on my garden and asked a small part based on what was right.
And I could ask more sacredly, but I didn't do it."
The member of the Parliament, from his old position, began to explain its expenditure in May, after he appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before he agreed with the cost office that it would be "reasoned as excessive."
A activity has broken a bridge in the bridge of Mr. Duncan, to protect after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
In the last night, Mr Duncan asked about the increase of the empirunt, "It was for capital improvements, approved once by the cost office and by Law."
He added: "It's no problem for derobation or development or use of rules or whatever it is.
It was very clear, in rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be cleaner or simpler."
Friends, come to see the Calendar of the Brighton Avenue
Brighton's field boxes found a new promotion method for the months of hiver, an interactive Avent calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church who encourages spiritual explosion by creativity, invited 24 owners to depart their cabin for each December, using as the theme, Noel's songs.
The event started on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 1730 to 18h30, every day, with feasts and hot wine freely serving.
The songs of Noel chosen until now include "I saw three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël" for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a marketing TV assistant of Hove, is an unrecommended priest from Chichester's dioses and Director of Beyond.
He said, "We want the religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"In as the church, why are we waiting for people entering into a strange old building? I think the church should approach people and celebrate more captively.
"The idea of the Avenue of the field box has come just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a so creative and creative place, and we are trying to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Forte mobilisation in Copenhague and in the world for climate
Thinks of thousands of people have shown the Sabbath to proclaim an ambitious agreement and against the fight against climate revoking, throughout the world and Copenhague, where the police has processed a number of hundreds of interpellations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand people according to the organizators, have been deployed in the flat in the Danish capital, in margins of the United Nations Conference on climate, carried out of here to an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the climate conference, the growing mobilisation on climate throughout the world, which is explained by these demonstrations, contributed to make the "the political price" of a very higher failure in Copenhague.
Incidents in the Danish capital were produced shortly after the department of the Cortege, when a group of 300 manifestants, full of black clothed, broke vitrines with balls and marthals, constated a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-emotive polices are immediately intervented without measure.
In general, the police announced the interpelleration of 600 to 700 persons, essentially according to the members of the "Blacks Blocs", these ultraviolet groups who were particularly expressed to the OTAN in Strasbourg, in the east France, in April.
Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organisations of the demonstration, declared the conditions in which hundreds of militants were interpreted "unlike distinction", submitting that a hundred of them "which were always held in the samedian street "beat and maintained in the position of the extreme frog."
Parts of the Parliament, the cortege, at least a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The manifestants stopped about 500 meters around the building, without looking for penetrate.
A scene was dressed to accommodate the proposed speakers, before a watching to the chairs with the participation of the ancient South African architecture of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the manifestants came in because and trained large towns of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also presented as well as Africans.
Before 3000 people, for most of them in imperfect blue sky, had formed a first conference in Copenhague in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who heard forming "Blue maries" for the "Climate Justice".
Today, we are going down to the streets to ask for the reparation of the ecological deal for South, Lidy Nacpil, a military Phillipin of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhague.
We can't continue to say: We have a time, we appreciated the blessing song Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers sitting in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we never had done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative worldly movement has been close to environmental organizations.
The French deputy Joseph Bové, figure of the Altermondialism, explained that he was come to Copenhague to read climate justice and social justice: "Today, there is no fight against climate refusation and fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens most of the islands particularly vulnerable to the recovery, had given the sentence of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizators, were descended into the streets in Australia.
In Manille, some hundreds of people, students for most, have broken in red, broken bands with solemn energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a number of hundreds of demonstrators have also been held to revoke an energy action against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network gathered several hundreds of people, including in Paris, Marseille (sud), Lille (nord), Bordeaux (east) and Lyon (est).
In Geneva some decades of people were gathered together.
Abkhazia separately chose his President, Georgia denied a "farce"
Abkhazia chose his President samedi, a little more than one year after the reconnaissance of Moscow in this pro-russy region of Georgia, while Tbilissi denied a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first scrutin after the Russian Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of the South Ossety, another Georgian Sexenist territory recognized by Russia.
The vote offices closed at 17H00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closement, according to the responsibilities of the electoral Commission Abkhaze.
The first provisional results should be announced on Sunday evening.
The five candidates, among whom the President came out, Serguei Bagapch, denied the idea of meeting with Georgia, who condemned the treatment of the scrutin.
These choices are a farce.
On his side, President Georgian, Mikheil Saakachvili, "regarded that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his door-word, Manjana Manjgaladze.
Furthermore, Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela recognized the independentness of this territory of 216,000 residents, while the rest of the world consists of him as a part of Georgia, illegally occupied by Russian groups.
After being separated from Georgia in the conflict of 1992-1993, which has made several thousands of deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that she is prepared to join the international community.
This process is a step of our new life, our new age as an independent state, stated to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a historian of 54 years old, which has stated that he voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who came to the vote office in a school of Sokhoumi, capital, in a white building with some palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is in the heart of the presidential in this region in the lowlands, at the front of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch at the side of the President and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Poutine are installed a little part in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the captain of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a calamity at the Russian responsible to monitor the scrutin disruption.
We, the refrained people, are grateful, said in a small ceremony, in allusion of the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independentness of Abkhazi.
I hope that your country will immediately be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, with a vodka branch.
On his side, the opposition represented by the old Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements concluded with Moscow in the past year, such as the Russian ceiling control on the roads of abortion for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, will not support the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% more vote is needed to bring the election.
If no candidate waits for this board, a second tour should be organized in two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, accidents in Copenhague
Thirds of thousands of people have marketed samedi in the world to proclaim an ambitious and contrary agreement to the Conference on the Climate of Copenhague, where the police, on whose life, interpreted about 700 people in march of an immense demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousands of thousands according to the organizators, have deployed the next day in the Danish capital, which is achieved until 18 December 193, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parts of the Parliament, the cortege, globally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations are disappeared.
The manifestants stopped about 500 meters around the center, without looking for penetrate.
A scene was dressed to accommodate the proposed speakers, before a watching to the chairs with the participation of the ancient South African architecture of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A group of hundreds of manifestants, full of black clothes, smokes and marthals, broke vitrines, has been a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-mimetic polices have immediately explored them and have been interacted without mixed, carried out many of them to the ground.
The police announced the interployment of 600 to 700 people, particularly that it was members of "Blacks Blocks", these ultraviolet groups who were particularly illustrated to the OTAN in Strasbourg, in the east France, in April.
At the end of the midnight, a policeman was struck on the mask by a pool and four cars burned near a squat in accidents who led to interply a twenty-five people, according to the police.
We have the extremist groups in the eye, prevented the police's doorwhat, Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces turned into the sky.
The majority of the manifestants, who came in and tracked from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present and Africans.
Before 3000 people, for most of them in imperfect blue sky, had formed a first conference in Copenhague in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who heard forming "Blue maries" for the "Climate Justice".
Today, we are going down to the streets to ask for the reparation of the ecological deal for South, Lidy Nacpil, a military Phillipin of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhague.
We can't continue to say: We have a time, we appreciated the blessing song Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers sitting in Africa, there are water courses where we can walk while we never did it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative worldly movement has been close to environmental organizations.
The French deputy Joseph Bové, figure of the Altermondialism, declared to the AFP to come to Copenhague to read climate justice and social justice: "Today there is no fight against climate refusation and fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including the Danish Mannequin Helena Christensen, ancient Commissioner of the United Nations to the refugees Mary Robinson, who should be addressed to the people.
The Asia-Pacific region, which opens most of the islands particularly vulnerable to the recovery, had given the sentence of demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizators, were descended into the streets in Australia.
In Manille, some hundreds of people, students for most, have demonstrated, red clothes, and wooden bands that achieve the sun energy before the ship of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, collections of some hundreds of manifestants have also been held to reveal a action against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network gathered several hundreds of people, including in Paris, Marseille (sud), Lille (nord), Bordeaux (east) and Lyon (est).
In Geneva some decades of people were gathered together.
The story-geo exit strengthened from the reform of the general school, according to Chatel
The Ministry of the National Education of Luc Chatel declared in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that the history and the geography were "forwarded" from the reform of the general school, although their obligational teaching in a scientific terminal.
The first students will then have the same programme for a common culture, Mr. Chatel.
For the Ministry, "We need to go out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the girl S is no more a scientist philary" but "in big, it's concentrating the best students."
The ES and L are not able to remain sub-filmers of the S, still underlined: "I haven't heard many historics and intellectually increasing the absence of the story-geography in the technological schools."
Saturday, an Effop sonage in the Humanity declared that nearly seven Frances over 10 (69%) have not approved the government project to remove the obligative education of the history of the terminal-geography in S. Many intellectual and teachers have criticized this elimination, as well as the left and some right choices.
The Ministry added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of the terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defend the reform of teachers' training, while 16 organizations (students and syndicates) have called for a marginal mobilisation day to protect the project, which offers the phadogogical training of the future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will initiate an admissibility test that will bring on their discipline, and then at the end of the year a test of admission that will bring on their capacity to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow situation stages during the M2 year and will be the first year before students as stage teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the concours, you have already received more presence before students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Ministry indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in the national education."
It also reaffirms the draft to remove the school card "with here to 2012."
In Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince climate
Fifty minutes to talk about the summit of Copenhague: it is the deficit that he has reached the morning morning John Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Normal School Higher School of Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Price of Peace, invested the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day constituted by an enhancement of expert interventions, for 15 minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, was a AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that touches people and give them to know more, explained in march of the Conference Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, one of the organizators of this day who takes his name by the students to the fishing of the school.
We have chosen twenty interventioners among the experts of their discipline and have chosen them for their carismatic side.
"We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said the AFP Jean Jouzel, who has been expressed without notes, but with the graphics, before a fifty-fifty persons.
This is part of our scientist role, who hopes that auditors will decline that "Copenhague conference supports an extremely serious scientific document."
The videos of these conferences will be online on the school website from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is prepared in February, followed by others to a bimestrial ritme.
Payment length: wrath of prison surveys, provisioned actions
The prison survey syndicates have called the "General mobilization" to require the exhibition of the annual end of prices and additional hours which the payment has been replaced in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2-syndicate of overseers) asked persons who will not be in service to demonstrate tomorrow morning before penitentiary institutions and "lock them" to "denew the flight of their damage".
The CGT-penitentiaire (3th syndicate of the profession) calls them to "to meet in general assemblies in various prisons for a strong mobilisation," judgeing "hont and inacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "supply hours, night prices, Sunday and Federal Days" worked in October.
And the first survey syndicate, the Ufap/Unsa Penitential Federal Union (Ufap/Unsa), "in call to the general mobilization (...) to reach the disagreement and anger."
The Director of Penitential Administration and the Ministry of Justice explains that additional hours have increased in 2009 and have not all been budgetated but ensures that the reliability will be paid in January.
The Chancellerie decided at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the supervisory syndicats as they guaranteed that this payment would be done on the next month.
I don't know the efforts provided by personals for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, the Ministry of Justice in this mail.
I asked the direction of the penitentiary administration to place a total of measures in view of that this situation was born from a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours in the future, added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the payment of December will be worthy, except for the directing persons who benefit privacy families of functions and objectives, has deployed Ufap/Unsa, for which "the budgetary contracts have a good duty".
It is a pure scandal, the intergovernmental FO of Marseille, announceing his decision to boycotter until the new order "all meetings and convocations".
Personal will not come to work on their lunch and feast days if the months of October are not regularised in December, so for additional hours, FO Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time that our tasks and missions are increased without increase our efficiency, it is more worthy to obtain the deniers of the personnel, estimated the Bordeaux CGT penitentiary.
According to syndicates, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less worse than others.
But in all ways the account is not, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.

During this emission of an hour, at the detonated atmosphere, with an animating festival that was a famous support of Barack Obama during the presidency campaign, the President and his wife also remembered their favorite challenges as children.
Barack Obama called a floor at ten speeds, but also a basket ballon that his father Kenyan saw rarely offered him to Noël.
I remember this time when my father came to see us for Noël and he gave me a basketball, said the President.
It's just later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this ballon.
The first lady remembered her side of her puppet house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house, so I had all the mubles against the wall, instead of arranging them around the road, but I would love this little pocket house, said Michelle Obama.

The Buddhist Government wanted to commit Mr. Zelaya to "demission" and to request the political asylum to the foreign to give him a safe way.

The Government Buddhist, "nowing a new failure I wanted to renew my charge (...), they wanted me to devote," said Judith Zelaya to the Globo radio, on which he often expresses from the beginning of the political crisis that stays from five months in the Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements by the President Dechu, refugeed to the embassy of the Tegucigalpa Brazil for two months and half.
The Mexican embassy has submitted us a request for safe-conduit, but we are surprised that we can't accept it because it does not contain asylum request, he had declared mercredly the Ministry of the Interior of the Buddhist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, at Honduran hrn radio.
I don't ask the asylum to any country, I answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview to the Telesur chain, where the seat is in Caracas.

The female woman then made a disease and would have been hospitalized in the state of choc, according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the alcohol or drug business, according to a police source, would then be running in the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two passors, likely to the haard: one triangle and a squaregenerator, this last grieve.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two bottles to smoke that he was crossed behind the dose, explained on a responsible for the syndicat Alliance in the High-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Many passors, including young people, according to AFP collective witnesses, tried to maintain the force.
I saw a type of 30 years with a green clothe.
Three young men tried to intercept it.

United States: the lawyer of Polandski revokes the continuous disappearance
The lawyer of the French-polar cineast Roman Polanski announced a new judiction in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the loss of gains against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist", denied before three judges of the Court of California's second district of severe mistakers at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I'm exclaiming the loss of charges here and now, Mr Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge carried out at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "he was frod in the dose."
According to him, the judge Rittenband - deceived since - he would have discussed before he was sentenced, with a prosecutor who would tell him that Roman Polanski would meet the prison -- what is a serious error of procedure.
This discussion was discovered in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared that he had "lie" to the author of the document.
In the case of the court would refuse to leave the success, Mr. Hummel claimed to keep a procedure, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentor.
The accusation has reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, to know that none of the charges could be considered seriously studied as Roman Polanski would not be presented before the court.
The cineast, 76 years old, was cut off from the United States in 1978, before his sentence was proclaimed for "illegally sexual relations" with a 13-year-old-year-old.
He never left the feet in the United States since.
The adjoint procureur of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski must be here to present his audience.
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, what is possible to escape?, Mrs. Asayama asked.
For her, the cineast "deserves a favor to the court, although he disappears his authority."
One of the three judges -- which now have 90 days to make their decision -- also underlined him "and there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the absence of proceedings against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called, once again, the end of the success.
Remembering that her client has no longer support to be able to be harceled at every reboundment of the Polanski business, she added: "Person in this room can not say that the procedure has been just.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on American arrest mandate.
After more than two months later, it was assigned to residence in his Gstaad chalet, in waiting for an eventually extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, freshed by the height of the dollar
The Bourse of New York has finished without vendred direction, in a market taken between the best indicators provided in the United States and the highest dollars: the Down Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final numbers of clusters, the Down Jones Industrial Average is mounted from 65,67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq, a technology dominant, left 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The standard & Poor's 500 extension index has progressed from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.06.41 points.
Truly, the market is very quiet, the Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in extreme margins, the change volume has become very low and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as proposed, which "with contributed to improve the view of the market in respect of the solidity of economic renewing," the analysis of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, detail payments increased 1,3% in November for the second month of appeal and more than proposed.
The trust of American consumers was also restricted in December 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimation of the Michigan University Index.
However, the instructions have been broken by a new progression of the dollar, at least two months before the euro, which is “amounted to the economic situation”, explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of the Deutsche Bank.
Technical values have so lost the land.
The obligatory market has been low.
The reward of the good of the Tresor to 10 years has progressed to 3,540% against 3,482% of the evening, and the good to 30 years to 4,497% against 4,492%.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "be very positive", according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "they are very positive," ensures his son David's vendred at the airport of Los Angeles, where he had to go to the head of his father who was hospitalized for several days.
The news are very positive.
It's very strong, it's very well, he told the press David Hallyday at his airport out of the airport that led it from Paris a little after 13h00 local (21h00 GMT).
The son of the son of the cancer, the air departed, assured that he was going to become "trough fast" in the hospital Cedars-Sinai of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was adopted lunch for a consecutive infection in Paris on 26 November.
The song was "played in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of consolidation, to prevent it to suffer and to administrate his treatment," indicated the pressure service.
Johnny Hallyday has already been placed in an artificial coma by the doctors of the hospital Cedars-Sinai of Los Angeles, where he was adopted lunch for a consecutive infection in Paris on 26 November.
The song had to be reopened in the night of judich because of important lessons resulting from this intervention.
Her wife Laeticia went to the French school of Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade is schooled, to assist a school spectacle, has made a photograph of the AFP.
The chirurg of ortopedia and traumatological chirurg of the hospital of Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would be lunch to Los Angeles near the cancer.
The manufacturer violatedly caused Dr. Stephane Delajoux, the neurochirurgian who operated the song on 26 November at the International Monceau Park Clinique in Paris.
We told us that it was a massacre.
The chirurgs of Los Angeles said they were outside, Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "the part of too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorisation of the Parisian chirurg."
I had this doctor on the online one who assured me that there was no problem for this journey, and that was amazing, because I had two disasters, he added.
Before on RTL, he had indicated that the song was apparently "party without drain, without anything", after his parising operation.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the attric Mary Trintignant at Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a newilly-sur-Seine clinic where he was exercised at the time.
In 2007, he also operated Charlotte Gainsburg's activity to resume a hematome after a cerebral hemorragia.
But it is also a doctor to the sufury reputation, condemned in several times by justice, in medical responsibilities, as well as for fishing and scrocking fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Medicines' order, accused him to be "a man without scrupules" continued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "only recommendable."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stephane Delajoux expressed vendred by his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "perfectly broken" and that post-operative tests were "normal".
The operation "not a hemorragic and therefore didn't need the stage of a drain" added.
In any case, the cancer's turn, which has been multiplying from this year, seems to be among parentheses.
Of course, a recurrence of the tour on January 8 (To Amiens, ndlr) as proposed, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.

But on Friday, the UDF Association Office, controlled by the friends of Francois Bayrou who don't listen to deposit, has come out of his silence to launch a place in the Ministry and to the Deputy, so they have no longer to use the sigle and to transmit the property of the mark, under judicial prosecutions.
You have multipled the last days, the statements indicating you to propose to your political movement to +reprender+ the UDF Sigle, write the association in an email signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also believe good to follow your military material and on your website's maintenance page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + l'UDF of today+, also contain the signators of the mail.
As you don't know it, you have no right to use this sigle, explain the UDF office that continues to remove the NC to "immediately the name of the UDF name of all support and (sound) website".
He also requested Herve de Charette "with transmit the property of (la) marked to its right laws."
If you don't do it, the courts would be taken to respect the law and the laws of the UDF adherents, prevent the signaries.
In their e-mail, they claim that the UDF is a political move from 1978 and remember that Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a concurrent movement, as others had done it in 2002 to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore does not have the right to use the UDF simply (union for French democracy).
They also remember that the last UDF congress has voted its adhesion to MoDem for three years and the creation of a office carried out to defense "The material and moral interests" of the education based by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
In relation to Herve of Charette, continued the office, "When he left the mark," he was not "along with UDF since three years", but at the UMP.
He benefits scanded and fraudly from the absence of deposit of the UDF acronic to carry out it for its account.
This indelicateness is intended to be transformed in delict, they declare, before we go on the NC strategy: "It seems that we are just in political, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by yourself than to try out of anonymate by take a fraudly name in which we have no right."
Affair Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for failure
The Court of Nanterre decided to judge the French-Marie Banier artist in order to determine, if, as the daughter of the billionary Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited of a failure state of the officer for the spolier of a part of his fortune.
The photograph of 62 years, known for its stars photos, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for failure abuse, a decree of a maximum threat of three years of immorality and 375,000 euros.
This Decision means that there will be a proceeding procedure in this case a weakness on one of the most rich families in France, in which mother and girls are deceived by having the treasures of the Empire of Cosmetics the Horeal.
But the 15th correctional room also ordered that a medical expert of Liliane Bettencourt, age 87, should be carried collectively by three doctors.
The principal and actor of the Oreal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case, in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre park during the investigation.
The doctors designed for Friday should be reported before 10 March 2010, especially saying that Liliane Bettencourt could be found in failure and in which periods.
I think she'll take her.
I'm going to talk to him, I told the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman.
For his part, the lawyer of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, was welcomed by the court decision.
It's a great new (...) The expert will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
Since two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has achieved a billion of dollars in the case of Francois-Marie Banier, photographer and artists to touch all that she accuses to have benefits during the years of her mother's failure, to get a billion of dollars, under the form of cheques, insurance or tables of masters.
On his side, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photograph, that she consists as a long-date friend.
While the Court had to examine the reception of the action committed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyer's players sometimes turned to the great family deployment.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt made three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his note, in which she spoke to meet her husband of Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the date of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You should explain to my daughter I wrote once in Banier, two times per day for 15 years.
François, I never could talk to him since his marriage."
For his part, Nanterre's park reiterated that the ransom was not acceptable to act, while more than one of the courts rejected the last days to make a right to his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "the full ability to act in justice, she is not under protection and there is no tutor.
Nobody else has to act at his place," said the representative of the public ministry, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court finally decided that it would be pronounced on the acceptability of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management Revolution or End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the Government of the great French enterprises, our fight for the development of economic intelligence would be just...
Since more than a decade of years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises in respect of its salaries, it reminds the position of consumer-based businesses before the marketing revolution: it is to be able to access the collaborators to the "values" designed above as it had been done, to contribute to consumers of products considered by the use techniques.
By putting the customer in the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has rejected market competition strategys to the location, although the authorised intention to introduce products disconnected from customer preference factors regularly returns!
Demobilization of employees can move on a demoral demoralisation.
The suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the part of a greater general phenomenon that touchs particularly the frameworks.
This demobilization commits severely the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including the R&D, and, more, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "requests all the parties to take (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment to the employees that the authorised management recipes are totally involved.
That is why we call to a management revolution that would be to put cooperators in the center of business concerns at the same time as the client.
The use of all related to internal instructions
Internal opinion investigations – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his salaries will they incentive this revolution in the management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid it's not.
- First because I could convince that, face a new situation, all structures are finally coming, after turning away, to make priority... what she always did!
- Then, because the authorism – one of the pathogens of the power – is proportionally to the importance of its own mistakes.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
In the high schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual confort, the old behaviourist theory, reacted recently by the "neuroscience" states and widely diffused, in their insufficient, by studies and media institutions.
So, by suggesting that it is possible for the "levers" (sic) of the enhancement of the frameworks, an recent investigation of Ipsos in The Figaro.fr will strengthen the leaders in a mechanistic government post, inadequated in today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needs for the good function of modern enterprises, is supposed to adopt a final vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate, in any reasonable or practice of government, a fundamental constat: for the salaries, it is possible for the company only if it appears clearly as a way to realize a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the tests of the Motifonational Analysis are adopted by the concept of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predefined dose that allows them to evaluate what she offers to do their life projects.
With the identification and measure of these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, prevent, and anticipate their "social performance" and re-manage their management of human resources "to the place".
They create a country favorable to develop concerted of strong and effective economic intelligence.
Discussions of Oslo: the "governance just" is a loudness right to Obama
The United States Right welcomed the speaker spoke to Oslo by Barack Obama, which satisfied that the Nobel Price of Peace 2009 had defenced the concept of "good-right" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservators, who broadcast the price attribution to Mr. Obama on 9 October, approved this time the President's talk, in the instance of Sarah Palin, an old candidate to Vice-President at the elections of 2008.
I loved what he said, Mrs. Palin, the right airport of the Republic party, at the Day of the United States Today, adding to the theme of the war "foundly necessary" in its memorys that come to be published.
The war is well hearing the last thing of my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she was inspired.
Mr. Obama, who had inherited two wars of his president George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was a Jewish in Oslo to justify the review of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan for nine days ago.
Another adversarier of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the President had done in Oslo a very good job.
I found that the talk was very well, the elder president of the Chamber of representatives, who especially appreciated the statement of "the existence of evil in the world" in the President's proposal.
In some ways, I found this conversation about historic, Mr. Gingrich, questioned when the radiophone "The Takeaway".
The elected elected, considered by some as a candidate to the Republic investment for the President election of 2012, was excited that he had seen "a left president" to remind the members of the Nobel Committee "they would not be free and could not renew a price of peace if it does not exist."
For Michael Gerson, an old George W. Bush's cronicer in Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American talk."
More than presenting in "the world citizen" as "He always does", "He spoke as an American president," remembering Europeans that they live in a security ball that they have not created and that they do not do much to keep it," Mr. Gerson.
Of the right races to be not convinced, a faucon of the old Bush, ancient ambassador in the United Nations John Bolton, qualified the talk of "terne, ampoured and without inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
At the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was warned to see Barack Obama justify the review in force.
When the war is evolved in the notation of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he has been guarded.
However, the left-center press remains elogiable at the place of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continued to think that Nobel was assigned prior to Mr. Obama, has characterized his allocation of "superproduction" even for a known speaker for his talent.
The Oslo's talk "this should be used a road sheet to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California's day had been influenced.
Mr. Obama "pronounced the talk that he needed," he appreciated the New York Times, the judge "in the dark and edifying time."
Routers: three marathons for a agreement to save Noël's approvals
After three sessions of negotiations-marathon, the syndicates of the road sector and the TLF syndicates, the only patronal organization to remain until the top, have been celebrated evening to a agreement that ends in the word of grieve and pestically threatened on the adoptions of Noël.
At the Friday night's meeting, the Secretary of State on Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "rejoiced" of this agreement, after several negotiations sessions, undertaken tomorrow.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators had been left at the Friday morning, with the hope of signing rapidly at the morning the agreement text.
And even if three patron organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had closed the door.
But it was still missing more than six hours of a meeting beginning at 11.00 to all agree and to sign the text at 18.00.
The conflict "It would be very prejudicial for enterprises" and "It was to be afraid that he would suffer the fish of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides a increase of 4% payments for the lower payment (in local and regional route transports) and of 2.9% for the highest (in international transport).
In time, for the low-salairs, "We go over $8,72 to 9.06.
It's not a big thing, but we're part of very far, explained Patrick Close (FO).
We'll give the order to our military men that there's no blocks, no blocks of ravity centers.
But we can always have a few recalculants who are not happy, have he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, has welcomed "good agreement," even if it was "disability to conceal increases on high salaries with the international competition."
According to him, increases will be of the order of 170 euros for payment low and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of the good sense and respect of the salaries, stated Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) has welcomed "a history agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said to him "a acceptable compromise."
The Agreement also provides the revaluation of the 3% movement prices, and the general stage of road transport in the first September 2010, which will be allowed in particular to address the question of 13 months and modernization of the collective Convention.
Mr. Bussereau reminded that "a lot of 100 million euros of patron charges" has made a government amendment to the draft of rectificative financial law for 2009, voted in the day of judiction at Friday by the National Assembly.
The Government will request the Senate to vote "in the same term."
The TLF signature allows the Agreement to apply in the first time to the companies associated with this organization, and in a second time, in the case of extension by the Ministry of Working.
She will be "in the shortest time," Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of pattern organizations can only stop the process.
The FNTR denied a "dropmark" because 100 million euros were already promised to the sector to compensate a part of the carbon rate.
The Secretary-General of Transports has committed us to negotiate in the urgency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order to not contrary the foods of the next reveal, the Unostra deployed.
For the other, the agreement is risking "creasing the d? a great number of PMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."
RER A: Perturbations this weekend, miscontent syndicates of the RATP proposals
The perturbations on the RER A, the most largest transport line in common town in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on the second day of greeting between the RATP syndicates and direction has left them on their famine about their price request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of achievements before Noël, there will be only trains between 10 and 20h00, because of a train on two on the central throne (the Defense and the Nation) and a train outside the central throne.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will allow the travellers to change train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, who wait for 200,000 clients each day, were glad that the RATP makes efforts to maintain the large stores.
The RER A through the west is the Parisian aglomeration.
The RATP stream of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Valleée.
Wednesday, around a train on two rounds at the point hours, and almost no rame in a cross-hour, as proposed.
As a Jewish, there is no cough on which, the French are organized.
Thus, at the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequency than normal, especially the failure of the absence of college and lyceans.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-year-agent engineer, explained that he was raised up a thirty-hour ago, to be sure to come at the time.
The Guard Saint-Lazare has not known health, indicated the SNCF, which had provided an encouraging of agents and forces of the order.
The RER A operated by the SNCF in provincies or to Cergy-Le-Haut or from the Sant-Lazare Garden to join the meters.
New general assemblies of grevis will be held on Sunday and Wednesday, which will examine the results, judged "maigres" by syndicates, a meeting with the Friday direction afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, work time, carrier disruption etc.
It's not what the drivers want, which claims a price due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP also sets its primary proposals between parentheses, the CGT has been insignified, underlined that the direction "not was able to regulate a problem while in the roads and the SNCF was done."
A new meeting is prepared for "a larger examination of professional conditions" stated the RATP.
What has also made to the syndicates that the company "the users of the weekend."
On the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the direction, which refused to all the discussions during the grievous, had suggested "in a challenge of peace" to the meeting.
The conflict threatens to increase the RER B March after a preview by Unsa and Independent.
Syndicates ask a price of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros with 30 variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and plan to degrade work conditions on this line to a million-day travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of the carrier, touch 2.200 to 2.700 euros and 600 to 650 euros for delayed hours, Sundays and Federal Days.
Turkish justice declines the pro-curde Party, a serious decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the main procured part of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by wrath demonstrations in the court community, in the southern east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is risked to greatly compliance the task of the Government, which comes to attach the hand to the short community to try to end up to 25 years of conflict.
The Partie for a democratic society (DTP) was deployed because it was a "foo of prejudicial activities to the independentness of the State and its indivisible unit", said to the press President of the Hasim Kiliç Court, at the end of four days of declaration.
The decision was adopted at the unanimity of 11 judges, while a qualitative majority of seven voices was required to pronounce the resolution, Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the frameworks of the Partie, including President Ahmet Turk and President Aysel Tugluk, are a political life for five years.
The Court also announced the lead of the Parliamentary immunity which Mr. Turk and Ms. Tugluk benefited and the confidence by the Tresor of the goods of the Partie.
The DTP provides 21 seats to the Parliament (for 550).
His leaders had preceded before the verdict that the deputy would leave the Parliament instead of sitting as parlamentars without label.
The decision will follow a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of Abdurrahman Yalzinakaya, which accuses the DTP to obey the "directives" of the Partie of Workers in Curdistan (PKK), considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
A number of observators believe that the DTP is the legal vitrine of rebels in the PKKK.
However, the party ensures that he has no "no organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify this terrorist organization and calls the government to negotiate with him.
The Court's Verdict is involved when the Government comes to stretch up his hands to the court community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to carry out the support of the Kurdes in the PKKK and to end the conflict.
The DTP leaders had stated that a solution could cause a recrudescence of tensions in the South-East-East Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the head of the PKKK Abdullah Öcalan have been declined in horse with the police last weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators were gathered before the DTP locals in Dijarbakir, the large town of the South-East-East town in most Kurdes.
The forces of the order have taken lacrymogene grenades and used water canons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also showed in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Turk stated that the decision of the Justice would "approve the disappearance."
Turkey can't resolve this question (kurde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The Government, formed by a issu part of the Islamist movement, also declared the decision.
We are opposed by principle in the closement of the parties.
This doesn't matter, he told the Minister of Energy Taner Yilz.
This decision is a total tortilation of the democratic opening launched by the Government, commented the political analysis Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, wait for a PKK reaction, has added.
Jeudi, the PKKK invaded a attack that had killed seven soldiers three days later in the north of Turkey, one of the most murderers of these last months.
First neighbors can fall
What you want Wolfgang Brauburger is a very rich hiver.
However, the responsibility of the debt and sample of the traveling services (FES) is not to build citizens.
It's just that agents can test the technical of vehicles and learn well to manager them.
And after the meterology, it could be well for this week's end.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and snow.
The FES follows here a very designed plan.
Mr. Brauburger explains that since he was rent on the city of Francfort and that temperatures are descending under zero, large sable vehicles have 20 major inheritors (Internative names A) .
This includes large circulation streets, main arts, such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes pumping access, community transport equipment, pioneer areas and streets in pente, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES agents start their service at three hours of the morning.
In the case of need, the 1040 kilometers of driving must be saved with a road funder that adds well at 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3:00 of the morning "to be disappointed when the train of journal migration is beginning."
There or it happens more difficult, it's when the snow goes down at 7:30 tomorrow.
This has problems, we said the responsible for the disastering and sample of traveling services "cause no automobile is ready to leave the sale vehicles."
Then, if he's snow more, we'll buy access paths and desert routes - like the Rat-Beil-straße.
The secondary ways and the side streets are finally coming.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this is always a few statements.
At five hours of the morning, the FES Pedester team was on the way to depart in priority the dangerous judicial areas and passments.
With regard to cycle tracks, the FES services are generally not able to be occupied.
Mr. Brauburger claims that there is a special service in Francfort to monitor the status of the points between 22 and 4:30.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, the sale vehicles intervene when temperature descends below 2 degrees.
It also arrives that the police calls this special service even needs.
The branch of the dinosaures
The Tawa hallae seemed like other carnivor dinoses: this bipede measured about 2 meters long for 1,50 meters, its poster members were powerful, his long crown was made of accessible and recurbed dents, his short arms ended by faucille and had a long chew.
If this specie had lived a few million years later, she would have nothing exceptional.
However, as the report of Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austria and his colleagues in the Jewish Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinoses that maintain these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived for 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which makes part of the surcontinent, Pangee, and was in the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of Tawa's light of a new day the evolution of the first dinosure.
In fact, it tells us about parent links, distribution and characteristics of these last.
It's in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt has undertaken other Palestinians, on the Gohst Ranch website north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Natural History of the Utah and member of the football team tells them that sometimes he came to find a dozen insects in a day what is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer given by Trias.
The scientists were very quick to know that one of these bones was a new species.
The fools have updated the rest of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories on the beginning of the evolution of the dinosaures.
The researchers baptized him in the name of Tawa according to the word of Hopi Indians for the sun God.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is a very exceptional discovery: the dinosour phossiles coming from Trias are extremely weird and are limited to some incomplete oxygen fragments.
All Palestinian experts don't share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, however, it determines that it allows to confirm some theory on the beginning of the evolution of dinosaures.
According to the current state of knowledge, the dinosures are appeared on the Earth for about 230 million years.
Most of the oldest fossiles, however, are fragmented and incomplete what makes very difficult to classify all the first dinosures.
Experts are asked in the time when the Saurians were divided in three major groups of evolution: the theropodes (carnivors) that include tiransaure and the velociraptor appear later and where the birds are descending, sauropodes, squareds long-terms, and those who appear to them and the ornitic herbiveres who are part of the species such as the triceratops and the stress.
According to S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first therapists.
This species presents an interesting report of characteristics at first and developed time, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found indications that let the Tawae hallae think that there were small aircrafts in his bones at the breast level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the heropodes.
These small air balls facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammifers.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the branches were also partly filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest terapists presenting small aircrafts in his bones.
As the appearing line of large sauropodes also had air sacks and a lower bones, they may think that their common ancients had already existing of this beneficial innovation.
Three successive migration vagues to North America.
As the most primitive dynamishers lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Sauriens were there.
Thus, the three large lines of evolution have been divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world is to say the whole amazed earth that formed the supercontinent Pangee.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Palestinian team also discovered the rest of two other terapists that are not particularly appeared to him.
Three species can't descend from a common ancient who would have mixed, progressing researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and the Scientific Science Science Counterer says that there would be at least three migration vags to North America.
There's been some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn says that there is another oldest species, the silence, which lived in the current Poland and is a group appearing to the dinosaures.
Following him this could give a wrong vision because there is a large number of dinosaur fossiles that have been preserved in South America while there are practically no one on other continents.
In contrast, how the dinosaures have come to become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary age, while they had a relatively rare line of the reptiles, there is still a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, the dinosaures shared their lives with many other reptiles, such as the olders of the current crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaures were divided on all the planet that favored the development of many new species while others, which appeared to them, were lost between the Trias and Jurassic.
However, such success is not forever.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could be a massive extinction in which the dinosaures have survived in a random way while other reptiles would have lost.
Or then, the dinosaures were better adapted and then they could remove the competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not forever.
150 million years later, the smoking of a favorite meteorological scanning of a group of animals that was also developed during the Trias and who had finished in the shadow: it was mammifers.
The Solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signators of the whole world.
There are teachers of the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna and Berkeley in California.
There are the course carriers of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brüme.
The evacuation by the police of the University of J.W. Goethe de Francfort makes vagues on the whole planet.
278 teachers and teachers of the University J.W. Goethe but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and Southern America expressed their solidarity with the Protestant Students of the Westend Campus.
In a German and English declaration, they condemn the intervention of the police called by the Director of the University Committee.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Müller-Estler had made the buildings occupied by students and teachers in a large way that walls and art works were barboiled with graffitis.
Five students were hurt during evacuation.
The signators judge that degradations did not justify "a very violent intervention from the police command in contact with students and teachers who had organized their own course."
evacuation represents an "inacceptable expectation" to research and education freedom.
The fact that focuses exclusively on vandalism acts is only to "delegitize and criminalize the protest" and try to forget the reasons of mobilization.
The University Director Committee thus submitted debates that would still be indispensable.
The course carriers require that penalty continues to be immediately suspended.
Most of the occupants have not participated in degradations.
Legitimation of Protestations
Youths of the Verde syndicate of the services sector and the German Confederation of Syndicates (DGB) have shown solidarity of students.
Protestations are only the legal expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of youths of the Verdi syndicate.
With regard to the Ministry of Science of Hesse Eva Künne-Hörmann (CDU), she took and caused the action committed by the President of University and Police.
We thank the President of the University.
All occupation and degradation of the sites is totally inacceptable, she said to the Regional Committee of Wiesbaden last Jeudi when the television emission is currently issued.
We understand the sense of protests, but we don't accept vandalisme, expressed the President of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition of SPD, the Verts and the Left (the Link) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, says Janine Wissler from the La Left (Link)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and revendications of students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party made a movement to the Ministry of the Interior to repeat a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
During a long time, she was the reputation of the secret town, prohibited to the west visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for the secret army, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants from the centre of Moscow, the community has the reputation of being the Soviet Valley.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nano-electronics are implanted.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Zelenograd have linked to Riedberg, where Francopolis scientists – with universities and society of the Innovation Centre of Francfort (FIZ).
There were recent reciprocs and merchandise meetings of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Etroit Cooperation Protocol".
The signaries were the Moscow's vice-mair of Juri Rosljak and the prefeitor Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, project section leader for Francfort.
In 2010, the representatives of the FIZ and the PMEs, whose strong point is the scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Change
It's a sustainable scientific switch.
But also economic relations.
It will allow the FIZ society to enter into the Russian market full expenditure.
In contrast, Russian scientists want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of Sweden Soviet research institutions.
There is the Institute of Moscow electrotechnic, the large Sitronics and Rossijska-Electronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist village" for armed research.
Zelenograd (the literal training "Green City") shoots his name of the collines in the heart of which research centres are implanted.
The S21 project: a train for Stuttgart
We can't place enough up the width of Stuttgart 21 project.
For his participants, there is nothing less than “new heart of Europe”.
S21, it is more than the effort of a ferroviary garage, more than a colosal construction project that will blow the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a despert chaos of chains for a decade of years.
Stuttgart 21 is born from the spirit of the 80s.
The line heads, with ways that were completed in full town, had the reputation at the time to be the reliability of the technology of transport technology of the 19th century, which had effect of sabots of french of modern ferroviary trafic because it had much time to pass the location behind.
Come on, stop quickly, leave -- that's what we need to do.
That's why the line heads should be lost: in Francfort and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train train training garage, which is at mid-chemin around the Transeuropean Magister of the rain between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, from where the "European heart".
The implementation of the S21 project will really be started, although visions of the 80s are not long-termly compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognize that the cost, in order to achieve the garage in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavière, was exorbitant.
In fact, line heads are not realisticly able to have input and exit problems since there are modern trains, reverible with authors and car pilots at both extremists.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now launched at the new track of the inter-town line to Ulm.
Regional and common policies have brought it.
The company of ferry paths is part of the part, and it is the contribution that makes the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public business.
From urbanistic views, this project will be relatedly justified.
We have a town space that – if we believe the graphics of the computer generated by computer – will be very verde.
The S21 is negative for the shipping system.
The traveling and expanding of the section is designed for a trafic of persons in which they were assigned - and it is typical of the 80s - a great growth.
At the time there was no competition of good market flows.
The modern training policy should first focus on the strengthening of the training of markets because the transport through the road is much more respectful than the environment than the training on the road.
But the new training, with its inclination, does not correspond to the trains of marketing.
The S21, and this is much more serious about indirectly well of other ferroviary projects.
For example, six billion euros will be broken in the Suabe project.
It's the official number.
Experts think that ten to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade, this money will miss for other joining and enforcement points in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transports in all sixty large projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhin valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987, this line is built on the range.
It would be really urgent to support here on the campaign.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a french sabot.
The inheritance of the Rhin valley is able to become the foreign gull of the trafic of international markets, and that is full of the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the jurisdiction made on the airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the Land urged the opportunity to call to the Hesse Administrative Court on the prohibition of air flying night.
The Ministry of the Economic Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that CDU/FDP coalition had carried experts to examine the jurisdiction made by the Administrative Court and that is a document that understands more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the country should apply the regulation on the prohibition of night flows in the case or the project of construction of the north-west airport of Francfort.
Attorney authorisation for 17th and 5th of the morning, such as the Government of the Country is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturn aircrafts.
Coalition must have decided for the 4th January if it wants to make a case against the judge made.
The critical opposition of this period and trys to press the representative of the Government in order to be carried out to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The Leader of the SPD-Parliamentary Group Torsten Schéfer-Gumbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises before the elections and that is to interrupt the night flows. If not, it will be condemned as a total missing to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the captain of the Verts Tarek Al-Wazir by attaching the electronic Slogan of the FDP "We have our promises."
The Ministry Dieter Posch rejects Scherfer-Gumbel's reproach that the Government of the country is trying to authorize even the night flows using "d'avocasery and roblardises".
It needs time to take a specific legal examination.
Coalition does not want to decide on the basis of a "first fast pressure".
The decision must be legally faithful, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flows is completely strictly threatened.
United States banks reward the aid
The large American banks, very touched by the crisis, depart from their vital links in the state.
The American Bank announced mercred that she had totally rewarded $45 billion in the Tresor ($30 billion), which corresponds to the assistance provided in the Tarp Safety Plan.
The CNBC television chain made known in a report that Citigroup also requested to reboot the received assistance.
Banking institutions so look forward to discharge imposed restrictions, which comply with the acceptance of the sums, such as the limit of goods assigned to the leader and the higher cost Regulation.
The United States Bank started a capital increase by the sale of tits to investors who reported him $19 billion.
The rest of the sum offers boxes of the bank that are well fulfilled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last night, Kenneth Lewis, the General Director of the American Bank of America, expressed thanks to the US contributions: the capital injection was very helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had submitted its capacity to raise the Merrill Lynch investment bank as stronger of the financial tourment.
Citi Group also encourages to seek money on financial markets to free from the State's protection.
The U.S. Bank could thus launch a capital increase of 20 billion dollars, reported the CNBC chain quoting bank environments.
Citigroup's port-word would not like to comment this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had rewarded the public funds they had benefited.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything has passed as soon as soon as soon as it was proposed.
At two weeks after the limoge of the current editor in Chief Nikolaus Brender by the German ZDF Chain Administration Council, the successor has already been named.
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday to implement the nomination.
Peter Frey who leads the Berlinois ZDF redaction was the big favorite.
However, the chain didn't want to confirm - officially - the vote to not prevent the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire to not be white more than the ZDF Markus Schacher's attention if the proposal would not be accepted by the Administration Council.
Frey, who was the candidate of Schacher, had needed a vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known in the closement of the editing.
Two weeks ago, Shecher had proposed the Advisory Council to prolong the contract of Nikolaus Brender for five years, but it was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were stated favorable to Brender's reduction and 7 others voted against, and Brender's vote was a failure that would be provided for Shecher.
In fact, the CDU, which is major to the Administration Council, has already left to hear several weeks before the vote, does not want to reduce Brender to his post.
It's Roland Koch, the President of Hesse Land, who had organized a call against the editor in the head.
He refused that the contract of the very exciting editor in the leader would be prolonged by calling the fact that the audit tax of the ZDF information emissions had been low under Brender.
That is why protestations were still placed, almost until the vote, increasing the growing policy influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were 35 public law experts who were immissed in the debate and who estimated that the way to act of Koch was anticonstitutional.
But this wouldn't serve anything.
Peter Frey, who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogology and Roman languages (Spain).
He then worked in the Southwest function (Rhenania-Palatinat Radio) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German German port).
In 1983, it becomes a editor in ZDF first in the current journal (the day-day journal).
After its parking continued: from 1988 to 1990, he was the representative of the editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, and then to 1998, he was head and representative of the "Morgenmagazins" (by-mensual information emission present) until 2001, and he was responsible for the foreign ZDF policy and the Berlinise rehabilitation.
After Brender's disgrace, while this was just a journalist of the year by the specialised media Magazin review, the Verts announced that they had a constitutional statement
The advocator of Koch to the Advisory Council, the President of Rennie-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF to not be blocked by a party political majority.
Nevertheless, Beck does not inquire to request the rehabilitation of members of the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the probable successor of Brender had happily been maintained to the Administration Council by criticising the Commission with vehicular decision of Limoger Brender.
With this journalistic independence evidence, Shacher was intended to propose it for the post of editor-in-headed post without losing the face, even as the Administer Council could exceed it without submitting it to a political party to the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the Parties, Frey is classified on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a long-term year, the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs of the countries incident to show more conciliant: in a meeting between the Ministry and the Delegated of the Conference of Rectors, a agreement was established in the point that the work conditions of Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be capable of coming up with their studies.
They are particularly agreed to enhance the rate of the tests: a unique test should allow closing the selected study module.
Furthermore, the load of work should be recognised to ensure "realist and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of the studies between universities and foreign.
Otherwise, the countries are encouraged to organize more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master branches.
At regional level, there is no different regulation from one country to another.
Experts
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last, the Ministry of Education of the countries and universities recorders have the expression in the mode: "Educability".
But for the first time this expression seems to take a concrete significance.
The accreditation advice decided to reduce significantly the number of certain reviews: "Every modules must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination," may be read in a document of a 30-year pages on future admission conditions to university cicles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Advisory Advisory, states that, in the extent reducing the load of tests, it should be able to stop the disasters, which were considering considerable to education.
"Educability" should be surrounded, in the future, the decision-making criteria of the study organization.
The modules as the background should be considered seriously to see if we can't deny this feeling of exhaustion that sometimes it feels in the course selection.
Hambourg / Berlin - According to the last knowledge of Kunduz, the opposition estimates that the Ministry of Defence Karl-Theodorzu Guttenberg (CSU) is a delivered throne.
Students should "have the opportunity and margin of the needed manage to allow and improve the personal initiative."
The new regulation will include access to new university cicles but will also be adapted to existing cicles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, however, that is only in 2015 that all cycles will be considered.
There are 10 competent accreditation agents on the whole federal territory depending on the advice of adoption created by the countries.
In October, the Ministry of Education had carried out a certain pressure on the countries that they would require the agences to not be carried out too much and the regulation of the tests.
In some countries, universities and high-specialised schools have already heard with their regional ministry to take appropriate measures.
The Rhenania-Palatinat is the only country that has given its agreement to achieve more ways to develop the Bolón process.
With these funds, universities need to organize tutorized programmes to strengthen pedagogic orientation offices, as well as the offices of the examens and the service of international relations
The countries and universities provide for this a budget of 10 million euros.
In the beginning of 2010, the Government wanted to give Parliament a amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this, there will be no longer one test for closing his studies.
The study organization should be more flexible, and it is necessary to ensure that the recognition of the notes of other higher education institutions and the access to the Master should be simplified.
From here the end of the next year, the "Education" of all university cicles will be examined.
The last Jewish Government and Opposition have discussed the question of studies in the country.
The decisions were approved but critics were made to hear.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has made known that he would wish that the organisation of educational policy would not be in the future "the closed doors" of the Ministry and university Records.
Later after the educational grid, students as concerned should be able to express a little.
The future diplomats of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegated Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful" she said to join a meeting with the Ministry of Education of the countries with which the HRK works on a common reform project.
For the syndicate of education and science (GEW), the decisions taken to Bonn will not be sufficiently far, and he calls the right and the possibility for each Bachelor diplomated to enter a Master cicle.
Andreas Keller member of the Director Committee of the GEW requests otherwise that the countries assess the students of Bachelor today, that there will be enough place for studies in Master and the conditions of study as well as possible.
The countries should therefore build more course carriers.
In contrast, the Ministry of Education did not excuse the possibility to enhance access to the Master.
More than one page bottom on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Come in Germany and is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner poet, in which he is thematised in broken phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but has lost his language territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first teacher of German and English in Bucarest and, afterward, a collection director in a young school house before installing Francfort on Main.
Söllner received several literary prices; in 1993 he had the very convicted poesy room of the University of Goethe de Francfort and since 2002 he was director of Hesse's literature forum to the Mosonturm's house in Francfort.
He made a lot of talk about him in the last March non-literary circles, when a congress in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the miroir and the miroir deforming your Security folders."
Visiblely destabilised and generous, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his colleagues of German writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Security Policies.
Söllner received the price of German language in 1989 together with some of the participants.
In 1971, the exploiting tests had started immediately.
I am, concluded Söllner, "So someone who doesn't have enough to stay at the intimidation of the Security."
The poet Werner Söllner is Walter (IM Walter).
In addition, with the respect of the Nobel price for Herta Müller and his literary designs with the mechanisms of the power of the dictature, the literary scene is broken, and in particular the community of the German authors originating of Romania, in a case that clearly shows the areas and the basicness of a political system based on police monitoring and spionage.
Werner Söllner is, as we can say about the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victims.
In his own folder Security, IM Walter played a role, ensure the specialist of the literature Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and returned to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intercepted in his favor.
"He could take him from all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel rejected the moral need to make this comment.
The form of which Söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however, the obstacle of an ancient dissident of his cooperation with Roman secret services is not really surprising.
Germany is a favorable reserve for the Security Species had already written Herta Müller in July in the "Die Zeit", after reading 914 pages of his own folder.
We can imagine that the victims have made specifications and sometimes have declared what real names have been hidden last of the names of Surin, Voice and Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi documents is a faithful process, the vital attitude on the inheritance of the Security documents is still very confused.
A systematic lighting has been without contraried and franched in the past years.
It is only in 1999 that a national advice that corresponds to the Birthler institution was created to work for the assumption of the Security Archives (CNSAS), but the refund of the documents has been replaced since.
There is a law that defines the management of the archives since 2005.
The influence of ancient members of the Security in Romania is yet very large, confirmed by the interview of an old responsible for the Temesvar Security who, after announced the Nobel Price to Herta Müller, is expressed in the meaning of the lauréate.
She had a psychose, and finally we asked her only one time.
The infamia of power thought that could be expressed here without any gen, under the cover of the freedom of expression.
Certainly, although inelectual issues are associated with Söllner as it occurs so often in a hidden context of guiltability.
Why now? Who has been spoiled? The reaction of auditors, at Söllner's aviation, let them hope that the following chapter will be defined more by a suspect of knowing than by accusations and feelings of fear.
On the genius of the work of Herta Müller, which has received the Nobel price yesterday, is more than a note on page bottom.
Tumules in the League Chambers
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, fired at four emplings coming on the right of a Noël Sympa party, on which the manufacturer of sport articles had spent his markets when the new veterinary VFB Christian Gross mounted at the middle of the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just came to call, a pure plastic sack of the provider in the hand.
The man, whose hot crown would take care, left him to lead to the city that was still a stranger.
Furthermore, our fifty-general could take the flight himself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't more happy drink.
He had past a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he had to take the job again.
Because it's now that's going to start.
The words of Swedish that we arrived in three days ago were clear: “We have achieved the eighth of the end,” is to say in the line of fields through our 3:1 against UNirea Urziceni in Romania, but we don't have to let us get successful. This will be a brutal battle to not return."
The "great work" is waiting for the morning.
There, it is to repeat to Mainz the results of the call of campions to day.
And it will be necessary to surround the weaknesses that have repeated on the surface after the three expeditional objects of Marica (5.), Tresch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Shooting on the ground
The eighth end of the League Champions (match go to 16./17. + 23./24 February/match return 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be taken up on 18 December to Nion.
The joy of the entrance in fulminant function of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate to him who had brought chance, who had transmitted to Stuttgart's employees destabilised, a fair motivation and a pleasure to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should concentrate on their faces, I encouraged them to be stronger, explaining the "plambier of the souls" - Gross - the success receipt that he sooner dreams that did not more effects with her sister Babbel.
He declared a certain magic, said Jens Lehmann - Parsen of Babbel -, "in the foot when there is a new impulse, it happens sometimes about things that we would never believe."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of breaking for worry, went on to the range of the best player through his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon designed by a "free wind" phenomenon and the job method of the new chief: "It's someone who passes to the action and requires the disciple.
This is what we need in the present situation. ”
But apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't past his head, keeping the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart has especially needed tension.
As Gross, the players and the manager are able to assess the victory against a totally excessive defence and refuses Roman invitations.
They also win in Glasgow before there were four days later a bad survey in Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signed that they had a good goal of the saison objectives but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't past the hard head yet.
That Heldt the day of his 40th anniversary was not the heart to make the party, even after the first home victory since three months, was the events of the weekend, but a television interview from the guard of Jens Lehmann just before the beginning of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens would contrary Heldt in response to Lehmann's criticism.
He had accused the low style direction and said she had decided to change trainer under the pressure of pubert fans.
Lehmann was also judged as a sign of suvereignty and jalousiele that his free day after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by a pure egoism ” inherited Heldt and announced the consequences of the target guarantee.
They had no longer risked to become friends for life these two fourgenerators.
In all cases, they were agreed for all the rest, it was to say that without the preliminary work of the group by the replaced trainer, the strong sport and battle representation would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in success” returned to Heldt and Lehmann in heart – and even the man at the plastic sack.
World Championates Pouds
Short fight in Berne : Kevin Johnson, the challenger, made the campaign of Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, the Ukraine defends his champion title of the world of severe pounds according to the WBC Federation version.
In the unianimity of the judges, he implied the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains his title of champion of the world of severe pounds.
The WBC Federation announced that in the Sunday night the campaign of 38 years had brought a victory to the unanimity of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko defends his title from his comaback on scene in October 2008.
Before Ukraine has already submitted the campaign title of the World of WBO and WBC Federations.
Unfortunately, he didn't succeed the KO so long.
Klitschko, out of 39 times winning in 41 professional battles, has two times avoided his deficit due to wounds.
The challenger Johnson accepted his first default at the 24th battle.
In Berne's Arene, before 17,000 spectators, the Great Klitschko wanted to dictate the battle from the top of its 2,02 meters, by its left.
Johnson, of 11 centimeters smaller, who, before the dust, announced the end of the Klitschko's age, succeeded to disappear the campion's shoes, instead of Klitschko to go into the game against his right dangerous.
Johnson, too passive action for a challenger, especially trying to go through the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and managing his shoes only waiting for the campion very rarely.
It's even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, over with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger made a lot of dreams in the Switzerland capital before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko the treacher of “vilain zombie” who“ is not really capable. ”
During the wedding wedding, the campaign could not stop prevent Johnson to fall down his nest soldiers to see his eyes.
Fourth victory from Klitschko's coming.
Klitschko was set again in his fourth fight since his comback on 11 October 2008
After a break of nearly four years, he struck at the time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and received "sa" WBC ceinture that he had before to leave without war.
This year, defending his campion title, he brings the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
"I just took a couple in this fight and I'm in perfect form," said Klitschko to explain his quick return on the ring.
His frame is to try to meet the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of WBO and IBF Federations.
But it's the British David Haye who, having destroyed the great Nikolai Walev - 2,13 meters - in November, brings the WBA ceinture.
This was, Haye had an interrupt match against Vitali Klitschko who had to be held in September.
It seems that his promoting company will now play this match at the Wembley station in London.
Kanduz's Affair
The frontal attack of the opposition: Leader of the Secretary-General of the Verts, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Ministry of the Guttenberg Defense of lying in the case of Kunduz Affair.
The SPD Parties and the Left (the Link) request the possibility of explaining.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the recent information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition was invited to the Ministry of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have delivered certain facts.
The Ministry intendsly "formed a convergency" on the murder fraction of two citers in September last, said the chief of the Secretary-General of the Verts, Jürgen Trittin, samedi during the exmission of information from the ARD Chain "Tagesschau" (The Journal of 20h).
Of course, that means he's lying.
The order of kill was given to the total disabilities of the International Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in the meantime, the content of the OTAN report and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of lafrappe was real, not to destroy the driving rooms, but was well to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the Research Report of OTAN, 142 persons were killed or violated during the U.S. air attack that was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Verts, the SPD and the Left prayed on Saturday of Angela Merkel (CDU), to pronounce in the most shortest time before the Federal Parliament and to demonstrate what Guttenberg really knew about the accident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Verts Renate Künast are in view that Madame Angela Merkel should clearly say if the massacre strategie is part of the African Government policy if the ability, army and information services have approved this new strategy.
The Port-word of the Government rejects these critics.
In any case, the challenge has not influenced the military interventions in Afghanistan.
Saturday, votes were more stronger to express doubts for the real reasons of the remitting of the general inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it was presented by the Ministry.
According to the information of the SPIEGEL Journal, the information they had been submitted to Guttenberg on the attack of citers were at the time correct and complete.
Officially, they would have discovered the existence of the OTAN report and hidden the Ministry some generous detailed detail.
In the context of the two high officers, they have heard that they have informed the Ministry of the Defence of Existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter General Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested an e-mail a clarification of the facts.
It hasn't received a answer until now
Sabate, the Ministry did not want to comment these accusations and sent to the Federal Parliament Research Commission to be the next March to bring light on the issues.
The dream Worlds
Some see, all wake up, images, and hear voices that no one can see or hear.
There is only in psychic diseases, or under drug effect, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
While these phenomenons appear during the dream, everything's all right.
When we are attracted in our rooms, we can serve us without entering to the dreams and the foolest fantasies.
However, he who, awake, makes the dream experience, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has quickly reputation in our western world to be foolish or drugs, or at least to be a original.
These images and voices appear not only in psychic diseases or under the effect of drugs.
This is our imagination that is why it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to conceal houses, pink tables or write Romans, but that sometimes incites the limits between dream, fool and reality.
A conscious state, takeing the shape of a dream, may be presented under the most different forms, in the best cases it is called visions, in the worst of the fool.
But even if the declarer and effect is distinguished, the visions of the mystical Hildegard van Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Carlos Castaneda prophet, the second states of calls, psychoses and hallucinations are immune to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delays when the equilibration, neurotransmetric substances of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and acethylcholine - breaks and that interaction between the various parts of the brain is perturbable.
Complicated hallucinations and delirant thoughts are very often demonstrated during a schizophrenic psychose.
Earth attack force has no more power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophy and doctors, they have always been looking on the relationship between fool and dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations were a form of dreaming; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, was in 1861 "a large comparison between the folly and the dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychose with all irregularities, imaginations, delights and sensory illusions that composes it."
We are in 2001 when Henning T becomes personnage of a designed band.
His body is in two sizes to created colours.
The earthly attraction has no power over him, he plans at the ground.
He feels a little bit.
Following him of the creatures of ailed devil, crying out, the mouth enhanced, showing the dents.
They continue him, they give him footballs with hot flamboy bottles, throw him against the walls, he feels painful in all the body.
Tonitruans, bad, smoking, out of walls and radio.
He can't support these voices who insulte it and humil it.
Henning T. rings two boxes of his stereo chain, actually a ball and attack to a crochet fixed on the ground.
He's up on a ball and walks around the cow.
He's sauce.
The bowl's cut off.
That's what you need to learn, cry the voices in a heart to throw him the thipon. "Go into a clinic and make you happy!"
Today Henning T., 40 years old, he lived six aiguous psychose, the last date of 2 years, the first of about 20 years.
She was declined by the LSD.
The diagnostic: psychose schizo-effective, paranoid, in addition, is maniaco-depressive, he takes medicines against depression, manie, skizofrenia.
He learned to live with his disease, he was married three years ago.
During the psychose, I lived terrible fears and deep disappearances.
Illusions are a serious reality.
A percentage around the population suffers at least one time in his schizophrenia life; in psychiatric clinics is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the concerned persons can no longer do the difference between the internal world and the external world, they find in a state of hyper excitation, which makes them to suffer halucinations, buthamania, relational folly or persecution.
It is very courageous to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optic hallucinations are no more weird.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the significant and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the perturbator signals, the knowledge is white under the feelings.
As the dream, psychose opens the exception of ideas and fantasies from the deepest layers of the conscience.
The perception of the reality in the psychose is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, leader of the CHU of Heidelberg (Algemeine Psychiatrie in Universitysklinic) .
The skizophrene is in the center of the situation, all at a significant meaning on him.
In the same time, he is found in a passive role, he is like a dream, override by events and can't act on them actively.
That's why shizophrene feels often threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a serious reality, they are excluded.
Make experience once in his life of a hallucination.
In the difference of the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensoral and spatial structure of reality that is persuaded during the psychose, is fundamentally maintained."
The thoughts and allucinations are based on the reality, the alliance of life is in a real frame.
Why our brain does this kind of cabriols, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations may bring each one to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a few people will develop a psychose.
It seems that there is a genetic proposal in the skizophrenia, but studies on jumeles have shown that genes are not only the definitive factors.
Researchers suggest that the persons concerned are cerebral infections.
It is supposed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is perturbed to a pre-development stage, for example, by a viral infection of mother during the growth, explain Fuchs.
But what remains unexplied is the way the neuronal system's annually produces and surrounds the fact that it does not appear for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychotic declarer, however, if there is a pre-disposition.
In the same way, the hallucinagene drugs can discover psychose because they act on neurotransmiters.
When our brain is chauffed.
What is crazy, we say the professor of psychologist Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that psychotics suffer their hallucinations and take precious medicines to disagree when others buy strong drugs to procure them.
The welcome or disappointable perception of the illusions often is just a question of view.
Kasten collected 10 years of reports on the hallucinations and the phenomenon of illusory images: last year he published his results in a titled "The Irreal World in our head."
The hallucinations are well part of the typical phenomenes of psychose, but also of an impressing number of other pathogens.
We are considered psychic problems such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsie, sclerrose in plaques, Alzheimer's disease or cronish traumatism.
It is surprised that in some circumstances, even the brain of healthy persons is concerned about hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of fragments of memories that are usually inhibited.
They take form when the cerebral areas that treat sensorial perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refreshed; when our brain hair but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can declare this state as a cerebral lesion or a psychose.
But also the missing of stimulation, stress, love chagrins or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of the participants recognizes the experience of a hallucination at least one time in his life.
In 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lives in a small city of Mecklemburg-Pomerania, and she goes to the school.
A young girl's doing everything normal to say.
If there's no images and voices.
During the re-creation, a young boy, kids, a long chatten hair addressed him the word.
When she replies to her friends looking at her, amazing – nobody else sees and hears this boy.
They think that this little girl is a lunatic dream but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's wake up, hearing and seeing this boy as she sees and hearing the girl sitting near her on the bank.
She can even understand his presence immediately.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young sympathy.
I'm foolish, she's asking you sometimes.
But she knows well that this young and the other visions are not real and they will lose again.
The apparences are generally stressing.
Many visions are serious.
When she is in class, she is not able to follow the course because the teacher is just training to present a new student in her eyes and his ears while he is invisible for others and the teacher is visible to explain equations on the table.
The apparences are generally stressing.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the dream that comes too rarely and soon later, she can't often do the distinction if she is waxed or dream already, if the images she see, the faces or the young girl with blood-tailers on his arms and feet are found before her eyes open or closed.
Let me be quiet, she calls these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they would take her for a fool.
In 2009, Sarah K. at 20 years.
She had her bath last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with the Psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she is not foolish.
The fool is also a despert art work.
When someone is socially isolated or doesn't have enough stimulations, the probability is greater than he has hallucinations on a certain time.
I suppose the brain is not enough occupied, so that there is an animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone.
Her hallucinations started when she learned at 13 years, that the man she called Dad, since she was in age to think, was not her true father.
These are the same cerebral areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and bruises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between the illusion and the reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "he is in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of halucination.
The hallucinations of healthy persons are not fundamentally distinguished from them in alike psychose.
In contrast of shizophrene, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one of the dreams and the halucination.
In our world, too focused on the conscience, we have unfortunately tendance to take imaginary experiences for patologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychose is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creator - the folly is a work of the despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience dite niniroid, a particular form of the change of the conscience of the dream.
Niniroides are very complex dreams that are persuaded as real by him who lives them and that he can't differ from the dream even when he is awake.
Oneroid conscience states in a traumatism or in extreme patological situations such as for patients who are fully known, are experienced by a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and of the world, due to a total and sustainable incapacity to move, he replaces this real situation that brings to his life, by his own imaginary world that is separated from the reality.
It's a mental state between dream and halucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of the world has been made, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is a intense form of means and interpretation, in an inheritable situation, an organization capacity that is given to us, men, in order to not humble in the loss of consciousness.
Everything's real even later in memorys.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Class, his story of art also describes his nitroid experiences in his book "Changement of heart" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscious part of a travel of several days after a cardiac valve follows a transplantation; during this time his body is condemned to stay immobile in reanimation.
Clausen plots in a world he created from all parts, visiting strangers, traveling in time. He sees an old man in a ferroviary sanitary, a robot on his cheese running on his health.
He lived in the middle of the age among the nobles that produce drugs based on blood.
He is removed by a Greek moto that leads him into his country, he surprises with his hospital bed in the Alpes' neighborhood and meets a famous Korean.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is actually even later in his memory.
According to Clausen, these internal travels are fundamentally different from all dreams.
The dream is a very different state, writeing in writing what he lives.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of mental traveling are extremely clear and very detailed for years later.
We can even say they are more distinct and intensive than real life.
The intensity of this living makes the horizon of our other day experiences, according to the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the niniroid delays, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedal experiences show us how much our internal representations of external reality are fragiles even in safety.
Every change of the conscience state, the psychologist Kasten says, "and can make a deformation of what we call the reality."
A experience that can also be very rich.
First neighbors can fall
Burda
In 27 years, the children will take the afternoon of the editing house.
The name of Kallen at the PDG of the Burda editions is an intermediary solution: to longer, Hubert Burda wants that his two children repeat the press group, he said to the Spiegel Journal.
The holding must remain a family business at 100%.
Hamburg - A long term, the editor Hubert Burda sees his society between his children's hands
Two children will inherit 27 years and are closely decided to integrate the society, Hubert Burda, 69 years, in Spain.
All details have been regulated in the past.
The question to know whether they will be active in the business will be once.
He should also see if they are capable.
We can't impose their children to 7500 collaborators without know if they have the ability to take care of them.
This would demoly the children as well as the business.
Burda had made known the last Jeudi that he would go from the president-General office since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the Administration Council since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technological sector.
Following the Tresor sector, he was responsible for the business capital and after Jürgen Todenhefer, he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, impression and finance.
So for the first time this is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who would have been 42 years ago, has been decisived for a few years ago.
The name of Kallen is also to make the link of the 10 or 15 next year"
Burda claims that the holding should remain at 100% between the family's hands.
The rules have always been located in families who have been left to enter by a capital bolivia, which have made great disgraced speculations by thinking that they could always be smoking up.
This wasn't my strategie.
I never had a dream of universe power, said Burda.
I don't absolutely see in the role of preceptors of the country as it could be Springer and I don't want to be part of these international languages such as the Time, these companies have been very important.
Integral Beauty
All you can want to, in the matter of beauty and goodness, on hand.

And, if we have worked our body, we want to pass through the coffee room, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where it is proposed to repair rituals of hair, lightness or nutrition, all personally.
Innovation and exclusively seems to have been the words of order of this city spa, which will be opened all the days of the year of 10 to 22h.
Various decolations
Noël approaches and it's never overwhelmed to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party-work guard.
The shape of decollete, very important to value the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take account.
Here's some suggestions.
The song Fergie chose a exaggerated and very complex decollete. This is not very recommended.
Indesa and Barcelona, the electric car
The Endesa electronic company, in collaboration with the Barcelona Assembly, created the LIVE Office.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistic for Electronic Implementation) will define and coordinate the route sheet for the emergency of the electric car in the city and shall place agreements on mobility, in implementation of demarks, coordinating subventions, etc.
Furthermore, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electrical car, collect the view and work of the involved sectors.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Citys ”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will affect the emplantation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are coming to the project.
It is three cities selected by the Government, in the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the emplantation of the electric car.
The Endesa electronic company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalonia.
It is for the purpose of promoting research and technological development activities in the Catholic Community.
These recent activities are connected to energy, and in particular the energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative to which Endesa participate on the promotion of the electric car.
The company has participated in European standardization groups and has acted in a total of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero intervoked “a future of silence” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed “a future of silence” for the Spanish car industry which, mentioned, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reminded the measures launched by the Executive for the year to support the car sector.
“No competence plan of the car sector, we would have today a farming landing, closed some of our main product sites,” indicated the President of the Government.
"Because this plan and the decision of the marks to stay in Spain in a very competent sector, we can consider a future of silence for the future of this industry, which constitutes our main export sector," added.
In this regard, he reminded that the Competitivity Plan, including the Competitivity Plan for Automatic Sector (PIIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 aid companies, which have mobilized more than 3 million euros.
The Executive Board explained that this investment was also designed to develop new models as to modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also made the accent on government support measures to the application in the 2000E Plan, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automobil companies.
According to the President, this plan was allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market and contributed to a strong growth of immatriculations, which have progressed from '40 %' in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sportive spirit
Mazda hears evidence that the sport spirit is not fair with the respect of the environment.
In this case, she came to integrate Mazda3 the arrêt and launching engine, baptized i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is available only on the engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note that she had obtained in her together.
Details, the end of the vehicle, the livelihood, the conduct, the mechanic, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are noted on the new Mazda3.
In the beginning of the training position, it is expected that the first seats present an ethnomia and a great stability.
The touching of the flight is particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the total formed by the control table and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a future internal design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue colors.
This style reminds us, in particular, the Honda Civic Honda.
That is why we can say that as well as Mazda3 that Civic, both Japanese, confronts the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to overcome.
Continuing with the apartment, this Japanese compact car presents a lot more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a higher comfort level.
It is added to all this a big coffee to regular forms.
The mounting and autostart system of the engine, at least for the moment, is available only on the engine with two letters and 150 horses and with the manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. He is illustrating by his fineness, his low dream, his prestations and the manager of his consumption.
In fact, although Mazda3 is the most demanded diesel models, those who do not do a lot of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with an essential engine, as well as for its great comfort of speed and for its main consumption.
With regard to the equipment level, the selected model for the test is the Sportive, otherwise says that the most series of elements are present.
In the series equipment, the RVM assistent for the change of path (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction controls and stability, the speed regulator, the photosensible inside viewer, the board computer on a large screen size, the stickers, the independent climate, the rain and light capture, the bluetooth and the sound bluetooth routes, and the alignment of 17 puzzle routes, are particularly notable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version was available from the Pack Premium that, for 1 500 euros more, includes other components of bi-xenon adaptable farms and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best cars compacted in its category.
It is particularly expressed by the quality of materials used, by its behavior and its higher equipment level.
Furthermore, those who don't do a lot of kilometers per year can operate for the i-Stop version associated only with the engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only unconsent of this model is its high price, which is sitting between 21 770 euros for Luxury and 23 270 euros for the test model, Sportive.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction each day.
'First' of Luxembourg
L.A. Cooling the red cup of sensuality incarcerated by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
Stars have more than never blue, even elegant models, as well as sexys for Nine's exit. (Fotos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", sophisticated as usually, had chosen for a "lady" dark.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at his email, without offering the possibility, it would be only to see some kind of attachments or shipping on the Internet.
He benefits from his five minutes of glory in the United States, when the Time magazine designs it as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it's more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to Smartphones, Peek offers a price and a very low monthly subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone subscription date.
Considering its success, the company started two new devices: one design exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life-date service, for six times more loving than Peek.
FunPeek, presented yesterday in the event The Web, is the European version of invention and its third incarnation.
It's all too limited as his grand-friend American, but it's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, including the roaming in all Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what represents the fact of renewing the data when it passes through a border or finds unexpectedly a coffee on the Wifi (or a Background connection) to visit the e-mail.
The idea of a roaming to a fixed price is increasingly seducing, and it makes it a long time it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but I would have needed to make a physical threat to understand them and to read the small characters.
Recommendations to the European Commission's repeated order to propose attachable roaming tariffs in all Europe have been a perceptible effect.
In the outside of its origin country, we are steadfast to use the data, and we have not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is still curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow their data networks to rehabilitate.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no guarantee.
It is a connected device and it is paid during its accusation and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: an acceptable option with living access like Peek proposes it already to the United States.
I don't want to buy it.
I'm looking at my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more simple formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
The favorite colour of Michelle
The yellow is, of course, the precious color of the first lady of the United States.
If she has been taken to Barack Obama's function to the President of the United States with a cloud and a cloud of this colour, she has actually chosen the same to join it in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of her life: the delivery to Oslo of the Nobel Price of the Peace.
Michelle Obama brought a very similar model in these two occasions: outside their similar color, a yellow shooting to the green with brilliant reflets, both times, the tree was composed of three pieces: clothes, clothes and clothes, in the same tissue, and was organized with a large brodery or a collar.
Although the first point of eye, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows the challenge of the Princess of Asturians and had chosen to restore the same tensions.
But the pressure in which both together are tailed is very different.
If for the functioning capture it was a white dental, at least, she brought an printed speed to Oslo.
Accessories are also different: green shoes to tattoo means for the first occasion, and a similar model, but worth this time.
She also changed: the hairs are now lifted up while she brought them the previous time.
75% of the mothers working have been professional problems because of their mothership
The discrimination on the work has increased during the last years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
That is what the study “Fecondity and Professional Carrier of Women in Spain” is made by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The investigation, conducted by 9 737 women of 15 to 75 years, does not take place in doubt: 75% of the mothers who worked have seen their limited professional carrier because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences on the beginning of life in couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the type of employment.
Those who don't have activity outside the family, work in part-time or have a little stabil work, get their first growth early, and have more children.
However, women have a stabil employment, mainly in public sector, reject the entertainment of life in couple and the first growth, and have less children.
The women between 35 and 49 years have their first child, in the middle of 3,7 years after they were installed in couple. This number is 4,1 in those who work in the public sector. "There are shown that women with a stabil employment have needed more time in their life to get it, which brings them to repeat the union and the achievement of children.
Furthermore, the type of employment affects the maternity, but less the date of common beginning of life," explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado researcher.
The level of study is another factor that increases the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the higher training level is higher, more they married and their first child later.
The differences are also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher studies were respectively mothers for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years in average.
“ Another discipline appears also between women, according to their study level.
While those who have committed elementary studies married and have their first child before finding a stabil employment, those who have been carried out of average level or higher studies inverted this programme and give priority to obtain a stabil work as a preliminary conditions for marriage and to the arrival of a child, Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger too well
The Oreal Paris has come to add a new name to his rolled list of embassy: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German act will incarcer the image of several products of the mark, intended to the universal devise “Cause I am well.”
The Protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, came also to join other celebrations in the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before she, the last ones to penetrate in this club if select were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Milionary).
In men, the cosmetic mark also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lectures) and Matthew Fox (the Evangeline company in Lost).
The prices of the British mode
The British have many to say in the world of mode.
His greatest representatives, creators and mankins, yesterday and today, were gathered together for the annual reward of their price, which was placed in London, the Kingdom Court of Justice.
Nobody missed you.
The old mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chose better mannequin in the year.
Manuel Vincent As Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker of Ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-three "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not according to the previsible and apprehensive types (biographical, life and work), but looking for something similar to the creation of the person's innition.
The travel is exciting and Vincent doesn't compare the frayers or lights.
Beautiful to please, this book is also an emotional invitation to reading and releature.
I'll leave you here some moments.
On Albert Camus : “In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, even that I felt without the name: the pleasure against the famous destination, moral without guilty and unbelieving without any god.”

A lack of agression
The last week, my mother, who had about 70 years, went to our town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young men between 15 and 18 years passed near her and our dog, a blood-mole, saved from the SPA and not over six kilos, and without a word, sent to him two pieces of feet that left the hungry severely hurts.
Our wrath is great because we don't see what is amusing to avoid freely a little without defense which, in addition, was left.
It is necessary to add the instruction of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she injured these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks a animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, a older or, in definitive, every man lower than he.
The episode was located to 17 hours, a martyr like another, in a regularly quiet quarter.
The dog's got all the day.
We have heard clearly deposited the commissariat of the quarter, even if we doubt that it serves a big-hose and not to touch the feelings, we just want to determine that the killers were Spanish.
The instruction has brought us to deny this fact.
We don't understand what happens in the young people so that they're happy to distract freely a wild animal that gives us love, friendship, and holds us company.
We don't know where the good education and respect of animals and persons has passed.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the ship port
The Michelin Pneus, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for the Road Security (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encouraging the port of the case, mainly in the youngest motorists, as the two structures have indicated today.
This initiative has to be aware of the importance of the case port, since it is the only protection element that allows to escape worms to the head, or even death, in case of accident in two roads.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in the line of its commitment to the road safety, which “after the concept and the manufacture of products are still more safe” and indicated that it contributed to this objective by other pedagogical and informal actions.
This new campaign of encouraging the port of the box in two roads, under the "To be or not to be", will be the first phase during which the shows will be distributed in more than 500 motorcyclet guarantees to ensure the largest diffusion.
Finally, Michelin submitted that the road safety is a constant concern for the company, because as a manufacturer of pneumatics for vehicles at two roads, one of its main objectives is to develop more safe products.
Progressive sale of lower trade vehicles
After nearly two years, the market of light trade vehicles begins to see a little light on the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles immatricized in November in Spain represents a increase of 12,6% in relation to 2008 and, as important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive reduction, according to the numbers of the patronal syndicate of Anfac and Ganvam, the consecutive manufacturers.
However, the good news should note, since the reference of the comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a reduction of 60 % in relation to the previous year.
Thus, although the rebound of the last month, immatriculations accumulated during these 11 months are 40 % under the previous exercise.
Since January, all vehicles are added to the category of light trade vehicles (tourism cars, pick-up, firegonnets, light cars and driving rooms) 95 853 were sold.
Great clouds that affect their demand are not so disagreed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or average enterprises, which pay at nearly 100 % of the cases by a external finance.
Thus, in addition to restrictions imposed by the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase of the taxing level or the sustainance of the bad economic conjunction.
In the case of this situation and the differences of tourism vehicles, the 2000E's achievement assistance has not been served.
Furthermore, independents, and PMEs who want to buy a lower trade vehicle less than 3,5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that do not exceed 160 grams to kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speak of itself.
Yesterday, in Ganva, the need for administration was to take particular attention to these vehicles and also to industry vehicles (camions and buses).
Association of consensors provides a similar year to the end of 2010, for which it calculates a smoking of the ventures (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
The aid to urgent railway is now obligated
As this occurred with the anti-blocking system of ABS and as it will be placed with the ESP stability control, the aid systems for urgency railway will be an obligatory element on European cars.
They are also already obligated on tourism cars and newly immaterial trade vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of carence was fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union is to strengthen the protection of the pioneers, even if, by its action mode, it can also contribute to avoid many backs.
The assistant to the urgency railway acts by increased pressure on the franks in case of urgency detected by the system through the feet given by the driver.
But this last doesn't always keep pressure until the end.
Following a study made by Bosch cars composers, one third of the drivers involved in a accident could not support the french before collision, and half of them did not benefit from all his strength.
Before 1100 accidents
The aid intervention requires the maximum fresh system, reducing the distance where the car needs to stop.
According to a EU study, if all cars were equipped from that type of elements, until 1 100 death accidents in which pioneers were infected each year.
This reduction would be more important with the popularization of intelligent urgency systems: it is calculated that a left on four with wounds would be disappeared.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped from a system that, through a radio or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver to act easily on the branches.
If the driver reacts, he will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if it is necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the franks to minimize the damage.
General Motors repeated until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM), that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – after Javier Ortega, the North-American manufacturer warning that he would need more time to conclude Opel's safe plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of Europe, hears that each point of the plan has been approved by the concerned party.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and governments of the countries where the uses are found, will be reported until the beginning of 2010.
However, in GM, we are sure that a decision on sale of Saab should be taken in the next days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Sweden Government has restricted the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision faster.
GM admits to be contacted with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also encourages to acquire Volvo, but the candidate of the Hollandian Sport Skyper car cars, supported by the Russian Converg Group, takes an importance.
In the case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sold a part of Saab to Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the flight of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To conceal their last and precious bottles, the porsche engineers have gone from the Boxster S and have succeeded to advance it from less than 80 kilos, which leaves the balance only 1275 kilos.
This caused them to pass, in the first place, from the automatic tooth which was replaced by a manually built tooth, allowing to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium gates such as GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the climate, 13 kilos, to reduce the reserve of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gain, to mount sport bacchets, yet 12 kilos, and with 19 pounds lengths, five kilos.
Finally, they renewed the audio CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replaced the poigneous doors by tissues, economising the remaining kilos.
Although the model also exists with the PDK box with double embryo, the test was made on a manual box of six speeds, mainly on the routes of the secondary network in California, in the mountain, with particular torturable virgins.
His behavior can only be qualified of irreprochable.
The reduction of the weight does not exceed the car to roll on the ground with aplomb.
In contrast, it was a long time we didn't test a small and lower model that, at the same time, guarantees so much security in virgins, including in large speed.
It's a small athlete, able to explore his little muscle speed during the time needed, until we asked him to print, break, get and pull his engine again...
That's what we want, thanks to his direction, both communicative and specific, the car will do what we will indicate our hands on the flight.
And she will do it with a chirurgical precision.
Volunteer Engine Sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S), is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" option or with a system that changes the motor rushing, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, which is at the stop or in receipts.
The suspensions are closed, but not hard or incomfortable.
The clothing of the routes we traveled with Boyxster Spider was too busy, but the car was well controlled the ball nids.
Electronic assistants make a lot of presence on all the treatment, while on some virgins we found the smoke at the morning and the branches later in the morning.
Finally, a ultraleger car, most amusing to drive and that is more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be carried out in February 2010 to a price of 70 831 euros.
“ Bag Girl ”
Amy intime of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Coco Cocoon line and an opportunity starlet of the house's defilers, the song shows his face of bad girl with so much containing as his Canel sacks.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral has received a triomphe in 91-82 when he visited on the argue land of Maccabi Electra, although many absences that would suffer the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She was sitting in the head of his group, after the great spectacle of Mirza Teletovic, who, with eight patterns to three points, was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
The Vitoria team fulfilled the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of engagement and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to bring the victory.
Moreover, the great habileness from the period, with 16 pairs to three marked points, determines the final victory.
The match started quickly for blue and red, which took the advance from the beginning.
The fact that the four first paniers of Vitoria team were marked since the period, the fact that they were saved on the Israelite land with the hot pounds.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 final of the first fourth time.
The second fourth time was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the inner game of Barak and Elijahu's work, which was received by exclamations and approvals to return to his old house, to increase their benefits to the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to be noted as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the "minute six" evaluation of Splitter had already been predicted that this night would not be the best of Brazil.
But in this evening, although they were on the right path to the break, nothing was played away from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that we won't so easily on their grounds, and through the "the hand of Elijah," they succeeded to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed to a decision that yellows take advance on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The Ivanovic gamers, who were hurt but far from being dead, had needed to take a few habile actions to take the air, and it is at the moment that the Mirza Teletovic mirailette, which, with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, rejected the counter to a rare score (54-67), and that the locals succeeded to accent at the end of the third quarter time (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they wouldn't let anyone take them what they had measured during the thirty-first minutes.
However, Pni y Eidson, the best of their teams, did not resign and tried to support it from the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for sins, Ivanovic players did not prejudice, defend well, and even though the Israelites were closed in the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory was cut out to Tel Aviv for the first time of the saison.
The wounds stop the Unix to deliver the battle
Unicaja lost brutally in Greece faced Olympiacos and ceased him the head of the B group of Europe, in a match marked by the missing players of Unicaja, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been explored by the environment of the peace and the Amitic Pavillon and the River Inverter, of course one of the most powerful Europe and has a large budget.
The first four-time game was allowed to dream the dreams. A aggressive defense and three consecutive points, two of Mr. Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who explored the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to turn the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when a action, a start of bagar, between the North American Beverley and Williams, the disqualiation of the two players.
The Greek team started working by showing his highestness in the two camps, while the outcome of the angle pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal sins of Carlos Jimenez was wounded on Unicaja.
The internal players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas, with their pants at three points, increased 44-32, at the nineteenth minute.
Unable to mount
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, although 19 losses, showed up and even appeared to be equal to the differences of the meeting discussed in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, able to succeed the head of the group.
Unicaja tried to surround the absences and the last out of the school pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Although all these problems, UNICAGE, thanks to his organization, at Cook's 3 points, and on Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-eighteen-minute minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos showed unplayable when the players pressed and showed their highest in centimeters in the area.

Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's department
The Brazilian Government has fixed a period for Manuel Zelaya's residence in his ambassade of Tegucigalpa.
The Reverse President should leave diplomatic legislation later on 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, carrier of businesses from Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed at the Globo TV that "Mel" knows that he must leave the campaign, where he is refugeed since 21 September, before that date.
“He has aware that he must leave on January 27, after his command, he must look for another destination. ”
The chain also cited the old mandator, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the time set: “My position is to leave the fastest possible, logically with the support of the Government of Brazil,” said Zelaya by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (for which Perfirio Lobo was chosen), Zelaya ensures that he would stay in Brazil until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation has finally failed, since Zelaya refused the conditions of political exemption that he heard to impose the government of fact before Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After red days since the last presence, during which the inflation of activity has constituted the dominant note on the market, the insurance is reached again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in a middle where the agents take decisions on an incertain nature.
The remedie used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetate the debt by the direct achievement of active and indirectly by giving liquidity at near zero levels, so that the financial institutions can take a mobilising activity.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct achievements of activity have been practically completed and, without reforming their non-conformist policy of liquidity, began to put a little smoke in the roads, such as the ECB, with their adjudication for a year of the next week.
Thus, investors do not doubt the capacity of global economy to maintain an economic relationship without herodox measures, and we are intended to assist the reduction of risk prices.
The volatility of the bowls and the cutting of the obligations of the enterprise is again increased, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they have arrived at the beginning of the year.
The States have seen that the private risks were socialised and the public debt is again affected.
There is again an impact on the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugees chosen by investors, caused to increase differences between the European area and Germany.
Spanish was increasingly touched by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor'sa was threatened from a new revision to the low quality of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little incertainty is not bad to make the defenders of the moral risk, which were trying to renew a conscious case in the responsible for the world economic policy that had broken the effects of the destruction of the credit on the destruction of the employment, while it was necessary to describe a new day of thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's situation seems to be a tribal fight between the emergency to replace its position to the power in the emigrants and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that designs a public deficit, elections, and a new government that finds the pocket in the roses.
Provided it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duram Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saved Hungary from non-response of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a Member State of the euro area to not respect its commitments.
In contrast, the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to transparency and makes its respective citizens the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced to an episode of normalization of transit risk prices, after some excess in high positions, it would be preventable.
In the case of Spanish, as our public debts are increased in the measure of European companies, we do not have to be concerned.
If the European escapes decreased and that ours continue to increase, it would be an idiosyncrasic risk of Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's Affair is an anecdote. When our previsional indicators require the majority of studies to prevent their relationship models and to review their previsions for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the load with a Japanese model for Spanish economy, it does not increase much hope for their warning.
Once again, it looks like to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish activists, even if “proudness is a mother of sure.”
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galan, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommission of the Deputy Congress, where the Spain energy strategy is discussed for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galan was excused for the press that he had said before the subcommission.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and 60 million more between that date and 2030, where nuclear centres are currently open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not exceed 60 million but 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be sanctified by the increase of production capacity, but for distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changed, and it must increase the power.
His couple also focuses on gas centres and carbon, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, in particular, renewable energys.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more needs, with other “aid energy”.
Galan, who estimates that the draft of sustainable economies that the Government comes to approval is in the line of what his company claims, did not want to attack the royal decree to encouraging the consumption of national carbons, which contradicts the climate refusal policies.
According to him, there is “a long-term pari” in this meaning, although the "pontals" measures, as the President of Iberdrola qualified.
Whatever it is, Galan believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, should be taken, because they have a certain time before they get their maturity and that a stabil framework is necessary to draw them up.

Activate its first author in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
It acts for her first author in concesion in Australia, market on which she already works as an energy and water manager company.
The chain in the game is a tunnel estimated to 1 700 million Australian dollars (by approximately 1 047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and German Hochtief company are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 miles long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Action to establish in the country as a public and consensional companies of authors.

The Australian market of infrastructures promises great challenges and privacy, but there is a great difficulty, if it is not by the way of acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategie that follows Hochtief and Bilfinger's businesses, already mentioned, including their Asian references, and remains a non-valid step for Spanish managers of the sector.
ACS has been able to conquer a place on this market by its participation of 30% in Hochtief, Leighton owner.
Millennium Activity
Actions on a geographic air of the most important for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence by the intermediary of its energy provider and the desaling sector.
In other cases, it has a largest park of oil, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies loaded to energy and management Adelaïd's dealings, with a budget of 700 million.

It is the biggest project to reduce the enhancement of trafic in Brisbane.
The calendar established by the administration indicates that adjudication will be placed during 2010 and that the works will be started in December of the next year.
While the fact that this penalty path will be opened at the end of 2014, it is not determined that the chain will be completed before 2016.

A amendment of 63 million in France Telecom to raise competition
The French competition regulator infected an amendment of 63 million euros in France Telecom for its anti-concurrents in the Caribbean region.
Following this institution, the operator limited the competition on the fixed and mobile telephone by the signature of exclusive agreements, by tarifs and programmes of faith to consumers in margin of regulation.
With this sanction, the old French monopole and still statistical business accumulates more than 450 million euros in amendments since 1994, because of the obstacles he put to his competitors.
The infliged sanction has also been increased because the authority that ensures competition consists that France Telecom has committed similar infractions in the past and that it is therefore resolved.

Their participation to the Ligue of Chambers reported 476,4 million in the Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Chamber of Chambers became a source of income for clubs since her birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467,4 million, which placed them in the third and fifth position of the clubs who have attached the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is in the head of the list.
Manchester United is in the head of the list.
It is also one of the major income sources of large clubs.
In fact, the competition shared 5362,5 million euros to 105 teams (with Spanish 12), which participated in the event since the creation of the tour, during the saison 1992-1993, according to the EUFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for his participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has tricked the tropeee.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winter of the Old Coupe of Europe in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
In the list, the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, in addition, made the most money for their participation in the last Ligue of Champions.
And that, although they lost the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, regarding the money reported by the Ligue of Chambers, although she had brought more titles than any other (5, while Italy had been carried out four, English three and Germany two).
Department
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex distribution procedure of the money applied by the EUFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's organism was proposed to win 1 090 million through the Ligue of Champions.
From this sum, the EUFA will offer 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participated in the classification matches (in which Madrid Atletics) received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who have successfully participated have received 3,8 million only to be there, more than 55000 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth-end end are three million, eight teams that arrive at the end of the fourth end received 3,3 million.
The four last teams will receive each four million.
And the campion will win 9 million, face to 5,2 received by the other finalist.
So, in the case of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7,1 million, and at the maximum 31,2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça took 2,5 million to have submitted the Super Coup of Europe in August.
But in addition there are variable payments, which are dedicated to 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and there is four attached places.
The campaign of the previous year takes 40 % of the money affected, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of matches played during the editing of the current year.

Waiting, Sus continues to restructuring his direction.
In a trial to stay outside the events of acquired and going and judges of her elders, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mary Luis Jordan as an internal audit director.
A decision that makes the first woman to carry out a leader in the food business.
It is a newly created post that will directly depend on the President of the Group.
And it is not an exempt of polémic, since the company remains undermerced in the legal war for the supply of more than 230 million of Soss to the Salazar society.
Furthermore, the possibility that during the next months Sub reveal of new fund distortions cannot be discharged.
With regard to the credit to Salazar, the old councils Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriaga (CCM and Unicaja) have stated yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed about the destruction of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV allows the OPA of Pattern exception presented by Inversion Mer
The National Commission on the Market (CNMV) has allowed the OPA of exclusive exception present by Investora Meer on Federico Paternina last 9 October.

New tools for cars experts
In those bad days and accidents, car garages are not only winning.
Each day, thousands of carriers who have gone up a left are returned to a guarantee, where an expert must assess the summary degrees and the cost of the reparation.
Each left is different, and the calculation of the costs and the time of work can be a long and complex work.
Calculating the cost of a reparation included between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and work hands can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the most recent information tools, it would be a question of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the assessment and maintenance are achieved in the collection of information provided by the manufacturers, to then treat them and offer them to their clients under a useful tool.
