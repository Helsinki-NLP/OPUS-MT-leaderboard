The members of the Gale's assembly worried because "They identify as Muppets"
Other members of the assembly have expressed its consternation before the proposal of amendment of its title for MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Parliament).
This polemic has round the plan to change the name of the assembly for the Parliament's galles.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may be a motive of burla.
One member of the worker party said that at his party he was concerned about the fact that MWP was "ried with Twp or Pwp".
For readers that are not gallesos: In galles, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Partie Plaid Cymru assembly commented that the joint of his party "not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
By his band, a member of the gallesh conservator stated that his group was shown "open" before the name change, but he also commented that there was too small differences between the MWP and "Muppet".
In this context, we need to say that the "w" letter in gallery is speaking like the letter "u" in Yorkshire in English.
According to the committee of the Assembly committee to develop the legal crazy to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any quality to call the members of the assembly will certainly be reached in their own members."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Gal·les acts in the Gal·les Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with a wide support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Gallegian Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was described by the "Galles Members" or "WPM", the MWP option has received a larger support in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, however, the intention to assume a consensus may suspect a maldecap for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who hopes to present the legal distress on the changes in weeks.
The legislation on reforms shall include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as standards on the devaluation of its members and the design of the Committee's system.
The members of the Assembly shall celebrate the final vote on its nomination during the debate related to legislation.
Makedonians will vote in reference to their country's name
The citizens will choose day-day if they want or not to change their country's name for the "North Macedonian Republic".

Athens has insisted during the force of time in the fact that the name of its north vision represents a way to recall its territory and has repeatedly opposed the efforts of this country to form part of the EU and OTAN.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebisite of the name change, has stated that he will ignore the vote.

St. Martin's campaigns leave to sound: the difficulties of Harlem's churches
"Historyly, the great people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every single," says Mr. Adams.
"I've seen in the day, I don't stay, of the two."
According to Adams, the loss of bars can come to understand.
"The people have another way to socialize today," says.
"The bars have already left that kind of sales to be for the vineyard where people were going perpetually."
He's worried that the money that gets from the sale of activity doesn't stay as much as they prevent their leaders "and that after or time they're back to the place where they're gone."
The churches, adding, could have finished without replacement by apartments and condominies with the type of people who will not be helpful for the temples that remain in the bar.
"The greatest majority of people who buy condominies in these buildings will be white race," says, "and so what they will be able to accelerate the closement of all churches, because it's all unprobable that most of the people who are transferred to these condominies will feel members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the church of Metropolitan Community on 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white methodist congregation that was originally departed during the 30 years.
A black congregation that was near, built the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed on the hands of a black congregation leadered by John Howard Johnson, who led a boxer to minor traders from the street 125th, one of the main trading streets of Harlem, which was resisted to contract or promote black race people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious Danys to the building, and when the happiness of the reverent Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they loaded the carrill.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his follower in St. Martin's church, described all honourable the carrillo as "the campaigns of the poor people."
The expert who made a sound of the carrillol of July described it differently: "A cultural threat" and "unreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, observed also that it was the first carrier of the world that was touched by a black race music, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the biggest carrier of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What you sounded at St. Martin's during the last months, in contrast, were the complicated history of architec and contractors, some of them brought by the lack leaders of the church and others for the episcopal dioses.
The advice, the rector organ of the parroquia, formated by lack leaders, wrote to the diocese the past month of July, expressing its concern that the diocese "the deocese would "the costs" to the advice, although this last was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocesis sent.
Some happiness have been broken from the lack of transparency by the diocesis.

Sainsbury's plans, on the market of the United Kingdom's beautiful products
Sainsbury's decided to make competence in Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beautiful products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.

Sainsbury's states that he will double your beauty offer to offer to 3000 different products, including for the first time marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing games of the Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more spaces with mark areas similar to those that can be found in boats like Boots.
The supermarket company is also located in the range of its range of Boutic Machine products so that most of the products are now appetits for vegans, a view of each more demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's boots. The first week has done it in Croydon, South London, while the second will open Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
They're buying them by Internet and changes a way to buy food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made great supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the boots will seem like a few large stores in a temptation of the supermarket string to fight the Aldi and Lidl overseers with more services and no food products.
Sainsbury's went to introduce Argos' sales points to many of his supermarkets, more than a number of Habitat bottles since he buyed all two cades ago, which, what, comments, has served to raise the sales and increase the reward of the acquisitions.
The previous intention of the supermarket string to roll their departments of beautiful and pharmacist was resulting in a fraction.
Sainsbury's made a test of operation together with Boots at the beginning of the decade of 2000, but everything ended immediately when he didn't agree how to share the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain in the supermarkets.
This new strategy up after sale three years ago by Sainsbury's business 281 pharmacists in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a major role on the global plan, because he will expand the gamma of product luxury for the ball, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four bottles.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, comments: "We have transformated the view of our beautiful products in order to improve the face environment to our clients.
We have invested specific formats of workers that will be a great help at the time of offering assistance.
Our brand gamma is designed to adapt to any need; otherwise, the attractive environment and the practical location makes that we are now one of the prefered destinations for beautiful products and that we disappear the traditional way to buy."

The Cromwell state of the British Parliament was the last monument affected for the discussion around "rewrite history"
His disappointment would be a kind of poetical justice for destroying the most cleanest style of the Talibans of many cultural and religious objects of England perpetrated by their pure fanatics followers.
However, Cromwell Society described the proposal of Crick as a "bogeria" and a "intention to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the department of states, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell before the Palace of Westminster would be one of the main objectives.
The idea of the English civil wars was not ordered or ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps I would have been offering the Cromwell wrong for the actions of his preacher that he did during the past century.
The great representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the view of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe that it is worth to be commodified.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered for many, maybe more at the end of the 19th century that is not now, as a defender of the Parliament before the external pressure, in his case, obviously the monarchy.
If this fact constitutes or not a totally accepted representation a history debate.
That's true is that the medium conflict of the XVII century has conformed the last development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisible figure that represents a band of this division.
His associations like Lord Protector are also worthy to be celebrated and remembered."

A Menga game gives the victory to Livingston for 1 to 0 before Rangers
The first Dolly Menga gol with Livingston suggested the victory
Livingston, which this year was up from category, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which all right is the second destruction of Steven Gerrard in 18 parts as a trainer of the Ibrox bar club.
The Dolly Menga game marked the difference, because, with this victory, Gary Holt's team got to the second position, which shared with the Hibernian.
The Gerrards, in change, continue without winning out of the house to the Premiership this time. The next Sunday will face the leader, the Hearts, with which they separate a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers get this sauses of Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, while, extended to six parts of his rate invited to the link, with a Holt as a trainer who still doesn't know what it's the destruction since Kenny Miller replaced the past month.
Livingston does not apply his opportunities before the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone before the gol, since its direct game caused all kinds of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way between the defense, but he disappointed his occasion when he was found before the porter, and afterward, Alan Lithgow sent the pilot out to shoot himself to try to finish the past of Craig Halckett's head, who believed the porter.
In the locals it was well to let the Rangers get in his area, because they knew they could put the visitors in the island games.
And that's how this decisionful goal came.
The arbiter struck a missing against the interests of Rangers and Livingston made a opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined because Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the possession, but he was found with an immense defense and a Porter Liam Kelly who had a little job in the party,
The scenery repeated to the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a murder stop.
By his band, the Porter of Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet a case of Scott Pittman and Lithgow, a new Livingston's combination game.
Rangers was dedicated to pick up one time and another pilots in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and two penalties were rejected, one for a suspect in Holkett's replacement Glenn Middleton, and one by hands.
Livingstone "fenomenal": analyze
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great action and great results for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all the expectations of this trajectory.
His game style and personal has almost not changed from its return to the maximum category, although the largest part of the currency has to appreciate Holt for the way he has gambled the team from his top.
There was a good helicopter.
Captain Halkett was great, on the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrrell had to be a party of Menga during the whole party.
Rangers missed inspiration, however.
Although the brilliant moments with Gerrard as a trainer, they did not really know to keep the level.
They didn't know to create occasions (only one time they overwhelmed the local defense), and this Rangers, which is in the middle part of the table, should take it as a warning.

The United States should duplicate the backgrounds of the IA
“While China is more active in the ambition of artificial intelligence, the United States should duplicate the quantity of money that are dedicated to research in this field”, says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and professional specialized in artificial intelligence that worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arrive after several members of the North American Government have announced measures in AIA, although there is a general missing formal strategy in the country.
At the same time, China presented its plan in the past year: its goal is to be converted to the number 1 of the world because it's the innovation in AIA in 2030.
“Duplicating the budget in the IA research would be a good beginning, since the rest of the countries are much behind the United States and we want to be pioneers of the next adventure in the IA field,” said Lee.
“Duplicate funding could duplicate the opportunities that the United States assume the next large discovery in IA,” said Lee to the CNBC in an interview made this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Hotton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the Sinovation Ventures society, which has invested in Face++, one of the most destacated AIA companys in China.
In 1980 he worked in the Carnegie Mellon University in a IA system that overried the American player of Othello with the best classification and, afterward, executed as executed in Microsoft Research and as President of the Chinese Surveillance of Google.
Lee raised positively technical competitions before the North American Government, as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency of Defence Advanced Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when he had the next place to identify the next visions.
“Soon, the North American researchers have to work hard to get public drinks,” she declared Lee.
According to Lee, "The Chinese is not the Academy Leaders; they are businesses."
In the last years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have contracted universities to work in the IA camp.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the IA ambition could also be seen impulsed with changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should be offered automatically of residence cards in permanent residence to the doctors in IA," added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its draft development plan for artistical intelligence of the last generation.
“The National Fund of Natural Sciences of China allows funds to persons of academic institutions in the same way as the foundation of natural sciences and other public organizations of the United States give money to North-American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is less than China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States created a Conjunto Conjunt Artificial Intelligence Center, conceived because they participate in collaborators of the industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the constitution of a Committee Selection of Artificial Intelligency.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million USD in an initiative called AI Next.
For the foundation of Natural Sciences, now is more than 100 million US in the year in the IA research.
However, months ago there is no measure in relation to the North-American legislation that would like to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Makedonians target a reference to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a reference on the name of the “North Republic of Macedonia”, a measure that would resolve a debate that exists for decades ago with Greece, which had blocked the requests of accession of Macedonian to the European Union and the OTAN.
Greece, who has a provincie named Macedonian, understood that the name of its north vision constitutes a reclamation from its territory and has visited the OTAN and the EU.
In June, both governments came to a agreement on the new proposed name, but the nationalists suggest that the change would suffer the ethnic identity of the majority of slaughter in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has shown that he will not participate in the referendum, and a box campaign will doubt if it is at the minimum of the necessary participation of 50% because the reference is valid.
The question indicated in the reference paper is: "Is you in favor of the OTAN and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The change partys of the name, including the first Ministry Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that is the price of payment to assume the accommodation of Macedonian, one of the countries that have been created by the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organs such as the EU and OTAN.
“I have come to vote for the future of the country, because the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we all have a safe life," said Olivera Georgievska, of 79 years in Skopje.
Although it is not legally linking, a sufficient number of Parliaments has shown that it will take the result of the vote to make it decision.
In order to change the name, a majority of two thirds will be required to the Parliament.
The State electronic Commission informed that it wasn't produced any irregularity at the 13th.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% registered in the recent parlamentary elections, held in 2016, voted 66% of the registered people.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, to the capital, Skopje.
The first Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted to the referendum held in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which would open the way of accession to the European Union and the OTAN to Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, of 54 years, was preparing a small scenario and collecting frameworks before the tents installed for people who would boot the reference.
“We are for the OTAN and the EU, but we want to be attached to the high head, not for the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
“I'm a poor country, but we're worthy.
If they don't want us to accept us as Macedonian, we can return to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form a part of the European integration."
The first Ministry Zaev says that OTAN's integration will come with more investments than you needed in Macedonia, which has a rate of rate above 20%.
"I think the majority will vote, because more than 80% of the citizens are for the EU and the OTAN," said Zaev before deposit his paper.
Zaev showed that a “yeah” would suggest the “confirmation of our future”.
In a report published last weekly by the Macedonia Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of the voters participated in the referendum, a number for the minimum participation.
According to the results of another request, directed by the Macedonia Telema TV, 57% of the inquisitive states have been proposed to vote a weekend.
In these cases, 70% stated that it would vote "Yes."
Because the reference is valid, the participation must be more than 50%.
A failure in the referendum would suspect the first hard time for the west Government policy since he took the age of May of the past year.

Schercher, without options, wants to remove Rockys
With the Nationals removed from the fight for play-off, there was no reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, waiting to get out to the monkey of the ladder of the Sunday Sunday, that comes against the Colorado Rockies, if the Rockies, who keep an advance party on Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National Library, have the opportunities to play the play-off.
The Rockies were ensuring a complaint with the winter of 5 to 2 against the Natives Friday night, but they still try to get their first division title.
"Which we don't play anything, at least we can go out to explore the environment that is here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably discuss each point at the higher level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?'
The Nationals still have to announce an offender for the Sunday, but they appear to be decided to leave Scherzer lens if this situation is married.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a fulfillment session and wearing the Sunday, on his normal relax day.
Washington's right shooter has a register of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 entered this time.
Trump makes a mesting at West Virginia
The Chairman was directly refered to the situation of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the participation of republicans in the elections of half of mandate.
“ Everything we did is playing on November.
Five weeks for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the greatest, great. I don't present myself, but actually I'm present. That's why I'm fighting for the fantastic candidates."
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, terrible democratic group now.
They are decided to restore power for all the needed media, seeing their massage, their bad intention.
It doesn't matter those who do bad, for whom they have to go to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not giving them."
The mission of the democratics, he said, "Restauring and destroying."
"And this can be seen in the past four days," he rebelled, and titled the democratics of "inutates, maskins, brutes and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the Democratic Senator of rang higher than the Judicial Committee of the Senate, has caused a strong public writer.
“ Remember your answer?
Have you filtered the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a moment... this was a very bad body language, the worst body language I never saw."
The Working Partie has to be a different party.
It's tolerant with those who say what they think.
When the Moment activists of my local party voted to censure me, he didn't surprise me.
At the end, I'm the last of a British Parliamentary series who told us that we're not welcome to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because it was manifested with a determination against antiism.
In my case, with the movement of censury criticed me to discreet with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of an economic policy responsible, on national security, on Europe, and Ironically, they are similar questions to whom Jeremy discussed with the previous leaders.
In the advertising of Friday meeting of the Laboratory Partie of Nottingham, it was noted that “we want to be included and productive.”
During most of my eight years, as a local laborist parliamentary, the meetings of the General Committee celebrated the Friday night have been exactly like this.
Of course, this is not the tone of many meetings, and has forgotten the political promise of “beloved and beloved”, if it is sometimes existing.
Every time it is clearer that different opinions are not tolerant to the Laboratory Partie, and each opinion is judged if it is acceptable for the direction of the Partie.
This began a little after Jeremy became the leader, because you felt with whom I thought I had shared a similar political vision that hoped that I would have been a round of 180 and have taken positions that I would never have adopted, even on national security or on the unique EU market.
When I speak in public, tell me what you say, social networks are filled with agressive messages in which a call is called because my candidate is not renewed, they are declared the centre policies and say that it should not be in the Laboratory Party.
And this doesn't just happen to me.
Actually, I know I'm more happy than some of my colleagues, because the messages I got only to be political.
I'm impressed for professionality and definition of colleges every day to face a tower of sexist and racist attacks, and they're not going.
One of the most deceptive aspects of this was political is to see how the bottom level was normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn stated the past week that the Laboratory Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The reality is that we are no longer that party so different, and with each move of "no trust" or any change in the choice standards, the game was excited more.
In the last two years I received a lot of advice, and they recommended me to keep the head low, which wasn't so explicit, and "I would be good."
But I didn't enter the policy for this.
Since I was involved in the Laborist Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, estimated by the Negligent Government of Thatcher, who left my whole class literally attached, I tried to defend a better public service for those who need it more, even as a local counsel or as a Minister of Government.
I have never hid my policy, nor only in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could doubt about my political positions and the points of agreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the dinner motion, I would tell them that in a moment when the country goes to a Brexit who will persuade the loyalty, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the Leader of the Working Partie.
But in fact, the message I want to transmit was not directed to Nottingham Moment, but to my choices, be laborists or not: I'm honourable to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of renewing my candidate or any political interest will stop to act, according to my opinion, in the benefit of the interests of all of you.

År 38 - 17 More: Any Ir Imbatuts capture the leader
Two assaults of last hour distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs enjoyed the victory in this live party of the Tenent's Premiership Day.
The Ayrs, who are the only threats of the ten, take the first position on the classification table.
At the end, the local team was instructed thanks to his defense superiority and the fact that he knew to appreciate the opportunities better, and the trainer Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The parties we played until now have been tested and we still continued to build, so I have to be happy," said.
Robyn Christe, of the Melrose, said: “Enhorabona for the Ayrs, they have approved the best occasions than we.”
Grant Anderson's attack on 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put forward to the Ayrs, but a big card for the international scotch Rory Hughes, ceiding for the game for Warrios, allowed the best to apply the numberary highest, and Jason Baggot announced an unconverted attack.
Climo expanded the advance of the Ayr with a sanction and, just in the middle part, announced and turned a assault to put the 17-5 marker for the Ayr's relax.
But Melrose started the second part and the attack of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Afterward, the party was interrupted for a long time because of the severe lesson that suffered Ruary Knott, who was removed in a letter, and at the repression the Ayrs returned to expand the distance with a assault of Stafford McDowall converted to Climo.
Following, Captain Blair Macpherson was attached to a big card, and, again, Melrose approved the higherness of a man more with an unconverted assault of Bruce Colvine at the end of a strong pressure moment.
However, the local team reacted, and when Struun Hutchinson saw a big card to make a place to Climo without pilot, since the sanction alignment, MacPherson announced a confrontation behind the penetrant wall of the Ayr.
Climo marked, as he had done it almost from the repression, after Kyle Rowe collected a joke of David Armstrong and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to announce the five assaults of the local team.
The star of the Serial Still Game seems to be at point to start a new carrier in the restauration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Serial Still Game, seems to be at the point to go to the hostal sector, after they discovered that it was named director of a restaurants with licence.
Actor, 56 years old, interpret Jack Jarvis's personality to the popular BBC series, who writes and co-protection with Greg Hemphill, his social partner for a long time.
The two announced that the nine-time will be the last of the series, and Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make no comments on respect, although a source of the journal The Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan had the intention to enter the "Florent sector of the restauration" of Glasgow.
"The sea is our," Bolivia, without literal, waiting for the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
The mariners are patrusted for their ship covered by the ship to the Peace.
Public buildings built a blue color band.
The ship bases from Titicaca to Amazons are empathy with the lema: "The sea is our right.
Recover it is an obligation."
Out of Bolivia without literal territory, the record of a lost cost before Xile in a cruel resource conflict in the 19th century remains very wide, as the angel is to go back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the most deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue the 1 October after five years of liberation.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unit and serenity, and, don't need to say, wait with a positive position of the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a bolivia diplomatic.
Many boliviaans will look at the TIJ resolution in large boards around the country, with the hope that the Court of the Haia described for the reputation of Bolivia that, after decades of intermitting conversions, Xile is obligated to negotiate the concession of a sovereign outcome to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the indigenous Carismatic President of Bolivia, who faces a political battle for the re-elektion of the year that he sees, also has many hopes in the resolution of Monday.
“We are very close to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised the past August.
However, some analists think that it is impossible that the Court decides for Bolivia and that, if it does, things would not change much.
The organization of the United Nations based on the Netherlands has no power to juice the southern territory and has established that it will not determine the results of the possible conversions.
The TIJ resolution, which is produced only six months after the final annexes, indicates that the case “not was complicated”, stated that China's specialist in international law.
And far from seeing a favour, Bolivia's cause could have experienced a back-up in the last four years.
“The current Bolivia Administration has closed the question of access to the sea,” said Zerate.
“The Bellegant Retory of Morales has granted every gesture of good will by Xile”, suggested.
Bolivia and Xile will continue to talk at some time, but it'll be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two nations were not interchanged from 1962.
The previous President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in La Haia, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was exclusively quickly quick.
The next Sunday Bolivia will have “a extraordinary opportunity to begin a new time of relationship with Xile” and an opportunity to “the end of 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who continued to feel one of the most popular Presidents in Latin America, had been using the maritime issue as political cross.
“Bolivia will never reject its right to access to the Pacific Ocean”, added.
"Resolution is an opportunity to indicate that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarma will not be produced as long as I can trust the United States
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Afers, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation will not remove nuclear weapons if you can't trust Washington.
Ri talked on Saturday past in the United Nations General Assembly.
The Ministry instructed the United States to keep the promises held during a circle celebrated in Singapore among the leaders of the two river countries.
His statements will come in a moment when the state secretary of the United States, Mike Pompeo, is going to retract the nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the circle celebrated in Singapore with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong One.
He says that it's a chemical thinking that the continuous sanctions and the objection of the United States to a statement that will end in the Korean War can make the North Korea never aghenol.
Washington disappears to accept the statement if Pyongyang doesn't make important disarmament movements.
Kim and the President of North America Donald Trump want to celebrate a second circle.
However, there is a generalism on the fact that Pyongyang is seriously taken the question to renew an arsenal that the country considers the only average to ensure its safety.
Pompeo has previously visited Pyongyang next month to prepare a second circle between Kim and Trump.
Paris's mode defilations show the last gamma of large size bars, path to a main road near you
If you want to increase the size of your bars collection, or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look for more.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a gamma of extravagant dimensions of their SS19 collection, which turned the style defined in the Paris Mode week.
This is the Instagram has seen a lot of practical bars, and these designers have brought their wonderful creatures to the travel.
The destacated piece of Valentino was a exagerate beast bart, adorned with a wide hair, with a plome form, which injured the head of the models.
In the middle of other overdimensionated accessory, there were joyful syndromes, a brushed bar, and even a penny, but these are not designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strategic masks, just for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of living colors, had slides and seemed more than Hannibal Lecter than no high curve.
A creation was like a full submarinism team, with tubs and eggs, while another seemed like one with flat bleeding.
And if you follow the big tendency of the mode, you're lucky.
Steel observators predict that the great bars could be able to explore in the main streets near you.
The large dimension bars throw the balls of the Bomba, a ball bar, with a lot of two foots, which everybody has taken from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The label of worship behind the board so little practical that was scattered through social networks brought another great creation to the ship: a ball box for the board, almost great as the model clothed with the banner that took it.
The raphy box, of dark dark shirt, adorned with raphy shirts and finished with a white kitchen kitchen, was the destacated piece of the collection The Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus at the week of the Paris Moda.
The named Luke Armitage stylist said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see people bringing big bars and woods on the main streets the next street. While the designer had a great impact, it would be a lot that would ignore the request of great size accessors.
John Edward: language competences are essential for world citizens
Independent schools keep a trajectory of academic excellence that continued in 2018 with another series of excellent tests, which will be strengthened with the individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 300,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scope Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer a best level service to students and parents.
Independent schools have a goal to prepare students for later and high schools, for the carrying and for their place as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school course, we observe that modern languages continue to feel a very popular and desired election material in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, you will come to his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we can't depend on English if we want to establish relations and generate confidence with people of other countries.
From the recent results of the analysis of the range, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with highest qualities in independent schools.
The 68% of the students who studied foreign languages received the A above.
The data collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS were reflected that 72% of the students received a higher quality in Mandari, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received a A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are supported to stranger languages as vital competences that children and young people will need doubt in the future.
Today, languages, as the election assignment, are maintained in the same consideration as the STEM assignments (Science, Technology, Ingegnery and Mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and other places.
An inquisition implemented in 2014 for the United Kingdom Office and Competencies declared that for the reasons that the companies gave them to the fact that they costed to cover their vacants, 17% was assigned to the missing of language competences.
Therefore, language competences are always more essential to prepare young people for their future courses.
Since every time there are more potential work opportunities required languages, these competences are essential in a globalised world.
Independently from the carrier that a person chooses, if he has a second language, he will have a real benefit in the future with a permanent competence like this.
The fact that the power to communicate directly with people of other countries has automatically put a multilinguish person in the presence of competition.
According to an inquisition implemented in 2013 for YouGov between more than 4000 adults of the United Kingdom, 75% could not speak enough foreign languages as well as to maintain a conversation, and the French, with a 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double number percentage.
For this reason, investment in language teaching is important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially developed economys, you will give children the best opportunities to find an important work.
In Scotland there's difference between schools for the languages they're teaching.
Some schools are focused more in modern traditional languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, to 2020, as the mandatory or Japanese.
Continue to be your son's interest, he will always choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which count with special teacher personal in this area.
Independent schools are dedicated to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children and give them from the needed competences to have success, independently of what will be done in the future.
In the global trade environment of the current time, it cannot be rejected that languages continue to have a significant importance for the future of the country, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “in international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young schools.
We need to do it well.

LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The hope is practically finished for the guys who want to see LeBron James to play his first party with Los Angeles Lakers.
The Leader of Lakers, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play the first part of pre-temperature against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to determine the minutes you'll play.
"They are more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official place of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a journalist of the Lakers, killed that James probably will play a few minutes.
After the training of the beginnings of this week, James asked about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers' pre-time party.

Muting de Trump to West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a campaign activity tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five programmed terms of Trump for the next week, including visits to sympatient sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for his candidate to cover the vacant of the Supreme Court is in wait, Trump is expected to achieve support for the next half-management elections, since the republicans are the risk of losing the control of the Congregation when votes are emerged in November.
In what hour is Trump's measurement in East Virginia tonight and how can you see in line?
Trump Meting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is programmed for the 19th hours today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's measurement to West Virginia can be seen on line on the link that is then specified through direct video transmission by YouTube.
Trump is likely to approach the audience started this week with the candidate named by the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which was held because of sexual abuse accusations against which it is concerned, while the vote of confirmation proposed by the Senate was waited for a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this meditation once is to help the republicans who are present in the delicate elections of November to cover impulse.
Thus, the five measures in the campaign of the President Trump programmed for the next week are directed to “estimulate volunteers and sympatits, while the republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities that have in the Senate and the Representative Chamber, according to Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to a number of states as possible, while we are leaving to a traveled campaign,” he signed a Trump port that refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
The meditation of this night, programmed in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather sympathians 'd'Ohio and Pennsylvania, and cover the media of Pittsburgh', according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited the West Virginia, the state where he won for more than 40 percentual points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, which is obtaining some unfavorable results in the encounters.
“It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President should come to give him a impulse in the inquiries,” commented Simon Hader, the Politologist of the East Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North-American team shows its ambition to maintain lives in the individual parts of Sunday
After three disappointed sessions, the Saturday Fourths at the late was probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculating pendules of the dynamic is a invented sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So what side is the positive dynamic now?
"They have a benefit of six points and now is four, so I think we're in a little positive rat," said Jordan Spieth while I went to the end of the journal.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points forward, with twelve more games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind smokes a little for their favor and have many reasons to be animated, in a large part of the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both counted three points of four.
Spith has been lital from the tea to green and gives examples.
The joyful crits of celebration went up with intensity while he continued to turn and stayed a crucial puzzle to empathy the fourth party, when he and Thomas were two down after two bodies.
He celebrated the fuck that he won the game on the road 15 with a similar crisis, as he indicates that he believes that the American team is still not out of competition.
"You have to steal at the maximum and be worried for your own party," said Spieth.
It's all that remains in these players now.
18 boats to leave business.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unexpectable sense of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but loved European couple brings four of four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a sneak on the late Sunday, and also forbid the bogeys on Sunday at the morning and evening to the late, and the latest new ransoms on the morning.
For this result and how its energy seems to flee to and from the public bullition, it is reaffirmed that they are players at the Sunday battle, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is set on Le Golf National.
Likewise, both of us in different forests.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson finished quickly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fireballs of the morning, who made a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double at the nine first forests ran the Spanish and the Swedish in a forest that they never had any option to go out.
The Sunday, but there is no one who can help you out of the forest.
Fourballs and fires are very fascinating to see interactions between the camera, the advice that gives them and those who don't give, and how a strategy can change on once and back.
Even now, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important contribution, but this flight session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have been questioned.
Europe up to the end of Ryder Cup with a favorite bookmark of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a commode advantage after the end of the fireballs and the Saturday fires with a victory for 10 to 6 of the United States.
The inspired two formats for Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his register, at the moment, four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, Captain Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to keep the troff that lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a few American teams in sure at the fireballs of the morning and put the series in 3-1.
The United States presented more resistance to fours and won two parties, but they could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points on 12 individual parts of the Sunday to keep the trofeum.
Fleetwood is the first European debt that gets four consequent points, while he and Molinari, known with the name of "Molliwood" after a week of sensational, are only the second couple who wins four points in his first four parts in the history of Ryder Cup.
After slaughtering Woods and Patrick Reed in the fireballs, they made a brilliant action to struggle a Woods designflat and the American deputy Bryson Dechambeau for a 5 and 4 more emfatic.
Woods, who had been thrown into two parts of the sabbath party, showed spatial genialities, but he lost 19 of 29 parts in fireballs and fires, and seven consequents.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in the fireballs of the morning, made her partner with Henrik Stenson on the fours and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka, classified as first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe had not all the faces in a pleasant and winning day in South-Occident of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the campaign of the tour, and Justin Thomas established a reference point for Americans after two points.
They got a victory with 2 to 1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fireballs, and later, they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 to four, after they lost the first two bodies.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup, a team had a difference from four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, the title's defender, just needed to be empathed to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a contratact is outside his abast.
North Korea states that it will not be unlawfully disarmad "in any way" if no trust signs are appreciated
The North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affeders communicated the United Nations on Sunday that the Sanctions continued to intensify their disagreement in the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not remove unilaterally, in no way, its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization of the North Korea had taken “the measures of good will” during the past year, as to stop nuclear tests and missiles, to discharge the centre of nuclear tests and comprometry to not prolifer nuclear weapons and technologies.
“Instead, we don't observe any answers in consonance of the United States”, said.
“No trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not start disarmament in a unilateral way.”
If Ri renewed the northern Korean coaches on the resistence of Washington at an approach of denuclearization “for fases” for which North Korea would have recompense the measures that he would have taken in the past, its statements seemed significant for the fact that he did not reject the unilateral denuclearisation of full, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Rie refered to the joint statement that Kim Jong One and Donald Trump made in the first cime between a president in functions of the United States and a Leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim was comprometed to work in the “denuclearing of the Korean pension” while Trump promised the security of North Korea.
North Korea has finally tried to set up the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States have reported that Pyongyang has to remove its nuclear weapons before.
Washington also resists the call to relax the severe international sanities imposed in North Korea.
“The United States suggest that the denuclearisation must first be produced and increase the pressure level with sanctions to assume their objective in coercitive ways, more than the “declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions will make us gain is a chemical of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to intensify our defense."
Ri was not mentioned to the plans to celebrate a second circle between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States had raised up the United Nations at the beginnings of the week.
Instead of this, the Ministry destayed three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the denuclearity issue was South Korea in the middle of the United States, the denuclearing of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this staining situation."
However, the top of Ri's discussion was very different from what he held the year past, when he declared the United Nations General Assembly to attend the Territory of the United States with North Korean Missiles was inevitable after the President "Mr. Evil" Trump titles Kim of "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
Injury to the United Nations, Trump, that the year past threatened to “Destruction completely” in North Korea, tried Kim for his corage to take disarmament measures, but she showed that it remains still much to do and sanctions must remain until the North Korea is denuclearistic.
Last weeks, Trump said that there was no term for this, and that "It doesn't matter if two years, three or five months are triggered."
China and Russia support that the United Nations Security Council should preserve Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the state secretary of the United States, Mike Pompeo, declared states to the United Nations Security Council that: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue energy and without exception until we confirm the total and definitive denuclearing."
The Security Council has impulsed sanctions in North Korea in a single way since 2006 in a apostate to cut down the financing of balistic and nuclear missiles programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo was found outside the General Assembly of the United Nations and then reported that I would visit Pyongyang the next month to prepare a second cime.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey was not very well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that they had been advanced, but at the head of a few hours of North Korea, he accused him to make him “tomorrows of a gangster.”
In a meeting with the Moon celebrated this month, the North Korea was emphasized to dismantle a centre of missiles and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures”.
He said that Kim had reported to him that the "consonance measures" that he sought were the security measures that Trump had promised to Singapore, more actions to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students make a curs on reliable habits
Enguany, a new course in Harvard University has allowed his students to sleep more, in a trial to fight culture, every more excited time, to study all night, loved for the cafeïne.
One academic observed that sometimes students in the university number or world are disappointed for the basic aspects of how to care about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of the Sound Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which you think it's the first of its type in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after a warrant on the impact that the privacy of the sound had in learning.
"In the end of the age, a girl touched me and said, "Why do they tell me now, all of this in my last year?"
He said nobody had ever spoken to him about the importance of the sound, which was surprised to me," he reported the The Telegraph journal.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students express the basic concepts on how some good habits of their sound improve the academic and sport rating, more than the general welfare.
Paul Barreira, teacher of Psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Services, stated that the University decided to introduce the course after he realized that some students suffer a serious privacy for the week.
The course, from a long time, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there's a picture of a sleeper, where students need to click on coffee, coffee, bathrooms and books for information about the effects of the cafeine and the light, about how the sport rating affects the sound missing, and about the importance of keeping a rutin to sleep.
In another section, the participants are informed about how the privacy of the sound at long term can increase the risk of painting heart attacks, brain waves, depression and cancer.

“ We know that the conduct of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know it, as one has the right to know the effects that he has for the health to fuel cigarettes," he signed Professor Czeisler.
The culture of honour to remain awake all night still exists, and added that modern technology and pressure growing that students do that the privacy of the sound is a problem every greater time.
Ensure that a sound of good quality should be a “ secret weapons” of students to fight the stress, the singing and anxiety, added, even to avoid winning pest, because the privacy of the sound puts the brain in initiation mode and make students always win.
Raymond So, a 19-year-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after he had attended one of his classs last year in Harvard.
Raymond commented that the curse had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course in all the campus.
The next step, after he expects, is to ask postgree students to implement a similar study program before they enter into competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to take account of the fact that they had a alarm when they were sleeping and when they were awakened, and that they would be known of the perjudicial effects of the "Blue Lum" that emit the electronic panels and LED lights, which can change the harmonia of the ritme and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Golf ends with Gerrard men
The Dolly Menga Golf condemns Steven Gerrard's disarmament team to a shooting for 1-0 to Livingston's house that is supposed to be another attached outside.
The assembly of Ibrox tried to summarize his first home victory from the triumph of February for 4 to 1 to St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt team infected the second loss in Gerrard in 18 parts as trainer to leave his team to the derivative, at 8 points of the Hearts, unable to the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Manga announced the gol seven minutes before the middle part, and never seemed that Rangers, missing inspiration, had been going to be equal to the marker.
While Rangers are now going to the sixth place, Livingston goes to the third position, behind the Hibernian for the difference of gols.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, because the Court of Calum Spence had needed medical attention for a worst in the head caused by an object that appeared to be raised from the grace.
Gerrard made eight changes respecting the alignment that he scattered the Ayrs in the semi-shirts of Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same eleven titler who started a point against the Hearts last week, and he probably felt satisfied by the way his team, well organized, suffered his rivals all the time.
While the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more dangerous when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have marked in two minutes of game, when the first intervention of Menga left Scot Pittman only before Allan McGregor, but the Migcampist was able to go out and disappoint the great occasion.
A missing smoking from Keaghan Jacobs took with Captain Craig Halkett, but his company defense Alan Lithgow just made a little slow on the back side.
Rangers were made with control, but they seemed to have more hope than believe in their game at the third end.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he had to have a penalty in the sign of the 15 minutes, because he and Steven Lawless got gone, but the army Steven Thomson ignored Colombia's reclamations.
The Rangers only led two guys to the first part, but the first port of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly head and the officer before Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's first act at 34 minutes could have been against the carrier, nobody can deny that they would only pay it for their efforts.
And again, Rangers couldn't break with the work game of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who held the calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at the break in changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had an effective impact immediately, since the extern made a past in Morelos, although the emperor Kelly turned to the block.
However, Livingstons continued to understand the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett a long past, one of the other.
Holt's band could have ceased the direction to the final steps, but McGregor stopped refusing Jacobs before Lithgow made a little disappeared from the corner.
The replacement of the Rangers Glenn Middleton still asked a last penalty for a discussion with Jacobs, but Thomson again made the big eyes.
Almanac: the investment of the Geiger accounter
And now a page of Sunday Morning Almanic: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day when the physical of the future, John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born to Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure the radioactivity, an inventor that finally gave place to the device we know as "Computer Geiger".
Geiger's counter, which is a pilar of science from the age, also became a pop culture pile, such as the film of 1950 "Bells of Coronado", protagonized by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some of the physical vaccins appeared to be missed:
Home, "What is this to say?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranian.
When you put these auriculars, you can listen to the effects of the atoms that eject the radio activity to minerals."
Evans: "It's sure he's screaming now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the one who brings his name continues alive.
A new vacation against the cancer can teach the immune system to "vee" bad cells
A new vacation against the cancer can teach the immune system to "vive" and remove the bad cells
Vacation teaches the immune system to recognize is bad cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the explosion of immun cells of a patient and change them to the lab
You can see a common protein in many cancers and then reject them.
A test vacation is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vacation, who taught the immunitary system to recognize the bad cells, saw disappearing the orphanic cancer that suffered over 18 months.
The method implies the explosion of immun cells of a patient, change them to the lab, so that you can "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, afterwards, reinject them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we received suggest that we have a vacation."
The HER2 protein "from the growth of various types of cancer," including the mother, ovari, pulm and color, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus consistent to extract immune cells of patients and "to teach" to these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was branched in a pro-Trump diatriba with a MAGA gorge after its action to the SNL program.
It's not done.
Kanye West was written in the study during the Saturday Night Live programme after a cootic action in which the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that it would be presented to the elections of 2020.
After his third song of the night, named Ghost Town, where he took a gorge of Make America Great Again, he began criticize the democratics and repeat his support to Trump.
"When I speak with white people tell me, how can you like Trump if you're racist?
Well, if I'd worry about the racism, I would have gone from the United States for a long time," he said.
The SNL program started with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star was broken from the witness of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee for the sexual denunciations interposed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't emerged, the counseler Chris Rock raised the recording of West's dealing in social networks.
It wasn't clear if Rock would like to redivide West with the publication.
Although, West has broken the public that wasn't well treated between bathrooms because of the egg that he was driving.
"They were threatened between bastidors.
They told me you didn't go out with that place.
They're gonna get me asset.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," I said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while he said that it was the Superman's layer, so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Will the world go forward?"
Try to love."
His comments caused the writers of the public at least two times and the members of the team of the program seemed arrogant, according to Varety, who had a reporter who explained the public: "The studio was fully muted."
West was taken as a replacement of the last hour of Ariana Grande, the ex-of which Mac Miller was dead for a few days.
West left a good part of the public with the interpretation of the song I Love it, disfreshed by Perrier's emblem.
West obtained the collection of the head of the TTPUSA conservator group, Candace Turner, who killed: "A one of the most valid spirits: GRATICES TO THE DESTACAR IN THE MULTITUD."
But the presentator of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tried that West just was "unless who it is and that is absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to recompense anybody (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I think he's adopting and designing a ideology that perjures my community.
He's free.
And we also," he added.
Before the program, the raper announced to Twitter that he had changed his name and now he was "the first known as Kanye West."
It's not the first artist who changes the name and follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague Raper, Snoop Dogg, before it was called Snoop Lion and the leading loss of the music Prince changed the name for a symbol and later the artist known as Prince.

There are more than 820,000 people affected the country, according to health agents.
Only the second trimester of 2018, 40,000 new cases were stated.
The great majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, in different ways that past.
Traditionally, the HIV was rapidly propagated in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.

Maxine Waters refuses that an employee has filtered data from Senators of the Republic Partie and demonishs "persecutive lies" and "theories of conspiration"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters declared the accusations on the basis of which a member of his personnel had published personal information of three Republic Senators of the United States at the Viquipedia of legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles revealed that the requests impulsed them critical and right extreme websites.
"Listens, lie and more less lying," said Waters in a statement to Twitter.
The published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of the American Lindsey Graham Senators, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on a sauce line and published someone not known to the Capitol during a session of the Senate Committee on sexual denunciations against the candidate of the Supreme Brett Kavanaugh Court.
The information was filtered after three Senators were questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservatory locations, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the Waters' office and that showed the information of a member of the Waters personnel, declared the Capitol.
"This without funding is completely false and a clean lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my personal, identity, personal data and security of which have been seen compromeses because of these false and fraudulent denunciations, was not responsible for any way of this information filtering.
This without funding is completely false and pure invention."
Waters' declaration generated critical in a quick line, including the pressure of the White House, Ari Fleicher.
"This negative is full of indication," wrote Fleicher.
"This does think that there is no temperation to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he doesn't have to be struck.
You don't have to show disappointment.
You don't have to question the reasons of the accuser.
He has to keep calm and serenor."
Fleecher seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the critical of Judge Kavanaugh Democratics, whose critics were accused to seem too disappointed during the seat session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presented to distract Waters in the middle legislation elections, also expressed his opinion to Twitter.
"Importing if it's true," he taught.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned the authorities and the relevant security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are discovered, he continued, and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they have done in terms and they have persuaded everyone and everyone of my personal members."
Johnny English Strikes Critical Regain: Rowan Atkinson Limited Space Parade
It is traditional to search for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this repository of the franquez of the Johnny English comédia parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English, and again appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, not an exception.
This humoristic self-sharing is a new opportunity for exporting the country?
In any case, the incompetent of the eye outside and the face of Johnny English could renew his license in second time to touch it. His name indicates more than any other thing that is a comic creation designed for the territory of speaking territory, not English with tradition to go to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent that, although his rare presences of liquid glass, has a little Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy that brings one note on the subject of fire Carros to the inaugural Olympics games in London 2012.
Originally, it was based on the international traveller and mysterious Atkinsons who represented the now forgotten announcements of Barclaycard TV, where they were going to look closely.
There's one or two good moments in this last Jee.
I liked Johnny English that was accompanied to a helicopter clothed with a medieval armor, and the shelf of the helicopter repaired him in the box.
You see what Atkinson has for physical comédia, but the humor seems to be so flushed and weirdly overflowed, especially because the cinematographical marks "series" like 007 and Mission cannot be included now as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be destined to children more than not to adults, and for me the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not so amazing or infocated as the mute guests of Mr. Bean who represents Atkinson.
The repeatly thick now is that the Great Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has been infiltred into the British supersecret web spees network and has revealed the identities of all the British agents on the ground, which cause the constraint of the service agent, a lately small paper for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a Prime Minister that is a pretensive and asseted figure, which has already affected a total collapse of missing political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her with this custom personage of Teresa-May, but the guidance is not upstairs.
His intelligence advisers tell him that, as each active spice is in danger, it will be necessary to recover some jubilates.
And this includes the crazy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but learning extra-official classs about how to be covered, with some good guests, as now when English offers a spioning academy that seems a rock school.
English has returned quickly to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his squad sufferer Bough, a paper that returns to represent Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, connected to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little unprofit.
So, Batman and Robin of when things are very loud in the secret service of his Majesty, they enter in action again and find Olga Kurylenko the "fatal woman" ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the first Ministry takes dangerously under the technology carismatic billioner, which says that you can resolve the information problems of Great Britain: the left Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odds of ridicules: broken of rooms, burning a French restaurant of fast food, seeming the caos against the ground of Volta luxury and English causes a great confusion trying to use a virtual reality box to familiarize himself with the house of Volta.
All the paradise have already been exhausted from this last sequence, but with all simplifiedness and soil that presents, all placed looks like a child program.
That's enough normal.
Like the other films of Johnny English, it wasn't helped to think if the cinematographic industry gave Rowan Atkinson a paper that was justified to his talent.
The Laboratory Partie refuses to think about a plan that the British have a week of four days and cover it five
The Laboratory Party of Jeremy Corbyn will be considered a radically plan according to which the British will work for four weeks and take it five.
The party must like the heads of the company to pass through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers give them a more party day.
The employees will enjoy a week-of-day head of three days, but they find the same sound.
According to the sources, the idea would take place with the economic agenda of the games and the plans to incline the country for the workers.
The change in a week of four days of labour is counted with support of the Sindica Conference Trades Union Congress as a method that workers can benefit from the economic change.
A experimental source of the Laboratory Partie stated to the Sunday Times: "The Sunday Times is predicted to preach a review of the policy before the end of the year.
It's not evening at the day, but a week of four days is an aspiration that is in the perspective of the Partie to equilib the economy for the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Laboratory Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Partie promised a work week for four days during the campaign of the general elections of 2017.
However, the Laboratory Partie does not support this aspiration currently commonly.
According to a portfolio of the Working Partie: "A four days' working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Minister in the shadow of John McDonnell used the conference of the party of the past week to detail his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell showed his determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and "specific" in public services.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also implied that the actors of water companies could not recover all the investment, because the laborist government could apply "deductions" for the crimes I understand.
It has also confirmed plans to collect workers to companies and to create include property backgrounds to free a 10% of the activities of the private sector to employees, which expect yearly divided by a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains "60 minutes" if the Kavanaugh research of the FBI could change them.
The investigation of the FBI of accusations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh has repeated the final vote of its nomination for the Supreme Court at least a week, and has made the question about whether the detections of the Agency could influence some republic senator to remove its support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the Corporate of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the republic senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could remove the light of something that he did to change their opinion.
Kennedy was shown more open than his south Carolina colleague.
"That's serious," said Kennedy.
"In the session I said I was talking to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened, and they made public accusations, and I asked him if I did it.
It was shown close, determined and safe."
But Graham's vote seems recorded in fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a explosive accusation," she said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it around," added Graham refering to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And nobody of the people who named can't check it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see you change anything again."
What's the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will welcome this Sabbath of the Global City Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressing stars program, which brings a similar mission to impressing: devoting poverty in the world.
In the seventh enguay editing, the Global City Festival will see thousands of people's designs to meet in the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not just to please acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to wake up the consciousness of the global objective of the event to come out with the extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global City Festival, which started in 2012, is a extension of Global Poverty Project, a international defence group that expects to end with poverty through the increase of the number of people who help to fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (which somebody wants to pay a VIP entry), the assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", as now to make volunteers, send an email to a world-wide leader, make a telephone call or any other activities to wake up the conscience about the purpose of achievement of poverty.
What success has Global Citizen now achieved for 12 years to come to their goal?
The idea of preventing people with a free concert is a good way to persecute it to require a call to the action or just a case more than we call "clicticism" (gent that thinks that the difference marks for signing a request on line or sending a tute?
From 2011, Global Citizen states that it has been registered more than 19 million "actions" of his sympathians, which have helped to achieve several objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce equipped commitments and policies more than 37,000 million USD, which have affected the life of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group expressed 390 commitments and announces from its actions, from which 10,000 million USD has already been disrupted or reached at least.
The group likes that the protected backgrounds have now exercised a direct impact at about 649 million people in the world.
Some of the main commitments include the foundation The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and realizers with their own in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "aid children to grow as possible as possible" and promised to send to Ruanda 35 million USD to help the malnutrition to the country after reaching more than 4.700 people of Global Citizens.
"Thanks the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global citozens, such as you, can become the social injustice of denutrition in a few pages of the history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the multitude during a concert directly to London on April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5000 actions requested the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will come to 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the P+F of their web site that asked, "What do you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered, "I'll be a long and hard path, sometimes we'll get and miss.
But as the great movements of defense of civil rights and against the previous apartment, we will triumph, because we are together stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will act at the event of indigene in New York, which will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Marine as "blocking" to obstacle Russian energy exports (Inner Secretary)
Washington can, "if it is necessary" to reach the Marine to prevent Russian energy to punish the markets, including the Middle East, has discovered the Secretary-General of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke declared that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it works with a legal government invitation, is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I think the motive for which they are in the Middle East is its will to negotiate with the energy, as they have already done in East Europe, the South Europe,," said it suspected.
According to the office, there are ways and media to face this question.
"The United States have the capacity, together with the sea, to ensure that maritime lives are open and, if necessary, for the blocking, to prevent their energy to enter the market," declared.
Zinke was addressed to assistants in the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, an unanimous group of winning that is automatically defined as the "vone of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and said that it actually is equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, to apply and replace combustible," said I, while indicated that Russia has only a resource, because its economy is deprived from fossil combustible.
The statements arrive while Trump administration has been in a mission to impulse the export of its natural gas liquor to Europe, in Russia's replacement, the most economic option for European consumers.
With this end, the officers of Trump, including the own President of the United States, Donald Trump, tried to persecute Germany because of the project of North Stream 2 "indequat" which, according to Trump, converted Berlin to Moscow's "captiu".
Moscow repeatedly insisted that the project of the North Stream Gas 2 which has been about 11,000 million USD and that will duplicate the capacity of the existing gasoduct to 11 million cubic meters is a pure economic project.
Kremlin arguments that the challenge of Washington to the project is just to economic reasons and is a example of delicious competence.
I think we share the opinion that the energy cannot be a tool to press and that consumers have to choose the providers, declared the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the Secretary of Energy Department of the United States Rick Perry, celebrated in Moscow on September.
The posture of the United States has caused a negative response from Germany, which has resigned its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries) has approved the United States to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interfers in our energy administration," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries), after a recent meeting between the German cancer of Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren confirmed the Sabbath that his candidate for the presidency after the elections of half legislative elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidate.
"The time the women go to Washington and fix the fracture of the government, that women buy up high loads," said The Hill.

Sarah Palin quoted the effect of TEPT Track Palin at the view of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) was a year in Iraq after she was held on September 11, 2007
Monday, they arrested him and carried him in a case of a household violence
"Because what is happening to my own son since he returned, I can understand other families that affect TEPT ramps and some of the emotional harms with what our soldiers return, "declared the public in a meditation of Donald Trump to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the last "the elephant in the room" and said the next one of his son and other war veterans: "They turn a little different, they're indulgent, they're going to ask if there's respect for their soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."

18 states and DC supports a new asylum policy
Division states and the District of Colombia supports legal disafiance to a new United States policy that refuses the asylum to victims who flee from bands or home violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a healthy friend to Washington to collect a asylum requesting, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request of the case Grace vs Sessions that the United States for Civil Liberties presented the month of August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his couple "and the children of the member of the violent band" were attached to it, but the north-American officials denied their asylum's request on 20 July.
They arrested her in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum requests are generated in the United States, such as countries that are compared to general problems of bands and home violence.
The new United States asylum policy rejected a decision from 2014 of the Commission of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape from home violence to ask for asylum.
The general officer of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, declared Fridays that the new policy "ignore decades of State, Federal and International legislation."
Federal laws require that asylum requests approval according to the facts and specific circumstances of the request, and this prohibition infringes this principle, according to the health friend.
The lawyers also suggested the report that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants to prevent the economy of the United States, because it is most likely to become enterprises and "promotion of necessary workplaces".
In June, the general officer Jeff Sessions ordered the courts of immigration to not allow any more victims to escape from household violence and bands.
"The asil is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or personality to a social group or a specific political opinion," said the Sessions to his announcement on 11 June of this policy.
The asylum has never seen all the problems, nor only the worst ones, in which people face each day around the world.

"The environment is very much," said Risa Kusuma's mother, 35 years old when she calmed his son with February in a evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Any minute, a ambulance goes bodies.
There's no potable water."
The residents have seen back to their ruined houses to take inundate pertinences and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of worsts, and hospitals, worse for magnitude 7,5, are sad.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, who have broken the shop, are outside Palu military hospital, because the patients are treated out because of the strong saxy that are repeated.
The lacrimes rejected his eyes while he explained how the violent earthquake cut out the room of the fifth plant of the hotel where he was found with his wife and his daughter.
"No time was to save us.
I was thrown into the roines of the wall, I think," explained Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family had been attending a marriage to the people.
"I'll hear my wife ask help weeping and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're good."
The United States Ambassador accuses China attentively with "propaganda announces".
One week after a Chinese official publication published an announcement of four pages in a North-American journal promoting mutual trade benefits between the United States and China, the US embassor in China accused Beijing to use the north-American pressure to decrease propaganda.
President Donald Trump has been addressed a weekend past to China Daily's payment supply to The Des Moines Register, the most coming journal of Iowa, after accusing China to immiss the elections of the United States Congress of 6 November, China's accusation.
Trump's accusation according to which Beijing tried to immiss in the United States elections marked what the North-American officials told Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert announces to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trained in a commercial war that is intensified and has seen supporting the aranzels in mutual imports.
The vengetic aranzels of China at the beginning of the trade war had the objective of punishing States exporters, such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republic Party, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Brandstad, the US emissor in China and Iowa ruler for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, says that Beijing had persuaded the workers, branches and companys of the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's redowaling the advice with the publication of propaganda announces to our free pressure."
"In developing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the loved north-American tradition of the freedom of expression and free pressure in setting a payment announcement to The Des Moines Register," wrote Brandstad.
"In change, to whom there's a way down here in Beijing, you'll find a little discreptable voice and you don't see any real reflection of the shooting opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the economic trajectories of China, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," wrote.
He added that "the one of the most detailed days of China was the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't tell the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women voters before the elections of half legislation with Kavanaugh's destruction, they warn the analysts
As many of the main Republicans support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which is against several requests for sexual attack, analists have warned that they will see a negative answer, especially among women, the next legal elections.
Emotions that involve this case are extremely high and most of the republics have already shown officially that they want to make a step in a vote.
These things can't be disappeared," explained Grant Reeher, a teacher of political sciences of Maxwell School of the Syracuse University, in The Hill for a article published on the Sabbath.
Reeher said that the pressures of the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) because it's duplicated to conclude a investigation of the FBI would be enough to calm the voted votes.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, nor tomorrow nor to November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the main assistant and carried the National Progressist Group of MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington's journal, D.C.
Wednesday at the morning, the protestants called "November is comeing!" (November arrived) while they were shown in the seminar's vessel, while the republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the name of Kavanaugh unless the witness of the dra. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The entusiasm and motivation of demokrates will be outside the graphics," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analytical in the news place.
"The people say they've already been high, it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years, which often do not vote while the president does not like them."
Even before the public witness of Ford, where he detailed his requests for sexual attacks to the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analysists suggested that it could be a negative answer if the republicans pressed with confirmation.
"This has become an emblem for the GOP," said Michael Steele, representative of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the past week, under NBC News.
"It's not only the vote of the joint or the final vote, nor of if Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the accusers. It's also to see how the republicans have managed this subject and how they have handled it to her," advised Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group who helps to choose demokrates in the news channel.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford island and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with the balance that is lying to the last.
A new YouTube request shows that 41% of the inquisitives believe in unbelievable or probablely in Ford's witness, while 35% says to believe in unbelievable or possibly Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, a 38 per cent said that I believed that Kavanaugh was probably lying or unbelieving during his witness, while 30 per cent stated the same Ford.
After Flake pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the requests interposed for Ford and, at least, another denunciant, Deborah Ramirez, section The Guardian.
Ford tested before the Judicial Committee of the Senate under the past week that Kavanaugh had raised him under the alcohol effects when he had 17 years.
Ramirez declared that the candidate to the Supreme Court taught him the Gentils in a party when they studied Yale at the decade of the 80th.
The World Wide Web Inventor plans to create a new Internet to competite with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web invester is built a new company that wants to competite with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology reading, Inrupt, is a company based on the open code platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where they store their data and what people can access to certain information.
In a exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee broke that the hidden intention of Inrupt was "domine the world."
"We have to do this now," said the emergency company.
"It's a story moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal data store" or a POD.
You can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They are all available in a browser now.
What is exclusive of the personal data store is that the user is who decides who can access some information.
The company calls it "personal extent through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the delegated advice of the company, John Bruce, is that the entire resources, processes and aptitudes that Solid platform is available for everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safe platform which IBM is built, some developers in the models contracted to work in the project and a voluntary coder community.
Since this week, the world's technology developers can create their own applications uncentralised by using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee said nobody of his team talks with "Facebook and Google" if you need to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely cleaned during the night.
"We don't ask them permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and a ecosystem to help protect integrity and quality of the new web integrated in the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium to the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
Last months, Berners-Lee has been a sound influenced on the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during Inrupt's breakdown, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incrediblely optimist about this new was from the web," added Berners-Lee.

The card of San José contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be seen directly all night in the United Kingdom in Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared for the front, the United Kingdom spectacles stayed at the time the programming changed Peppa Pig.
Some were shown disgusted because they had passed up the night until the morning to see the war.
A Twitter follower described the changes for animated designs as a "a kind of smooth acid".
"The government's rule says that this content is not appropriate, so they have changed the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Marqueting and Communication of Bellator, when they asked him about the retransmission.
"Peace the bottle, yeah."
The President of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said that they would work in the programme to include the United Kingdom's spectators in a future.
"I think when I think of the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are the six of the morning of a Sunday and we can't resolve it until the Sunday to our hour, on the morning.
But we're working there.
Trust me, when I changed the channel, there were many messages that came and came, and not all were happy.
We tried to resolve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't so, it was a governmental problem.
I promise he won't happen again.
We're trying to show it back to the followers, but it's over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
The Olympic Saltator Tom Daley said that he had grown down the rest of people because of his sexuality, but that he gave him the motivation to triumph.
The sportist of 24 years stated that he was not described until he went to the second school that they were not all like him.
In the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of the gas to give "sperance" to other people.
He also said that he was a father who had the importance to win the Olympics Games.
The regular presentator of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of low-term disease.
Daley, who appeared as a neighborhood in the first Laverne program, said that he felt "minder than" the others because "I was not socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of unfairness and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove that it was " something," he said, so that he didn't deceive anybody when he came to discover his sexuality.
The two-time guaranteer of the olympical bronze media has become a high-profile promotor of the LGBT movement and has used its images the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries that describe the homosexuality.

In the past year, Daley married with the guest of a Oscar, 20 more bigger than he, but he says that the difference of the age has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go so when you're young (he was participating in his first Olympics games when I was 14, and his father died from cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced high and low.
The couple was parent in June of a kid who put the name of Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me the year past, everything I needed was to win an olympic gold," he said.
"There's more important than the olympical gold meals.
My olympical gold medal is Robbie."
His son is like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, in 40 years ago because of a brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father didn't accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if they had the income for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell you, you won't be to buy the first row," said.
"Besides he took his hand, he left to respira and wasn't even then, who was already dead, that I finally accepted that it was not invincible," said.
The next year, Daley concurred to the Olympics games of 2012 and won the bronze.
"I knew that that it was what I had dreamed all my life: to go before a multitude to home in a Olympics games, there was no better feeling," said he.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small Proud), who had heard during the preparation for the Olympics Games, and he still put the gallin floor.

An emperor Mickelson was presented to the Ryder Cup Saturday
The North American Phil Mickelson will play a weekend record at playing his 47th part of Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unfortunate field.
Mickelson, who will participate in the welcome event to buy a record for 12 times, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "fourballs".
Instead of being in the center of the action, as usually for the United States, the guaranteer of five main tours shares his time between makers of animator and work in his game in the camp, with the hope of justifying what is wrong to him.
He never made the most direct drivers, nor even at the moment of his carrying, but the player of 48 years is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough is attached to punish the despairs.
And if your own trajectory is not enough decorative, Mickelson, on the new party of the Sunday, the price campion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who is joined to the rooky Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parts of this week.
If the North Americans, four points down by starting the 12 individual parties, they start strong, Mickelson's party could be absolutely critical.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unless he could tell him much more.
"It's perfectly understanding his role for that day, he made me a palm on the sketch and turned me with the arm while he said I'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a room of the famous room, and he's brought very much to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two parts.
I imagined it more, but it's like I trained, and it's how we believe we had to go forward.
He wants to be there, like any other."
Wednesday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of games of Ryder Cup played.
It may mean the end of a carrier to Ryder Cup that doesn't equal its individual record.
Mickelson has received 18 victories, 20 dead and seven empathies, although Furyk said that his presence has been intangible to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, bromatic, it's like to worry about people and it's a great company for the team," he explained.
"I think the youngest players are also happy to stay with him this week, what was fun to see.
Take a lot more on your game."
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance can be exceeded immediately
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows by experience that the individual duties of the last day of Ryder Cup may be easy to become a hard day.
The Danish started 1997 in Valderrama, when the headquartered team for Seven Ballesteros had five points on the American team, but at the end they got the victory for the minimum, 14,5-13,5.
"And you continue to remember that we had a great benefit in Valderrama; we had a great benefit to Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we win, but at least," said Bjorn, on the picture, after seeing the gain of the team of 2018 for 5-3 so many Sundays as yesterday, which left the booker in 10-6 to Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the members of the team who haven't yet been done.
We have to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
He needs to go out and do it all right.
This wasn't over until the points could be able to the bookmark.
We have a goal, trying to win the trife, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said, I'm focused on the 12 players we have at the team, but I'm also present who are our rivals: the best players of the world."
Like the reward of his players in a required golf field, Bjorn added: "I'll never precipite me with this.
Tomorrow it'll be different.
Tomorrow the individual reward will mark the difference and change it all.
It's amazing to be there with a friend when it's okay, but the individual duties are testing your maximum capacity to play the golf.
This is the message you have to transmit to the player, remove the best from you tomorrow.
In this time, let your partner and he's gonna go out and take the best of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the River Captain, Jim Furyk, hoped that his player would make better individually than at the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, which took three points of four.
Furyk knows all the two parts of the monetary on the remunerations of the last day, because he formed part of the guaranteer team in Brooklyn before the loss of the "Mednah Miracle" who won Europe.
"I recall exactly all the words," said the question about how Ben Crenshaw motivated the captain of 1999, his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow, we have 12 important parts, but we want to start with a little bit, as she saw in Brooklyn and Mednah.
When there is a team that is inspired, it is generated a lot of pressure in these central parts.
We've prepared the alignment in the function of circumstances and the best way to try to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the repeat to start the remuneration against Rory McIlroy in the main dust, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think he covers all the opportunities," said Bjorn about his choice for individual faces.
The New War ship in Germany, raised again
The new fragate of the German Army should have finished 2014 to replace the old war ships of the Freda War, but he will not do it, at least, until the year that you're running defective systems and a increase of cost, seconds of local communications.
The end of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has been placed to the first half of 2019, according to the Day time journal, which quotes a military port.
The ship should be united in Armada in 2014, but the following problems in the construction have marked the terms of this ambitional project.
The four ships of Baden-Württemberg that Armada carried in 2007 are replaced by the old Bremen class.
It is thinking that it will include a canon power, a conjunction of anti-auriers and anti-bucks, as well as technologies against furtive actions, such as a reduced radio, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other detailed characteristics include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new fragates to two years without pass through national ports.
However, these continuous summers implied that the forward ships, which were prevented that they could project in Germany as a powerful force in the foreigner, will already be obsolete when they enter in functioning, seconds Die Time.
The unfortunate fragate F125 was already new in the past year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned to the Blohm & Yous of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Armady returned a ship to the builder once free.
They know little detail of the motives that have returned, but the German media have heard various "matrix and technical defects" of the ship that did it unservable if it was used in battle missions.
Technical problems are important, because about 120 mariners, half of the tripulation needed for the old Bremen class fragments, work in Baden-Württemberg class ships.
Furthermore, it was also known that the weight of the ship is excessive, because it reduces the reward and limits the capacity of the Army to add better future.
It is thinking that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7000 tons, will suffer the double ships of class like used by Germany during the Second World War.
On the basis of defective materials, the cost of the project, including the training training, also began to suggest a problem.
It is thinking that it has arrived to 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars) from an initial budget of 2,200 million euros.
The problems of the new fragates have become a special subject of important, if they are considered the recent warnings that indicate that it is disabilizing the maritime military power of Germany.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, captain of the German Defence Committee, recognized that the Armady's remaining without ships that can be used.
The office stated that the situation has been initiated with time because it was left to use the old ships, but it wasn't delivered any of them again as reaching.
He was sorry that no part of the Baden-Württemberg class could be joined to Armada.
The National Fund springs the secret life of the ratings
A new research realized in a finch of the high-terms of Scotland are trying to find how the ratpanates use the landscape to eat.
It hopes that discoverys can bring new data on the behavior of these only volunteers and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists of the National Scotland Foundation will continue soprano and common ratifications, more north-early and water rapens in the Botanic Jardi of Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are located in key locations of the property to follow the activities of the ratings during the station.
Volunteers and personals of the United Kingdom Health Service will also make mobile samples with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of records by experts will determine the sound frequency of ratings and what every type does.
With this information, a report and a map of the hazard will be created to create a detailed image on the pattern of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural maintenance assistant of the National Scocia Foundation, expects to show the results which areas of the holiday are more important for the ratings and how it uses them every kind.
This information will help us to determine the benefits of staff management works, such as the creation of prats, and how to improve the maintenance of the woods for rapens and other associated species.
The population of rapts in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has been considerablely reduced in the last century.
Building tasks and restauration of buildings threaten the rapens, because they affect the nine and can cause the loss of fault.
Wind turbines and airlines also suffer a risk, like the math and chemical treatment used in construction materials, as well as household gats attacks.
Actually, rapens are not blind.
Yet, because of their nightmarks of box, the ears are more useful than the eyes when they have to get a prison.
Using a sophistic location technique for eco to locate insects and obstacles that are involved in their air.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares in all the country, are very serious.
He has ten experts with the appropriate training, which realize sonds, nine inspections, and sometimes, usually rescue.
Even though, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to rapens in the Threave State finch, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth of the ten species of ratification of Scotland.
The Finch Manager, David Thompson, says that it's the ideal territory for the species.
" Here, in Threave, we have a great area for rapens," says.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all a good stage.
But we still don't know many aspects of rapens, so that the work we do here and other properties will help us to understand better what they need to grow."
Take note the importance of check if there are rapens before doing holding jobs in properties, because it may be that the possible destruction would be involuntary of a only level of maternity killed more than 400 women and young women, which could be the loss of all a local population.
The rapens are protected and is illegal to kill them, to attack them, to hurt them, and to destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scope Conservation Fund, encouraged people to make a step in order to help.
He said, "We still have to learn much of the rapens and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data about their population."
Ronaldo refuses violation accusations while your lawyers prepare a request against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo showed that violation accusations against him are "false news" and said that people "who would be famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will ask the German newspaper Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
Portuguese and Juvento was accused to violate a US woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room of a Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
Presumedly, he paid 375,000 dollars in his moment because the accident is not public, according to the public information of the party for Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live in which he was addressed to his 142 million followers of hours after the accusations were made public, Ronaldo, of 33, said that they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five times winer of the gold pilot in the camera.
"I want to be famous thanks for my name.
It's normal.
They want to apply my name to be famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and it's all in order," he added the player, a song.
Ronaldo's lawyers have already prepared the request against Der Spiegel for accusations, which have been qualified as "inadmissible information of suspects about private life", in accordance with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will look for a compensation for "moral damage for a corresponding value to the graveness of infraction, which probably is one of the most flagrants of personal rights in the past years."

Breakfast: The United Kingdom will "away be pened" to lose automatic manufacturers
The United Kingdom will always be punished, if you lose the world's leader's state in the manufacture after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "behaviour" that the foundation of Toyota in the United Kingdom had confirmed the BBC that if the United Kingdom had left the European Union without access to any agreement, it would immediately stop the production in Burnaston's fabric, near Derby.
"We need a agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer indicated that the impact of the retards in the borders in the case of a without agreement could cause losses of work sites.
The Burnaston plant, which produced the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced in the past year 150,000 cars, from which a 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My viewpoint is that if the United Kingdom goes out of the EU without agreement on the end of March, the production will be stopped in our fabric," said Marvin Cooke, Director of Toyota to Burnatton.
Exiting from the EU without agreement on how trade will work with the rest of EU countries has raised the worsts of other builders of the United Kingdom, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that Mini's plant will be closed in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production string in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is implemented in a "right-time-based basis", with fishs that are achieved every 37 minutes of the United Kingdom providers and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom goes out of the European Union without achievement on 29 March, it is possible that there may be disturbations at the border, that the sector considers that it could generate travel and fish escapes.
It would be impossible to Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day in Derbyshire's plant, according to the company, and it would have to stop the production as consequences.
Clark states that the Chequers of Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "required to prevent these border controls."
"We have to come to a agreement. We want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to please the current success, but also to apply this opportunity," said the Today BBC Radio 4.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to continue with a conjunction of production strings."
Toyota could not confirm how long the production was stopped, but in long term, he warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of workplaces.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the United Nations coordinator in the planet, has stated that the members begin to be very worried about the situation: "For experience, when these workshops are lost, they will never return."
A government portfolio said, "We have designed a precious and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."

However, it was announced for the deputy a meeting with Trump, which was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump stated that "preference not" was committed to Rosenstein, but the meeting was made to prevent an encouraging with the audience of the Secretary Court of Justice in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of evil sexual conduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Wednesday, Trump ordered an investigation of a week in the FBI on accusations against Kavanaugh, so he made more vote to all the Senate.
The Trump Press secretariat, Sarah Sanders, appeared to Fox News Sunday.
Asking about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following, "He hasn't yet been fixed any date, it might be this week, although it may be a week more for all the subjects with the high court.
But we'll see it, I'll always like to keep information about the press."
Some journalists may refuse this statement: Sanders has not made any information session of the White House since 10 September.
The representative Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that the missing of information sessions was not because I didn't like the fanfarony of the television journalists, although he said, "I'm not denied that they are fanfarons."
Afterward, he insisted that the direct contact between Trump and the pressure would increase.
"The president has more questions and answers than no previous president," said, before adding the following without citing it, "We have consulted these data."
Sanders stated that information sessions will continue to be located, but "if the pressure has the possibility to ask the President of the United States directly, it is very much better to talk to me.
We're trying to do it often, you have seen us much in the last weeks and replace the information sessions when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump replies to questions when the White House goes out or participates in open sessions or pressing roads with dignitaris in official visits.
individual press routes are a little frequency.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, it was strange before the meeting journalists.

But the Government of the United Kingdom has also started preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know they're convulsive for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all members of the personnel, independently of their nationality.
EU companies, and more elsewhere, provide a valuable experience and debts that enhance and improve the work of the health service, at the same time they benefit patients and communities that we train.
Of course, Scotland is your house and we want you to stay here."

Foreign purchasers should pay a higher tax payment to buy a property to the United Kingdom
Foreign purchasers should pay a higher payment to buy a property to the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help people without leaving the new plans of the Conservatory Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to reach young votings.
The increase in the timber board will be recorded in those people who don't pay imposes to the United Kingdom.
Hessenda expects to get up to 120 million years of freedoms to help people without dance.
It is hoped that foreign buyers are a higher taste to buy a property in the United Kingdom and these money will be used to help people without dance, a measure that Theresa May will be announced today.
This action seems like a trying to neutralize the success of the movement of Jeremy Corbyn to reach young votings with promises to provide more accommodable homes that affect the highest rates.
The increase in the imposition of timber will be recorded in those people and enterprises who don't pay payments to the United Kingdom; these money will be destined to the government's action to fight the circles of people without loan.
The overload, which will be added to the current timber, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and immobilial speculations, could be from 3%.
Hessenda expects to get up to 120 million years of freedoms.
It loves that 13% of the new construction properties of London are residents that are not British, that increases the prices and difficulties that new buyers can not be opened in the area of properties.
Many welcome areas in the country, especially to capital, have been converted to "the fantasma cities" arranged by the great quantity of strangers who passed the majority of the time outside the country.
The new measure up on weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the thick board to help young people get their first place.
He accused the great constructions to maintain the prices of the properties that purchased the ground quickly and didn't use it, and he encouraged May to interrupt the quotes on the assets to correct the "immobilier disaster" of the British.
Corbyn announced a series of immobiliar reforms proposed, such as controls on the air and the end of the denotations "no sin."
He also wants to give more authority to meetings to build new places.
May said: "The last year I said I would offer my command to restore the British dream: life must be improved for each new generation.
And that means to correct our immobiliar market broken.
The British will always be opened to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can not be correct that it is easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses with their own in the foreigner, to buy lives in comparison with British inhabitants that work hard.
For too many people, dreams to have a dream in property is too far, and the insensibility of people without dance is still more real."
Jack Ross: "My most ambition is to train the Scotland."
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said that his "maximum ambition" is to be the teacher of Scotland at some time.
Scope, 42 years old, accepted the repeat to revive the North-East club, which now takes the third position at League One, at three points of the leader.
He came to the Stadium of Light this week after returning St. Mirren to Scottish Premiership the past time.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me as support and that's all," said Ross to the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew to see a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was small and always is a thing that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I have successful training clubs, but."
The predecessors of Ross in the Sunderland leadership include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The Aloa Athletic Extreme says that it doesn't feel the pressure of being the next in a list of names dedicated in a so large team, after he rejected previously the offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now, my criteria to measure my success will be if I can make this team back to the First League.
With the structure and the installations of the club, it is clear that its place is the First League, he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I had success here if I can make it back to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer, after a period as a second trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months in the technical body of Hearts.
He helped Alloa to prevent the descense to the third category and transformed the St Mirren to fight for the salvation to Campions of Championship the next time.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a decisive moment," he remembered to accept the load to the Alloa.
"I always thought to train it was what was given to me better, more than to play.
It sounds weird because I did it well, I went out rarely, and I felt enough algid moments.
But the game may be very hard.
There are many things you have to be over every week.
It still happens in aspects like stress and pressure of work, but I feel good as trainer.
I always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, it's the time I've heard that I'm growing."

The reduction of 1,8% of the consumption in the restaurants of June has injured in July.
The bars and boards, leading for drink consumption, have received the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered the sun, although it was not so dramatic as well as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out and drink.
In the bars and the boards we consulted, the drinks have increased 6,6% during the month, while the food solds have reduced a 3%."
Paul Newman, of the RSM analysis and hotel analysis, stated the following: "The results continue the tendency we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sport events continue to feel the main factors related to the sales of the external market.
It's not surprised that restaurants continue to have problems, but a reduction of the sales of a 4,8% interanual would be especially perjudicial, more than the continued pressure for costs.
This is so long and calorous, he couldn't have arrived in a worse moment for trades they serve food and the time will say if the most moderate temperatures we had in the August will provide this respiration so necessary."
The total increase in bars and restaurants, including the recently opened, has been 2,7% of July, as indicating the alert in the market presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and tables of the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data of 47 operating groups, with a combinated loss of over 9 million freedoms and is the reference point of the sector.

An announcement of tickets comparing mothers with birds divides the opinion on the Internet
A training company divided the opinion on the Internet with an announcement that compares the lactant mothers with eggs that are moving.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "primally silent ticket that can be brought from the world", the technology company for the consumer Elvie has made an inspired announcement in a musical video of broma to show the freedom that gives the new ticket to the mothers.
Four real mothers ball on a branch full of farmers and birds in the ritme of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I'm moving myself, but you're not gonna see any coat" and "For if you don't have told you, they're not braguers, but my legs."
"Bombeja, bombea, food of the kids, bombea, bombea, moving the girls."
However, the announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused a controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 comments and hundreds of comments, the video has received a box of reactions from whom he has seen it, of which many say that they show the "horrors" of the lack industry.
"A lot of bad decisions to use vaccines to announce the product.
Like us, we have to stay embarrassed and stopped to produce lots, with the difference that are separated from his grandfathers a few days after getting up," a person wrote.
Elvie's ticket is deceived in a lactant supporter (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented the following: "Coming traumatic for mother and child.
But why don't you use them to announce a ticket for mothers who will keep their children?"
Another user added, "It's an announcement outside."
Others defend the preaching; a woman admitted that the song was "writing."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I had to give Mom.
I just felt like a vacuum.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it must be taken as it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a funny announcement to mothers who bombing with tickets (normally on their job or lavabo and feel like they were vacuum.
It's not an announcement to plot or judge the lacking industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have all packed with the ticket disregarded to the supporters.
The concept that is loved to reach the campaign is based on the perception that says many women who feel like weapon when they use the ticket .
However, Elvie ticket is completely silent, there is no cable or tub and discreet in a lacking sustainer, which gives more freedom to women to move, subject the kids, and even, out while it's bombing.
Ana Balarin, a soviet and developer of Mother's first child, stated: "The traveled Elvie is a so revolutionary product that provides a relief and provocatory campaign.
In training the parallelisme between women and birds, we wanted to show the public how to use a ticket and the repeat that is supposed to do it, at the time we showed, intertender and detactic, the incredible sense of freedom that offers the new ticket.
It's not the first time Elvie's gone in the news.
During the week of London’s mode, a mother of two children appeared to the passacel for the designer Marta Jakubowski when he used the product.
hundreds of emigrants kids, traveled silently to a tender campaign to the border of Texas
The number of resident emigrants children has increased even though the monthly entry throughout the border has been practically maintained, in particular because the retorical and politicals introduced by Trump administration have difficulty for children's attack.
Traditionally, most padrins were immigrants without papers, who had to risk their possibility to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased June, when the federal authorities have announced that the potential parent and the rest of advantages that live in their places should send digital businesses, which are shared with immigration authorities.
The past week, Matthew Albence, a high range officer of the migration and control of twice, tested before the Congress that the Agency had arrested twelve people who had requested to accept minors.
The Agency confirmed later than 70% of the prisoners had no previous criminals.
"Property of 80 percent of people who have received or lived in the front of a person who has taken are in the country of illegal form, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
To process the kids faster, the officers have introduced new standards that require some of them to be presented to the judge in a month after they were retained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the refuge workers.
Many of them will appear for video conference, instead of presence, to defend their cases to get the legal state before a court of immigration.
All those who are not considered appetite for help will be deported immediately.
How much more time children are going to pass in custody, most likely they will be painful of anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or trying to escape, according to the workers and reports that he has given to meet the system in the last months.
The lawyers say that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations such as Tornillo, where it is most likely that, because of its size, the signs that indicate that a child is patent.
They added that the children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally and to say to friends can cause a trauma that already hurts many.
Syria encourages the United States, France and Turkey's "occupied forces" to remove immediately
In directing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, asked the Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been eight years of hard.
Muallem, who also acts as a vice-minister, has stated that strange forces were in Syrian in an illegal way, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the assumption will be done in consequence."
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "the terror fight practiceally ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people since 2011 and the conflict caused millions of displacements.
She stated that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we have purified all the Syrian territory's two terrorist groups and "which strange presence is illegal."
The United States have a number of 2000 trops in Syria, especially to form and assist the core forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country struck for war.
On the assembly of the refugees, Muallem stated that the conditions were good for her return and had sined " some western countries" to scatter "irrational ports" that make the refugees want to keep loose.
"We have received the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," said.
"It's policying a subject that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opportunity to end war.
The diplomatics of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area at the last great rebellion, Idlib, has promoted the opportunity to continue with the political findings.
The Agreement between Russia and Turkey has evited a large scale of Syrian forces with Russia's help in the country, where three million people live.
Yet, Muallem noted that the agreement has some "experimental terms" and has expressed the hope that the military action will be front of Jihadistes, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front, connected to Al-Qaeda, that "they will be wrong."
Staff of Mistura, sending the United Nations, expects to invite the first meetings of a new committee for members of the Government and the opportunity to begin to profile a later constitution to the war and prepare the path to the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of participation of the Syrian government to the committee, the task of which should be limited to "Review the articles of the current constitution" and warned possible interferences.
Why Trump will win for the second time?
According to this logic, Trump would again win the elections in 2020, which, as many liberal spectaculars, probably wait, scannings and destitution process are fulfilled with their presidency in premature.
What would be, of course, "the end of a more dramatic presidency of the history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of spectators in a maximum audience has been doubled up to 1,05 million to the CNN and practically triplicated to 1,6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has a average of 2,4 million spectaculars in maximum audience, from 1,7 million years ago, under Nillen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", from MSNBC, has led the audiences of the television for box with 3,5 million experts in the main information nights.
"The people have seen up because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor", about a decree of the staff that happens to be the president when a attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran writer of comédia and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi traveling to Boston before the elections of 2016.
The taxist told him to vote Trump.
"Why?" asked.
"I answered that because she had been ridiculous," said Scovell.
There's a point of training in the caos.
Of course, in different ways of TV programs, the guidance out of Washington could determine the future of Roe V. Wade, if immigrants family can be gathered and the status of the world economy.
Disconnect is a luxury that only the most privileges spectators can be allowed.
And yet, being a town informed is to go further on the sixth hour when you find a group of experts to discuss the use that Bob Woodward made "private use" for his book "Fare", the structure jacket of 15,000 dollars of Paul Manfort ("un robe gross like his honour," tituled Washington Post) and the consequences of the horizont descriptions made Stormy Daniels of, Digue, the Trumpanato.
In my case, I'm not gonna see any more like Super Mario.
"The part of what it seems to be a part of a threat reality program is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars" on the changes of persons and guides of Trump's program (wheelling with the NFL, closing Kim Jong-Un).
You can't let you lose any episode because you stay back.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of 25 degrees and was just outside the house that has at the north side of Kauai, but it was closed by looking at the MSNBC while she recorded the CNN.
He couldn't be disappointed, not with Brett Kavanaugh to face the Court of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court with a child.
"I remember when we've done these programs then, and people say that it's the beginning of the end of the West Civilization," said Fleiss.
"I'm thinking it's a kind of smile, but it seems they're right."

Foreign money injure the courses of the legislative elections to the most adjusted representatives room
There is no surprise that there is an inundation of money infective at the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realization of the conventional districts that have done that two current members have to competite for the same place.
This recent resignation of Pittsburg's suburb region implies the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, which has received the place in another district after some special elections the past primary.
Lamb is faced to another current representative, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, which currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were repeated after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in the age that old districts were divided in unconstitutional way for the republicans.
The course for the new 17th district has developed a financial war between the major financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adapted victory in a very special election held on March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have built the charge for more than one decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the democratics a lie to the democratics.
The United States offer sanctions to the Salvador for their support to China, but they take them away
The diplomatics observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking, with a little answer by Washington.
Trump maintained a meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners were done out of the Trump Organization Management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to remove the heads of the United States diplomatic missions to Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for the "Recent decisions on the fact of not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, carried out of the department, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 aid from the United States of 140 million dollars, according to the estimations, for the control of drugs, development and economic improvements.
The saints proposed, including the financial assistance and restrictions in emergency lives, would be perjudicial for the Central American country and the high numbers of death for murder and war.
With the steps of internal meetings, the officers of all two countries have placed a meeting of high level centred in security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar foundation maintained in the past year, and it has seen as a step in order to prevent the emigrants to be guided to the United States.
But at the middle of September, high range of administration officials declared that they wanted that the meeting was produced, the fact that it ended effectively with any probability of sanction for the Savior.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, planned now for the average of October, as the sign of the importance that the administration is there, according to diplomatics.
The three US sentences returned to their carriers of Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions by Washington.
A portrait of the white house of Bolton refused to comment the details of the debate that described the three officials, including two diplomatics, which agreed to discuss the internal debts from anonymous.
A external analysis, close to administration and also from anonymous, corrupted the statements.
History Study
The next event could be the report of the special officer Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump in justice, of which there are many evidence in public records.
Mueller also researched whether Trump campaign cooperated with Russia in his elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump could find accounts in the organization, just when it is ready to do it before the voters, and even before a member of the party.
These are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's falling, or the head of his European humans, is inevitable.
There are decisions to take at all the two Atlantic rivers that will affect how long the situation will be.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to make a state against Hitler, only if the West Bloc had resisted him and had given support to the Checoslovaks in Munic.
We missed and lost the opportunity to escape all the years of terror that followed later.
The currency of the story on inflation points such as this and is accelerated or increasing the inexortable progress of democracy.
The United States face several inflation points currently.
What will happen if Trump attached to Rod Rosenstein, the general manager, the man who controls the destination of the investigation about Mueller?
Rosenstein was with the water in the cow since this journal reported that, in the past year, he suggested to register the president secretly and specifically that he was not appropriate for the carry.
Rosenstein says that the information of the Times is not necessary.
"How will we answer if the new investigation that the FBI requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court and the credible accusations of sexual and false witnesses?
And, especially, will we vote to half legislation a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we don't exceed these evidence, democracy will begin to be dangerous.
But I think we're not mistaken, because I've already learned the license in Praga.
My mother was a checoslovak Jewish deported to Auschwitz for the same national rule that was busy in the house of the campaign.
He survived, emigrated in the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to build Sabat's scales on that table with the Esvastick.

Graham Dorrans, of Rangers, face optimist at the game against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers repeat the Vienna Rapid, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after an empathy impressing the field of Vila-Real this month, would leave him in a good position to classify the G group of the European Ligue.
One lesson to the genol stopped that the Migcampist Graham Dorrans could play the first minutes of the time to the 2-2-real Villa, but you think Rangers can use this result as trampolis to get great results.
"It's a positive point for us, because the real Villa is a good team," said the player, 31 years old.
"We're playing the party believed we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have taken something more at the end, but, in general, it was probably a just result.
They were better in the first part, but we were better than they were at the second.
On says, it's another big night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it's gonna be a difficult party because they took a good result to the last party, but I'm sure we'll give it all and get a good result with the support of the office.
The last year was really hard, with the lessons I suffered and changed the club, but now it's a good place where I could be.
The team's good and the boys like it, training are good.
I hope we can give it all, leave the past time back and have success."
Women lose the sound for jubilation
Although the participants at the end had a clear idea of how they wanted to worry about them, some people talked to the family.
Nearly half of the inquiries at national level states that they have spoken with their couple of the cost of long-term attention.
Only 10% of the formers says he's talking to the children.
"The people want some family to take care, but they're not going to plant it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Safety Company.
We need to start here.
Talk to your parents and your children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t communicate your desires with enough anticipation.
Work with your assistant and your family to decide where and how to take attention, because these decisions may be a significant factor in time to determine the cost.
Include your financial assistant to the conversation: you can also help you to determine how to pay these expenditures.
Your financing options for your long-term care can include an insurance polysis for long-term care, a Hybrid Life Safety Polysis that helps you cover the expenditures or a safeguard with your own resources, if you have the money needed to do it.
Prepare your legal documents: remove the step to the legal battle.

Federal officers ask an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal officers in New York ask the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that was not applied to a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, presumptuously used a home Depot flight to fulfill an attack in a bicycle carrying from West Side Highway, to Lower Manhattan, and attract cars and cycles during his traject, in October.
In order to justify death crime, the officers have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused severe personal wounds, according to the event of trying to ask the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could suffer a death punish, according to the court document.
Weekly after the attack, a great federal jurisdiction attacked Saipov with a writer of accusation with 22 faults that included eight murders in the use of the organized crime, that the federal officers only use in maffia cases, more than a crime of violence and destruction of vehicles on motor.
The officers claimed that the attack required a "great planning and premediation" and described the way to act Saipov as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused ferides, danys and losses in families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruzi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandroan Damian Pagucco," says.
Five of the victims were Turists of Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time that the South New York District has brought a death case to judgment.
The question, Khalid Barnes, was condemned by the murder of two drug traffickers, but finally was condemned in perpetuous string in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case of New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being conspirated by conspiracy to perform the special actions for the Soviet Union during the Friday War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electronic chair on June 1953.
According to the Court documents, Saipov, birth of Uzbekistan, he did not demonstrate penalty in days and months later at the attack.
The police explained that she told the researchers that she felt good for what she had done.
According to the accusation writer, Saipov explained to the authorities who were inspired to fulfill the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked that the ISIS band was developed in his hospital room.
It was stated that it was not guilty about the accusation of 22 falls.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "absolutely deceited" with the decision of the accusation.
"We consider that the decision to ask death penalty, instead of accepting a statement of guilty and a perpetual string without freedom will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved people," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team was asked for the officers to not ask death.

NY's Mainder requests a couple for comfort after a "racist" message
A manner of New York declared a couple for a discriminatory accommodation after having received a bad text from the mother where he protested because he was "a other black person."
The couple refuses to be racists and to compare the question with a "extorsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, two children's mother, expressed consternation to see that the new manner, Giselle Maurice, was black when he came to work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA PERSONA NEGRA," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice, two times.
After admitting her pipe, a "incomfortable" Mrs Plasco-Flaxman took Mrs. Maurice, saying that the manner who had been comforted, who was African, had done badly her work and she expected a philpic person, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received the payment corresponding to her work day and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice calls to the couple a compensation for the accommodation and requests a compensation of, at least, 350 USD on the day for work with six months for which they had been contracted, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do things like this," he explained to the Friday Post, "I know that it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the statements that they are racistly aware that Maurice's aim was the most rare, because they were afraid they couldn't trust her after they had obtained her.
"My wife sent her something I didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at Post.
"But, would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been hungry, even if it's been wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, which compared the question with a "extorsion", said that her wife remained two months to have a baby and he was in a very difficult situation.
"You're going to follow something like that?
It's not a very favorable attitude," added the investment banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved, and the court of public opinion has pressed to declare the partner to social networks and to condemn their behavior and his logic.

He touched the ground on the birthday, when the children opened his gifts and he didn't look at them, nor looked at them."
He said that his death suspected a great trauma for them, but they have to work, "Don't open a forefather to the family.
You're kidding us.
But we have to continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is achieved by a child while the FBI starts a research
"I'm thinking that if we could get something as he asked (in a research with a ambition and a limited time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and also added that he feared that the committee was destroyed with the dead point of the partys.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republicans want a research of the FBI?
His reticence has to see at the moment.
Only five weeks for the half-management elections of 6 November. If, as it is expected, the republicans don't get good results, they will see debility at the time of getting that the man who wants to overcome the election will go to the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators and press them to gather Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, because he was your personal secretariat.
What will happen after the FBI creates your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where now there are 51 republicans and 49 demokrates.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to decline the empathy and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of soldiers in North Korea 'cau' with Kim
The number of soldiers in North Korea in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un has arrived in power seven years ago, according to a lawyer of South Korea.
Park Byeong-south, all citating data from the Ministry of the South Unification said that 127 deserts were produced in the past year, compared to the 2.706 of 2011.
Mr. Park said that the extreme border controls between North Korea and China and the increase of prices that cover the traitors of people have been the main factors.
You have not made a public comment.
Normally, most soldiers in the north are offered by the South Korean nationality.
The sources of Seul say that more than 300,000 north-coreans have developed the border illegally since the end of Korea's war in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea, and is easier to create that the democracy area (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrants in place of refugees and often repairs for strength.
The relations between North and South, technically still in war, have been considerablely improved in the last months.
In the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries gathered together to Pyongyang to maintain concentrated conversations in the stopped negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the history of June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to get a free nuclear energy peninsula.
But on the Sabbath, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, has sinned the US sanctions of the missing progress since the time.
"No trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not solve us first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a discussion in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that it's not an appeal to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber said that the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temperament was incapable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview in Texas Tribune Festival that celebrated in Austin, Texas.
"I can't let me think that if a woman had acted like this, they would have told her that it's a "historic," said Pelosi in relation to her reaction before the witness of Kavanaugh's before the Jewish Committee of the Sleus Senate.
Kavanaugh, emotioned, denied the accusations of being sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were young.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was shown very embarrassed, sometimes crying and remaining without words while he talked about his family and his years in the institution.
He also condemned the democratics of the committee, and said that accusations against him were supposed to be a "great and coordinated murder of a person" organized by the freedoms infringed because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections of 2016.
Perosis said that the witness of Kavanaugh proved that he couldn’t work in the High Court because he showed his prejudice against demokrates.
"I think he has dealed himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clintons and demokrates," he said.
Folosis showed rectifications when they asked if he was trying to impress Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the demokrates get the majority in the Representative Chamber.
"This is what I can say, if you don't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, it's not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now," commented Pelosi.
Currently, Kavanaugh acts as a judge to the Court of Application for the Circuit of the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as democratic, I was concerned about the decisions I could take Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe against Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation audience, he asked questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be deleted.
"It's not the moment that a historical person and with prejudice to enter the Court and hope that we look wonderful," said Pelosi.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatriba: months and years of fuel and can't take it without weeping.
"Let's pray when we're hungry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think you're still a little common.
He continued, "I helped a woman who was a executive in somewhere she said that she was also weeping when she was hungry, but she developed a tactic that was stealing at, when she was hungry and began to cry, tell the person who talked to me, "That you think I'm threatened because I'm weeping.
I'm hungry."
And then he continued.
He seemed brilliant."
The lacrims are allowed to go out to the Arabia in part because, basically, they are uninterpreted.
One of the most clearest records I have one of my first works in a office with a masculine majority, when one time I've finished weeping with an undescriptible Arabic, is the most biggest woman (a fresh directive that I always had been threatened a little) who took me from the clead and throwed me up to the eye of the scale.
"Never let them see you weeping," he said.
"They don't know you're wrestling.
They think you're threatened and they're happy because they're gonna have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who then was a Democratic Deputy of Colorado, was working with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramatrion adventure in a boat named Monkey Business and departed from the carrier, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason to explore the idea of she's representation as candidate to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-medied decision," he said to me while she was 30 years later.
"Yeah, there were seven other candidates in the carrier and the last thing they needed was another.
Somebody said, "Blanca and the seven kids."
As he arrived later to the campaign, he went around with the backup, so he promised that he wouldn't get to the street if he hadn't received 2 million USD.
It was a lost war.
He discovered that some of her party, who gave 1,000 USD to men were just ready to give her 250 to her.
"Did you think I've got a disappointment?" he asked.
When he preached his conversation and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so claimed for emotions (gratitude for people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty to get money and to direct to votants, instead of doing it to delegated, and the Arabic, and the sexism) that remained without words.
"I could have thought I had a nervous crisis," remembered Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the pressure.
"I could have thought that my body patrocinator was Kleenex.
I remember, what will they put in my tomb?
"Will you weep?"
As the trade war between the United States and China can benefit Pekín
The initial safeguards of the trade war between the United States and China were insorted and, although it doesn't seem that the war has to be successful, a lot of countries can be beneficial for Peking for a long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, sent his first warning to the beginnings of this year, when he imposed imposes to the main exports of China, such as the sun boards, the axes and the alumin.
The most significant scale has been produced this week, with new arnzels that affect products by $200,000 million, which are supposed to be imposed on the half of all goods that come to the United States from China.
The window has turned up every time in the same way and recently up the five-year-year-year-year-year-year-olds for 60,000 million USD welfare.
China has committed to replicate the United States, and it is not likely that the second largest world's economy becomes closely back.
In order to Washington make back conduct before some requests, but publicly incline before the United States would be too horrible for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Peking plays well their cards, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could benefit China a long term to reduce the interdependence of both economics.
"The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Peking could create conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is very dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a partner of researcher centred in Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is ready for the refugees, according to the Ministry of Foreign Assembly
Syria says that it is prepared for the voluntary return of the refugees and requests help to rebuild the country, destroyed for a war over seven years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Assembly Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are improved.
"Now, the situation on the street is more stabil and safe, thanks to the progress that has been done in battle against terrorism," said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists have disturbed to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country have been fulfilled by terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affect their day-time life and their maintenance.
The EU calculates that over 5,5 million Syrians have fled from the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime thanks every help to rebuild the desolated country.
But he declared that he would not accept a conditional assistance or the assistance of the countries that funded insurgency.
Europe's selection allows the victory to Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe has received the Ryder Cup of 2018 to destroy the North American election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 to Le Golf National, in Paris, France.
The United States have already lost six consecutive times in Europe and won not Ryder Cup to Europe since 1993.
The European election regained the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14,5 points necessary to win the United States.
The North American Phil Mickelson star, who fighted during the majority of the tourist, took the out of the water to the street 316, what happened to the victory in Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari golfist bricked all its series and became one of the four players who had got 5-0-0-0 since he started the current format of the tour in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5 and 4 for the less quality player from the European Thorbjorn Ollesen election, Danish.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, England, which could have played his last Ryder Cup.
He's going to get him with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest winter that the tour has ever been, with 25,5 points of carrier.
"I'm not just crying, but I can't stop it today.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believe me.
I'm so happy, so happy I've got the coffee.
The team is the most important... and I'm happy to have helped," an emotional Garcia began after the European victory.
He passed the relief to his compatriote John Ram, who destroyed the lead of the North American golf Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single concurrence of the Sunday.
"I'm incredible to have win Tiger Woods, I grow after him," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost the four party in France, and now he's got a carrier record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players that existed, with 14 big titles and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
North America's choice struck all the head of a week to search for the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high category golf during all the tour.
The North American Captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the frustrating of his team, "I'm honourable of these players, they fight.
This morning has been a moment when we pressed the European election.
We fighted.
I'm taking the boat for Thomas.
It's a big captain.
Their 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, we'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm honourable to have been his captain.
It's got to take the bar.
He destroyed us."
