The Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the Liberation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament refused, in the framework of an amendment to the Penal Right, the draft annullment of the paragraph on the inculption of Julia Tymosenko, the chief of the opposition.
The deputys rejected the draft amendment on the reduction of the pains for economic delays, which could open the doors of freedom for the ex-Prime Minister currently undertaken.
Tymosenko was condemned in October to 7 years of prison to conclude a disavanced priority agreement with Russia for natural gas achievement.
The judgment is not definitive, and the court must state on the call of the sentence in December.
Tymosenko qualified the political vindication of the regime and proposed a process of partiality of the Court also at the west.
The draft to reject paragraph 365 of the penal right, on the basis of which the ex-Premier has been condemned, was signed by 147 deputy.
He would have had 226 voices to approve it.
Libanon Victoria
Liberation or Rebellion Libanon has already been winning.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war is finished.
He's staying to determine the guests.
As it is costume in the region, the choice wingers are islamists, but it is modelled or radically.
The National Provisory Council declared the standard law of the Charia and we already know what it is.
Libia becomes a country without criminality because for a flight the hand is cut off.
Women can forget the emancipation, the unresponsible events of her faith are passible from capital pain...
It is the Coran who will join the personality of the director the composed company of opposite tribes.
Libia will rule such orders as we can't represent it and we wouldn't like it.
But our way to live is not unique, it is not the best, and it would probably not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly amazing that the Islamist Wars have accepted aid with recognition of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not a American general that leads the OTAN's flags, but God, whom they glorify the greatness of every attack.
So when it's looking for the vendors in Libya, western is not part of it.
We participated in the shoes, served the islam and our politicals turned away from the dictator as a political aliance without that it brings no benefit.
After the recent evil experiences of the Afganistan and Iraq, we do not work militaryly in Libya.
So there is no problem for locals to disappear the "crossed".
Is that without occupying the sun, petroliar society will be easily accessed to the black libiane gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to prevent a human rights designated protection.
Unfortunately, we can stop these chair's adeptes.
A new time of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the vision of investors.
A review of the statistics has passed in March on Europe.
Each of the states has published information on the PIB for the 3A.
The Czech Economic has established this last trimester, while France and Germany are growing.
The obligatory market takes all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The offices of the statistics of the Eurozone, the Germany, the Czech and other countries in Europe have published their views for the third trimester of economic development.
The PIB of Germany has a growth of 0,5%, the of France of 0,4%.
The two countries have changed the data for the second trimester during which Germany has been better laid down (in place of 0,3% in place of 0.1%), however, France has made a lower decrease of 0,1% (the stagnation origin was issued).
The Czech Economy has increased 1,5% during the third trimester.
However, the PIB has set up and, according to the Office of the Czech Statistics, it is confirmed that it is leading to a progressive reduction of economic growth.
The results are worse than analyst previsions.
The most important events:
The Czech Economic has increased 1,5% during the third trimester, but has stanged during the last trimester.
The German economy has increased 0,5% in the third trimester according to the periodic and periodically calculated data.
The Economic of the Euro and the European Union has increased 0,2% between July and September in relation to the previous trimester, which corresponds to what the analysts had proposed.
Greek economy was struck from 5,2%.
The reward on the obligations for ten years is 28,45%
The rewards of the obligations of Spain and Italy are training to critical limits.
Problems start to hear in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The rewards of the Czech obligations are maintained below 4% while the situation in the region is empire.
Vots are listed in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
Checs have been qualified for the EU.
They win in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate quality for 200 million
The representation of the football has succeeded the most difficult mission of the saison!
In Montenegro, she also wined the super Cech and the guard Peter Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech Football has also defenced a good part of chance in the second part of his quality and will not miss the campaign of Europe.
IHNED.cz followed the match of qualification with a detailed report.
No particular excitation during the first part and a large part of chance for the second.
The Czech Representation also wins the super Chech and the hero Peter Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its quality to the campaign of Europe.
Montenegrains were found under pressure until in the second part because of a specific technical defence.
The match's victimes were Damjanovic and Vucinic who struck two chances to mark a target.
And thanks to super Peter Cech, the Czech Representation will not be absent to the campaign of Europe in the next year, and more than a reward of 200 million corony in the box of the Czech Football.
Since the first minutes we played a football war.
The two teams were hard to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not been made to perceive the Chec Defence that has responded specificly to long shoes even during the first mid-times.
Iran students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They've created a human puzzle
Some hundreds of high school students have created a human bucle around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country with an accidental Israeli attack.
Students prayed at midday before the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
Some hundreds of students in Spain universities have created a marginal human boulder around the nuclear technological center of Spain where the urinium is transformated.
They have thus expressed openly that they will defend the nuclear programme of their country in the loss of their own lives.
The International Agency for Atomic Energy (AIEA) has been in its last information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There is a possible attack of Iranian nuclear institutions in Israel.
Students prayed at midday before the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, which would be the objective to destroy the Iran nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz website where the urinium is enriched.
The food of a obsessed child: not take a little dinner and take charquery for food
More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 years have surpower problems, 9% of the choices have a pest over the average and 5% are obsolete.
As the current research shows, obedient children are of families who have a disease style of life.
This shows how important it is the environment in which it develops being human and models around it.
On the tables of the obedied children are, for example, 50% often more than in the family of children in normal pounds.
19% of the obsess had fresh food according to the investigation made with a sensibilisation action "The Obesity is not a hazard"
In the small families the sport is also not a habitude, which is now the case of most schools today - only 15% responded that at least one week parents found the time for active movement.
Research of 900 children
The investigation was deployed during the last school year and participated 900 students from the primary schools in Czech.
It was the second editing of "Obesiness is not a hazard", action supported by the General Health and the Uniles society.
From the beginning, there are more than 12000 students of six to the third, which have been added to this project.
One of the determined factors that provoke dramatic increases of the number of children in superpoids, seen obsession, is the absence of a correct food and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the issued children indicates, for example, to eat five times a little dinner at the day - to meet - a dinner, which is a basic principle of a good food," indicates one of the results of the research.
Without a little lunch and charcuter at the dinner
Specialists take care of the fact that to have a healthy development needs a few basic details such as a small dinner in the same hour.
In Czech, only 23% of the student families eat at the same hour.
In the largest part of the family, everyone takes his little dinner alone.
And the worst that has been raised is that one tenth of the population doesn't take a little dinner.
The little lunch is, however, the basis of a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obedied children are more frequently consumed by malsaine fridge.
Almost every league - without talking about pest - drinks every day of sucred drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children concerned are regularly sports but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the research allowed children (204 boys and 172 daughters of 13 schools) to prepare their own food from the possibilities proposed according to their own benefit and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of the Checs children of 12 to 15 years are far from a healthy food, ideal."
There are many gases, meat and sugars among their favorite plastics.
"The most alarming is particularly a great preference for the sucred limonates," is indicated in the results of the investigation.
To celebrate this is the pieces that took the first place just before the white flesh.
The children do not have any desire of feeding and preference for fishing and feeding feeds was very low.
Health Leader
The research also showed that children are ready to change their standards since they receive ad hoc information.
"In a control of a group of participants in the research that had completed the questionnaire after the "Obesitivity is not a hazard," was addressed to a well-determined wish to lead to a healthy food," indicated the results of the investigation.
The most marking was, for example, related to the supply limonates because the children began to give the preference for consumption water.
Children have most often watched on the questionnaire the white flesh and fish as the main platt and reduce the sucres and the "knedliky" (special technology of bread bottles of bread or ground pockets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In an article of presentation on the way to learn for the stylists, I made a little wrath of the fact that there was a lot from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what happened afterward.
The exposure of three professionals of speciality, the ability of personality and a seminar on what is happening.
And it'll be worse.
Moreover, we approach Final Examinations and more expect practices and information.
And even when there's the same and lunch courses, it's actually "brore".
This time we have with Alenka's Director (with there is no boy) treated with the way to explore a woman who doesn't have standard measures.
And the women of this guy's is the majority.
One has a little cock, another one of a kids body, without a particular corner, another of the superpoids.
The stylist needs to know how optically increase wide arms, prolong a cow or well to add needed curves.
Thus, we have come to sublime the personality and also not to have a very wide way of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong poetrin and pronounced branches and a finish size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hazards of such a way that eggs or pantalons do not pass over all, it is the reason to make it in measure.
And you don't react it because the pack that falls impressively is inestimable.
In a ship on measure you will feel much better than in that who slips permanently, runs and doesn't hold on the ceinture and then.
For those who have a masculine appearance may allow a Tucker style packing, with coususes sticks, or even broders.
Of course there are many examples of different learning and I am happy that I have the whole week to sort all the information received.
But I'm too afraid you're thinking about what I have to do to the house there's too much.
Each stage has a celebration for the day and evening.
We must consider the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I'll be "habiting"Miranda Kerr, that you might know of the campaign the Victoria Secret.
In the bottom of me, this makes me happy, because it's better to have British Spears, Christina Aguilera who took about 100 kilos of these last time (not take my statement, svp, completely serious) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and cover from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as it says for the final result, expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphical creation.
Think also on the graphical part of the styling is important.
The stylist is not only the physical but creates, for example, productive pages in the magazines (for products given the trends for manufacturers, containers, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and a graphist, we had all this.
But this,... until lunch.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three invitations from the speciality have given a diversified aspect at the Sabbath meeting full of information on the various types of personality.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka graphist mode and Ben Renc, mode photographer.
Jacob reminded us that the mode is an illusion and the stylist should know it.
And a talent stylist can work with a single difference in different ways.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this trench-coat that should be taken classically with a jean and a t-shirt as a lower clothe, but he can also cut the nub, with scarpins and take it in a photograph as a clothe.
Or it's enough to remontate the manches or colt and have immediately a new look.
"Just with that" he's underlined.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know perfectly the rules."
"You can then start against it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, in what, why, while in mode magazines, sometimes we see something else.
No statement on mode defilements.
I know again, by the photograph of Ben mode, that the stylist must have much more fabric variants than those who are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story that will have a decade of pages (in addition to a decade of models) I must be ready to be "retaler" at least one quince.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely different than reality.
We have to count with it during a model.
The fact that the image and style often make the half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna who's not a super song but his image and marketing made it a world star.
In Czech, the approach to the use of stylist services remains still fresh.
And the famous faces sometimes considered them as inutiles (sufficiently I know something but what I stopped to the second range).
And if someone makes a styling of our part, then we must count on the fact that he says us with a great probable importance of a totally different size (because small) than that he has reality.
Then we're going to ship on google and ensure if the boulevard information makes the celebration in question, if she has magre or big etc...
Honza and Mario put us Sunday on the heart that it's not enough to the stylist to orientate in the mode and to assemble models.
He needs to communicate with the people he has and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Aware of being people, don't slow down, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to arrange his armor and to fill her new elements, you can't throw everything and tell him, my God, what fear."
"You will find some business you will find happy and he you will advise with what to bring them," said Mario.
This has shown us particularly what we need to contain everything that is called "placovka" or "sc of the stylist".
It's the one you're going around the size and you're on yourself for everything you need.
Further than the clearly defined as cycles, the roles for depilation or even food epilings are also found of the nilon floor (which the stylist used for photographing products such as sacks, or even chapeaux), special clips with which it is closing a clothing in the dose, if it is too large (the epilingle or another type of agraf is not useful because they could be able to cover the clothing) or a good cotture kitchen.
That we are not only people who listen but who have tried something practically, they have taught us how to recall correctly the chaussures.
And during the camera session in the athleir where the surface is equal, the seed could be busy, for the reader.
And so we collected and collected.
We did not have the right to touch the cycles to do not hurt by inevitably.
That is why it really needs competences.
Mario made me happy when he blessed me for my creation.
The account that I'm doing is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small sum of what we learned during the second weekend
I'm starting to understand that the styling profession is not a promenade in a rose garden, but everyone says what he wants.
The need of speed The Run is discussed throughout all America.
Revision
The origin of an unproblemous course is transformed because of a total of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do in a routine morning movement to work.
This is fulfilled until a certain measure the ambition of each one, but it doesn't serve anything if nobody wants to do anything more.
The new party subtitled The Run produced great attitudes before his exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the Need for Speed series already older and out a sort of game from playable parts that would not be considered only with points.
We were therefore curious how to be the r passions added during which the main heroes out of his car and do what he lived.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what we expected.
These are potentially arcade course games but the entire shoot down because of some unusing errors already existing a few years ago.
They are not really mistakers but the expression of an incomprehensible failure of the developers.
The event begins very well.
You are taken in the adventure where the main hero Jack has characteristics and to set them to participate in illegal courses through America.
You sit behind the floor on the west side in San Francisco and your mission is to get the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
It is divided in ten steps and then more than 50 courses.
The results that each course is made on another inheritance and steps provided in different environments that are very different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel the only moment that the game offers him something of identical.
Some environments are so joyful even if the graphical technical level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the world's worst.
But the training through the wilderness, in lands of grounds, or well in highly denied mountains, is very pleasant.
The tests are in more time in agreement of an atypic enlargement.
For example, in the wilderness, you will find you in a sable temperate that you are sensitively reducing the visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an albanese doesn't fall on you.
On the other hand, the different courses are well organised behind the others.
There's just a little number but that's enough.
There are moments you will try to override the number of requested adversaries (come in a classic course) and then you will run against the monster (classical deal with the chronometer) and then you will wait for another dual with an adversary.
You also have the police that enters into the game and who trys to make you the difficult situation.
The news are traveling out of the vehicle.
It's more than an interactive animation when most of the time Jack's gone before someone and you need to help him stick on the good button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less moments of that type than what you expect (for be considered only three).
The result is like that because this element does not risk to be generous and place in the context above, in the elements that enjoy the game.
The training model is in the tradition of the previous games.
This means that now there is nothing extraordinary but we can't say that it's negative.
For real simulation, you should go to see otherwise.
But although we can find it better in competition, the conduct model will be very well with the type of course conception.
So it's all right.
Problems begin to appear after a certain time.
In the differences of the conduct model, the collisions are not yet at the point.
We don't wait for this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the idea of how your car is comported, so it's not completely good.
During the serious passions you sometimes touch mutually easily but otherwise your car part in fools.
Or you'll find it in the middle.
Thanks to the restart system, this is not really a problem but it really dos you.
The restart is made so that when you're cut off the figure or you've gone out in the decoration the game returns you at the last point on the entire point.
But you don't just have five restarts.
When you used the 5 restarts you must start the game from the beginning.
So it's another tool, for the case something doesn't happen as necessary, that somebody on which you can really count.
Sometimes the restarts don't help and need to find the solution to remember the inheritary track that is concerned.
The big here of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some virages that we need to pass in a certain way if it doesn't happen.
Furthermore, you will meet on a place given by vehicles "civils" always in the same configuration you get first, fifth, 5 seconds forward or a minute later.
What makes wrath is the situations when you see easily traveling the adversary between two cars coming in inverse and when you arrive, you need to put yourself on the side and turn them off or wear them well.
It's equal to if you're going before him because it's "called" so that for the situation he's always coming near your neck.
The adversaries still have other benefits.
During all the time of the game, you will come in some places, again without respecting the time, and you always have the same adversarie that predicts you at the same place.
This energys the most end of game when you roll on a long pound inverse.
The adversary must pass before you.
When it passes before you, he hides the view of other vehicles inverse and enters a lot of times in collision.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captive and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you're hurting you quickly.
And it's crazy because through a simple conduct model the game is interesting and the places with a lot of action you don't have time to follow everything is happening.
And it's equal if it's due to the concept of 50 unique inheritors, that the order of courses is like there's no chance to curse or something else .
The original idea is the change of car during courses.
You must be careful to the inherent pomps because you can change cars, but most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided in three categories.
The sport cars are ideal for cities, the large American cilindros for the right-outs and the super sport cars for exotic attorneys on very technical conducts, for example, on the lake routes in the mountains.
And the mode of deficits, which are courses in particular places you know about the event, will be very well with the main story regime.
You receive not only medicines but also experience points that are added to your profile that is common to deficits and events.
When you get the highest driver level, various objects start locking:
This connects on-line to the Autolog function that compares your results obtained with other players and makes you other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult couples to understand is the situation of the last course of the event.
You're coming with your car in the tunnel of the metro (see it looks like) where you roll in the darkness on the ways (see seem).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/hour (forward) and behind you get a metro rame that sends you the car directly to the ferry.
In the reaction we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone really thinked about the creation of this game or even if the authors really take us for imbéciles.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is in general pleasant and in some cases really super.
The genre is that in extreme circumstances, the image does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This concerns especially accidents with a lot of participants when a fluid imagery will not serve you any more.
The sound part is good and the track is on the choice.
In the purpose of pleasure to the greatest and especially the youngest, a new song track has been created in the style "I mean everything," but we can expect that no one will get the game for music.
General print of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confused.
If the game hadn't had these stupid errors, we could say without fear that it was the best NFS production of these last years.
But this game gives the impression to not be finished.
The amusement is really good but prepare for you that the faults put you in the eyes with the strength of a aircraft reflector.

Vicenov, Ambassadrice near the European Union:
The Chess belongs to negatives and euroseptics
"Lissabon Treaty has radically removed the equivalence between institutions"
"I didn't expect a war so hard."
"This will be 5,6 years before the situation is quiet and that all the players are usually in their new role," and Milena Vicenov has started its exhibition to the Faculty of Justice the Chess Ambassadez near the European Union.
When she had successful to describe the different EU bodies and their relations so understandable and visible, at the point that a large number of conferences of the rights of the University of Charles could send it, she showed what point she has taken her word "comprehensible and openly on Europe" to seriously.
Madame Vicenov has made up the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"After the beginning, the critics he's fair, that it's a round-quarter, that he can't fill any mission and I have to say he's cut off the suffering to everyone because he holds his role to perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, even to communicate with them and have a clear view of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the framework of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step to the unity and a greater liberality of the EU policy in respect of states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants us to interrupt our syrecky (cookie feeding that feels very strong)
Ms. Vicenov also made the agenda living, living, and lived in a nearby time the European Council.
She qualified the Czech President of two years ago.
Checs have resolved the quantitative financial crisis, the gas crisis or well organized a summary for an Eastern Partenariat.
She carried out the challenge of the Government of very negative and raised the picture of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Representation in the EU is now very busy.
According to the words of Madame the Amassadrice, "Activity has struck his full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
Moreover, the new seventh budget of the Union is to be very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be small and small, in the view of economys, which branches will be the priority, which countries will at least be helped in the future negotiations.
Madame Amassadrice reminded his slogans with which it came to Brussels "For a comprehensive Europe."
"I really don't like abbreviations, stranger words, jargons that nobody understand.
As the citizen must understand that he is true that in Brussels nobody does run or tortured cornichons, bananas are very different, or no one has prohibited us to make syrecky."
She wants to use the EU environment and see more than Czech in the European institutions.
A number of speeds in Europe waiting for us
According to the Amambassadrice, the Czeches have the reputation of to be Euroseptics and people who don't see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, it is sorry to see a so small chechical representation in the European institutions.
The fault results, according to it, of many factors, such as the timide of our candidates, their incapable to write a letter of motivation and a lower support of the Czech Party.
Furthermore, a Czech Presidency has then sublined the strength and cooperation of the Vicegrad Group.
"Remember me, when the Poland, the Magyar, the Slovakian, said this French, "Hey, what are you doing in there, what is this group of Visegrad yet doing?" But it is not all content."
According to Madame Vicenov, in a near future, these are new rules of severe budgetary policy expecting Member States.
It's the concept of a European to two speeds, if it's in a number of speeds, which prevents more than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others out of the area."
"We have the Schengen space, we also have the strengthened cooperation institution."
In the first place, he was said that the countries who want him were cooped among them, and those who desired him remain in their coast."
"There will be many institutions of this type and there will be a real Europe at two speeds," Mrs. Vicenov expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases in which all the subjects with an impact on the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not only the eurozone members.
History of a mark:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expressed closer to the IBM strategy, the nearest would be "the long term."
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of technological revolution, it is a firm ressentation as very current, but since its creation it has been exceeding hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was taken by the first chief of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a lot of world problems can be regulated for a little while people want to think.
His slogan "PENSE" became the headquarters around which will develop the life of a future gender (and also the title of the internal magazine IBM started editing in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company, which was hardly developed by Watson.
IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements guided to the future.
IBM has survived hundred years through the fact that she remains loyal to her base values, but it has not been afraid to change all the other around her.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technologies, business and society.
We hope that in the second century, we are still going to get more" for the anniversary, the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A good system prepared
Watson, in the thirty-year years, began to take care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were only among the first American employees to have the vacances paid, a guarantee paid by the employee a more elegant employee uniform and a well-employed reward system for inventors and commercials.
In the same way IBM has a system of relationships with the well-employed client.
The society was at the beginning of talents, as one of the first firms who had absolved all forms of discrimination and could have been choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of anti-discrimination strategy since this is a Virginia Rometty woman - which should replace Palmisano to IBM's head.
This works in IBM for thirty years and is currently occupied by the Board of Ventes, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in the past years has done what is called Jamy, the online brain storing from which many future strategies and innovations have been issued.
It's not amazing that he has many ideas - in the firm there are about 500000 people working.
An institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the business that assessed him a safe position in the areas of business.
"After the beginning of IBM, IBM had a concept more than a technical firm," says Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economic in Harvard Economic School and author of the IBM book.
"IBM is not a firm technology but a firm that helps to resolve the problems of the business world using its technologies," added Geogre Colony of the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm said, there is a difference to enter into the market and create this market.
IBM - or even the "Blee Blee" as she named familyly in the United States - she has grown up to one of the largest world firms.
It is obviously the most polyvalent technology - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructures, housing, Council services at the level of the server's products to the nanotechnology.
She has many letters from all American technological firms and five of her employees received a Nobel price.
The distributor of ballets, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the discets.
IBM has found this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technological firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first is Apple), when for the first time it is over in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview forward
This is not all innovations and manufactures that have received the preference of the client and time - IBM, for example, has not succeeded on a own OS/2 operational system, of the Internet Prodige or well of the IBM PCJr computer:
"On the time your business is built on the movement in the past you can't be emotionally acrossed on the past," to note Samuel J. Palmisano.
IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they don't work.
In the differences, for example, the Microsoft competitors who are on the basis holding and remaining under the Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM income, services formed for a fifth by software and hardware have a prepondered place.
However, yet in 1990, she was with more than the most strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM sold low rewards for 15 billion dollars, she invested 58 billion dollars in the achievement of perspective technology.
She continued in investments and even since 2008, when she first overlied the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the prescriptions of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased its investment volume during the great economic crisis.
Is it then that IBM passes the current crisis without being concerned?
The IBM Action Price has proceeded from 2008 to 120 per cent, and the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The IBM firm logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect that this flexible genius of other crisis.
IBM's history: From training trains to the vols in the cosmos.
The IBM company (IBM International Business Machines) was born in New York for hundred years ago; she had initially the complied name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name of IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a sucursal of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the fusion of four firms which the history is linked to the 80th century.
They had technology, such as the old "potents", the pendules that recorded the arrival and department of the employees.
The architect of the new society was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was President of the Soviet Survey Council until 1930.
Flint built the chief of a competitive firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the society.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it is about the ideas of Watson that replace the identity and the culture of the society.
Watson leads the firm even in 1952.
IBM, according to his name, begins with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - wooden and meat trains to recorded boxes.
During the first four years where Watson was leading, the number of businesses was multiplyed up to achieve 9 million dollars and started the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so unrecommendable that after 40 years of direction he was his son who's busy with the manager, Thomas Watson Junior.
In its IBM direction, the development of artificial intelligence started and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, people and IBM computers helped NASA leading the flights in the cosmos - on Mercur, Saturne and in 1969 the floor on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM develops the first computer family - IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
20 years later IBM sells his computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but buys the Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of counsel and services with a highly added value.
The IBM strategy the last three years - the Smarter Planet concept is "a more intelligent planet".
It is the intelligence of technologies in non-exploited areas such as transport and management of cities.
In the case of IBM trade, there has been some time developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform which helps trade managers all trade cycles.
IBM has also a strong story on our territory.
She created her sucursal in Checoslovaquia in 1932, then the first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, outside IBM RT, there is also the strategy center of Brno outsourcing.
The Central and Eastern Europe sits in Prague, and there is also the world-wide research and development team that is concerned about the recognition of the word.
Richtarava about his unbelieving husband:
You can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Riychtarova (53 years) said, it's done!
After his husband Joseph Ricktar (53 years) was kept the body and loved Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina would hope that Joseph would rise from his rose dream and return to home.
Only she could not wait and establish clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarova.
When Darina Richtarova gave asset in Bartosova in her house, she wouldn't doubt that her couple wouldn't have.
When Iveta 30 days later insists to move from Ricany, Pepa did not stop the song.
And he's in public that he loved him.
Since Darina was resigned, he accepted his husband's connection and ended by saying to him additive forever.
Richtirova isn't interested to know who his husband sleeps.
If Richtar and Bartosova seem to be seen there's no wife to accommodate him on the door of the house.
"It's the biological father of my son, and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put it out."
"It will not be my old age loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," left Richtarova filtering, showing that she was detailed from her husband but that they remain only in a decade relationship.
The fact that Darina closed his door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife put a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The society continues, I'm busy with repairs, gardens, immobiliers, I'm busy."
"Because Darina is totally normal but we don't sleep together," said Richtar for Blesk.
If Richtarova finds a new love, he wouldn't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and he doesn't interest me to know where she goes, with whom and if she has a link.
I know that it's my fault, I've fallen lovely from Iveta and I take all the responsibility on me," Joseph concluded.
The women's worst victories: Does this also concern you?
If you ask men to determine typical vials of women, all, like the others, are able to get them out of their missing.
My beloved ladies, you're going to know in the following lines of women's victorias that come to blow the blood of men's vineyards.
Accounts
Your half makes you comments that you are dependent on the achats?
Do you have to buy at least one week clothes?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of soldiers?
In your case, we can talk about acheters as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their patience to make a bunch.
But you will say, what would be at the lie-vitrine of clothes, looking for yourself of beautiful clothes, and then try them all in the cabin (the idea of different colors)?
And although for most women's buying is a hobby, this can become a real hell for the man.
Remember how many times you told your partner that he's waiting for the entrance...
Insatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big?"
"I'd have to make a sport at least 5 kilos -- I'd have to start to do sport?"
"I like you?"
Didn't they remind you of anything?
Yeah?
You are therefore part of these women obeyed by their appearance.
It's not the question that you should stop to take care of yourself, but a lot of men is allergic because their partners are always in the way to declare their appearance.
The strong sex does not have to say that more the frequency of these statements increased and more women become impressive.
In the first place and property
It's like an infinite treatment.
Lower windows, pass the aspirator, clean the sun, make the pool, deck the bathroom - and it's twice a week.
You make notes to your partner that he walks with sales feet on his own ground, the kids who have gone the lavabo, broke the vitre of the room, and what is that gives you a lot of work?
If you suffer exactly of this obsession, try to have the spirit that there is nothing to do and that order and property should not be in the first place in the family.
This inoffensive desire of property may, however, gain your relations and even family peace.
The Scientific Work
"But this survey used to the pool."
"Do you have to put these old shots still tomorrow?"
"A moiled service has nothing to do on earth."
If you do this work of knowledge on your partner in this way several times per day, you will really decompose it.
It is obvious that you don't think evil you want to be emphasisable.
Maybe if the men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much of science work...
The diamation, the persisting
Difference, persistence, but also insultes against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly carried out to relationships, and so they are happy to treat subjects such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us let us escape a little inoffensive persuasion here and there.
The hand on the heart is, however, a particularity of women.
But the worst is those who advise, persuading, even disturbing others, and are for them - particularly to work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hokeyist Jagr attacked twice at Philadelphia's victory during the lunch NHL match on the Caroline glass and is again on the head of the productive chess players for the concourse.
From the view of the star of 39 years of Claude Giroux, who still made a more pass and was called the best player of the match, he marked in both cases.
Jacob Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also recorded two objects during the match.
Jagr after the match said to the south-atlantic journalists that he had predicted Giroux that it would be a big evening.
"I told him before the match he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Any time this feeling you fall up" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marks a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
One minute later there was a second assault of the Czech team.
Voracek fighted behind the targets of the Hurricane for the palette and presented it to the Maxime Talbot board.
One second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a decent, but the beginning of the second part is apparent to Flyers.
Specially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr it marks three objects, then Wayne Simmonds becomes a fourth object.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean that he's the best player of the language but he's really part of the three best," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play a carrier at the end with a hokeygist like him."
"I'm really happy of that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other team players tried to play on me, now it's my tour," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drame of this match because with a target of Tuom Rutu and again Dwyer on a penalty shooting she ends with a different difference of a goal.
Matt Read didn't disappear other complications that end two against one.
"Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area."
"He took on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most far from the box.
"I've tried to shoot him and I'm here," describes the last goal of his view of Voracek.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory in the East Conference.
The Czech Defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek has not finished the match with Buffalo in second territory because of a wound in the top part of the body.
Canadians have not held face to a defender experienced their presence of two buckets were lost after a penalty shooting by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that especially built the local intrainer instead of lost pounds because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We just played the match with a experimental player, the rest was young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement this has not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We had just to simplify the game, put the palette out of our area."
For this, we had limited, "he added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Chec Defender, took part of the third attack of Winnipeg and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters have participated owx objects of Jets, which have stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices Developed since 1989
Before 1989, there were only 5 state travel agents in Czechoslovaquie: Cedok, Sportrist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time proposed travels especially in countries of socialist blog, because the travelways to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for vacances in Eastern Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimee and Black Mer), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Northern Mer) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period of 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel in Yougoslavia, then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and traveling to Yougoslavia was very limited for the Chinese tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist time was that it was not authorised to the civilians of the socialist block (except for the Checoslovacs) to travel individually in the framework of socialist countries.
In the case where the Czechoslovac would like to travel individually in Poland or in the Swiss Union, he needed a letter of invitation if the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offer travels to West, however, it had to make the cup all night with a cooking sack or have a "nice knowledge" within the travel agent.
And even after that, it wasn't won yet.
The agreement for the advice that was the conditions to travel to the West was refused to people "incorrectly politically" who couldn't be able to travel.
However, the Checoslovac monkey was not changing, and it was not possible to obtain financial measures without the agreement of devises (west monkey) to travel to the west.
The Czech reached the most frequently their vacances in the country where there were so many campaigns and challenges that the Czech reached and this hard habit until now.
The Czech Travels have known a great revolution since 1989.
Although the vacances in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the maximum of 1989, the Czech reached the last year in the foreign four million days of vacances in the whole world.
The great paradox we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go free to 1989 because part of the Yougoslavia of the age.
The elimination of visa in the 1990s of the past century in the neighborhood countries of the west have offered a large vague of long-term visits in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Checoslovaquis couldn't travel for a long time at the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, the travel organizations made the Checs to sleep in tickets in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical train of a travel from Czech was at that time to export with himself his own food conservation, saucesson, etc. to economic.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech core that allowed our tourists finally after ten years of power freely to buy the western monkey.
Our life level and the average payment have increased what has proceeded around 1997 another important moment.
With a growing request for traveling, travel agencies have started from 1997 to prepare tours with aircraft connections, which have been increasingly reduced the costs in relation to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s of the past century, the Czechs had no visa links with practically the majority of the developed countries of the world part of the EU that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air carrier was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as each year of direct aircraft charters bring chess tourists in the farmers; this hiver will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It's more than 100000 Czechs who visit exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development has arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU has removed the visions for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to be fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs for the first time in the history have passed more than half of their vacances in the foreign (50,3%) and for the first time in the history, more than 15,000 corners per person for for foreign vacances, including annexes.
The General Assembly must find his President, but it is risking to end in a situation without a "path" solution.
Before 5 months, the Czech Football is without President, and it risks that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a general Assembly that must be developed in Nymburk.
However, there is no agreement in accordance with which vote Regulation must be processed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Paclik are interested by the direction of the Chec football.
Hasek gave his demission in June and during his department called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will guide the football in the future.
Only after Hasek, the football was returned back to differences between the Association rooms that could not agree with a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when he had to choose a new President.
The delegateds of the General Assembly were in use in the National House in Prague because the negotiation was blocked, and it was not even questioned to treat an electronic way.
There was no agreement on the fact that it had the right to vote to the General Assembly - only the State representatives or also the officials of full powers.
In this single point there was a party agreement since this time with the Affairs of the Office for the State and the Right, in which the representation on the basis of the full power is not possible.
The differences continue to continue in respect of the election Regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which has not contributed nothing more to the situation in its planned or extraordinary negotiations.
The opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third tour to not fall into the path.
"The disorder pomme remains in the following case: or procedure according to statutes or well find another model," one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents the professional football in the Association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third turn of the candidates who have received the most property in the room for which it is candidate.
The Moravie is ready according to what it was said to get away to win the candidate who will receive the greatest percentage of the voice of the two rooms.
And the Czech Party studies the conditions that the vendor should have the two thirds at least the percentage of vote.
"Only this would lose the idea of two previous tours and it would be completely refused to the bicameral concept," advised Svoboda, which includes the objections of the moral party and that the best would not change the Regulation and vote according to the enforced statutes.
It is surprised that Tomas Paclik is also agreed even if it is considered that the regulation of elections established according to the most beneficial statutes of Pelta among all candidates.
"I want to vote at maximum in accordance with the statutes of association."
"Because there is no sacred ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is candidate for the first time and who has been particularly defined in his exhibitions against Pelta.
The rest is optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk, there will be a new President and believe that candidates will cooperate in the future together and in constructive ways.
"The potential qualification in Europe should be quiet everybody."
"The football will be again on a happy weight and there will be more inside for a cooperation" adds the office of Jablaec, which among the three has the greatest experience in the direction of football as professional as well as at regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimist.
"I believe in this agreement, but the situation is very hard."
"It's not a problem between the Czech and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to change the design regulations."
"This can revoke a blocking to the General Assembly."
"I hope even as well as the good reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is no longer time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should be directly at Montenegro but who can say if all the direction of the football is complete for the match.
The aeroplane in which the Vice-President Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl had not been declined for technical reasons and was searched for a variant to bring a part of the Executive Committee on the area of representatives.
At the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which may have been married, which should be determined.
The Ministry of the Education of Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties in the most strongest sportive association of the country and to bring them to a agreement.
In the game there are many: a statistical dotation, the credibility of football and the General Assembly of the Chec Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of the Chec Sport after the Sazka financial problems.
Paclik is going to fight for the president's position because he doesn't see any right candidate.
If the Leader of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly, which the profile would have responded to all that he would ask for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), it would not be placed in a campaign for this high function.
"If a candidate exists, I support it, I fight for him and I don't present the election."
"But in the present situation it was not possible to find such candidate," said Paclik to the Chec Press Agency (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to enter into competence with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta to access the head of AFRT who would first be favored to this election.
Paclik also underlines that when he would take the elections, he would have the position of the President only until 2013 for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function a experienced and high-level manager but not connected to the football world.
"I have discussed people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with the Chec football at this time."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
The relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of Plzen Roman Berber, a person to the contraverse rename that is known in the collisions as a lobbyist can influence on the vote of the delegated General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta takes the position of the President.
"If he won, the current state would stay and there would be nothing again in the football."
"And with the support of Berber, which is a high-level trader, it would be still less favorable to the football," said Paclik.
This is the fact that the name of Pelta has been announced for several years ago during hearing in the framework of an investigation on a corruption case, for which Pelta has gone out without any pain.
"I don't know what prestigious Pelta would bring to the football."
"And how we would be considered in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA"dit Paclik, who said, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club."
In the case of Paclik triumphed to Judge vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September, who had finished a shipco, think of the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I'm going."
"It's a big capacity."
"It would be possible for example to present himself as the head of the representation."
"But as the manager of the Association would not be capable."
"I don't put the neck in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September had taken a great attention when it was announced to the Commission's annulation of the arbitrary with Lucek Macella, which replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik indicates that he would be at the level to guide the Association.
He takes for example his capacity to lead private firms and also leads from the last year the Plzen club who feed with his support in May last triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the sport world and to bring some culture."
"I would cut out the influence of some interested groups that, for example, have tendency to influence the disciplinary and calling Commission, which brings to bad guest situations," added Paclik, who does not challenge his antipathy for the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonization of relations with the Chec Olympique Committee, which would allow the lobby power to high level policies to obtain more sports of the games.
"It's one of the key points that the new President should take care of."
"If it's a tax on the hazard games like the political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with Plzen club as something of negative even if he himself believes that the President of the AFRT should be "on the parties".
Pelta is reconnected with Jabloec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I don't see why I'm transmitting my actions from Plzen club to someone if I have to return a year and half after," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end up at the path situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Assembly, one of the candidates to the President Miroslav Pelta promised that if it was chosen, the AFRT will have new statutes that should be finished in the future in the fields of the Regulation for elections.
The Jablaec officier is before the judiction meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success of football representation should be quiet before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September which has not been completed has just promised to be sanctified to the national representation and to obtain financial measures if it has been chosen.
He decided to be candidate at the last time just before the past General Assembly, and this late two months would be aware that he would have made it possible to defend his vision of the football direction and to present it in a large context.
"The people at all levels do football for a long time and wait for a president."
"They feel that it is the best time that someone takes the direction of the Association," adds it, but it is first linked to the Jablaec club, worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It is also why he has enough experiences to lead the Chec football.
It is convinced that after the current problems with the election, there is an euphoria governing Ivan Hasek's floor.
"The General Assembly of June has been approved that they were not perfect as they were all considered."
"If there were no distinct interpretations, we would have already had a President since September," says Pelta.
It is just the review of the most important document of the citizen society that took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I am President, I take it as personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities in the case it does not work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," added Pelta.
Then he tried, and we said, "Don't be contrary to his adversaries."
He explained previously that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training rightly and that he continued to know that his advocate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't been attacked for a long time since Tonas Paclik, who doesn't stop criticising Pelta.
"He developed in the football for a year and has already been successful."
"But the attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also why some have doubts about his character now," said Pelta to the address of his adversarie, but remaining, saying, loyal to the proclaims he made in September.
His strongest weapon is according to his knowledge of football from the latter level competitions to the national representation.
That should be a football victory.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with the Bohemians or after the corruption scanne."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for the whole football," said the CTK press Agency, the 46th candidate for two months ago.
He also added that his nomination to the head of the football would not bring any change of persons.
"I should be known with all the employees," he said to Strahov where an understandable nervousness is able to rule since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophical scenarios provided with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not be in Nymburk for nothing.
"If there's only one point of discussion on the way to vote to the third tour, we'll get over it."
"The football needs confidentiality and will only get it when there is a new leader in his head," says he optimist Pelta two days before the day likely determined for his officer carrier.
Rajchl promises that AFRT would start working hardly
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic of the General Assembly, it would not like many people.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the case he would be chosen will begin to work hard.
He wants system changes and make members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to regulate the Bohemian Affairs, to improve relations with the EUFA and the FIFA, to bring to the football more money and continue the work started by the President Ivan Hasek.
"Come President, I want to take a football in his whole."
"On international contacts with the EUFA and the FIFA through national representation, professional football and a football performing for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competents within the Executive Committee so that each member will be busy of a determinated area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions to make the football a big step before."
"More people will not be happy because it's going to start working hardly instead of criticize others" he added.
He did, we said, he would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours per day."
"But I need to know if that's what it is, and if I'll have people behind me, who will put me out without stoping the bottles in the roads, and they will put doubts on every one of my actions," explaining why he's heist.
"A lot of people told me that I don't have to reject because they would also renew."
"This is a confidence I can't train," he said.
The motive, we said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"After these two years, there's been a great job, and I don't want to let him fall."
There are processes that have been launched in several years and I would not like to stop them.' He said, "If in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the middle of the Union is not returned as it was before Hasek.
"I believe a systematic work and it's something that Mireque Pelta doesn't know."
"There he finds people who would make football so that he would be only for those who have been chosen."
"We can approach me a few things but certainly not support anybody."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there's one who says the contrary, I'm ready to make the maximum for the Moravie."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division will be divided in two parts to a cheque and the other morave which the vengedors will be found in the first division."
"There would not have any situation as currently with only three Moraven teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Thomas Paclik, President of Plzen Club, has entered into the competition for the president's position, Rajchl cannot assess its own chances to win.
"I feel permanently a support of the Czech Chamber who chose me his Vice-President and knows that there will be successful with me," said Rajchl, who examines among its future successful efforts to economize decades of millions of coroners on desirable contracts, contracts with TVs and the Law on the games.
He said, in contrast, that the fact that the Association does not be unity is a common sin to all.
While he said about Pelta, "He's disqualizered because the chechical footblal would lose his credibility," he thinks that the second adversary Paclik is a strong candidate who has to offer the football.
"Person can't doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he had been elected, he would certainly continue in what Hasek was started and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to achieve his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his river.
The most beautiful fishing of Europe
A ball in blue
The Julia Stanek
Pataugeories in optical eggs, great fishings of Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after he turned the city or made a long promenade - can leave his feet fatigue in gas water bathrooms.
A book shows what natation basin can be experienced as well as well.
When Iris Meder went to search for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his bags: his bath maillot.
She stretched on her steel in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cooles, and was near to meet Putten marbres who expected him from the other side of the fishing and did not have to admire the New Art Metically restored from these transformated fishings.
If a covered fishing would like him, she noted in her box without a long time all the detailed details of interest on the type of building and the story of the building.
More than 200 piscinas have been sold by the story of Meder Architecture and they have presented them in its book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain). The municipal fishings of Munich, the historical bathrooms in the black forest, "Bedon Hardcore" in Taunus.
She led her "the most exceptional bathrooms in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively place in Italy, France, Tsjechië, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The Germany of 46 years is a real trend of bath culture.
Master, explain that she doesn't have much interest for the sport but he felt at the water in a whole different way.
It is irrigant that the supporters of the natation must be happy to look at blue carriers and bear from the javel water potter, while the joggers reject the perfume sending epicea forests or can listen to the joyful birds of the park.
"I'm asked for a day why fishings must actually be always if they are laid," said the wine.
"I started a beautiful bathroom collection."
The surface of the water is double strengthening the architecture
A plonge in a fishing and oil of volatile sauna - a factor of goodness in the natation salts is great because all the senses are excited by Meder.
And if the buildingrs would be given a little more painful, the near salts could be a real delicate for the eyes: "Instead of a plant, we have a water surface in the native salts."
"It's a transparency side, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically in a double way: high votes, multicolor carriers, tremblins.
The image volume of small format "Badefreuden" makes a valuable report of 190 pages about the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical goodness - it will certainly be able to make a smoke in the blue.
The Collectionary Meder discovered remarkable examples during his research in Hungary.
Besides the well-being bathrooms, such as the Shechenyi bain of 100 years old in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the carst (bain of cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a bath of sterms which the basins are filled with alcal and (Varosi Termalfürdödé in Yasberii) and found in a built-formed building.
In contrast, the piscinas in full air of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a toast of Zürich's bathroom has all the city at its eyes, Arlberg can be admired from a foreign pissy of St. Anton: Turkish bain is muni from a window from which you can observe the animation on the track of sky.
Perhaps the most extraordinary fishing concept waiting for the winners in Langenfeld: The Aqua Dome Otztal seems like a OVNI that comes to argue on Alpes.
In the winter, the vapeur is lifted up from three open plates, while on the ground the mountains of the East to the sky are exalted.
Alhambra in the black forest
Javel's water horror doesn't emerge from all the piscinas of the Meder collection.
A lot of thermical bathrooms exceed a suffering wound, from the Arpad-spa in the Hong Kong Bekesskaba is a strong petrol oil, which is difficult to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The odor provides therapeutic waters containing carbon hydrogen that are almost black and his limons are gathering you to the piece while you leave to the piscina - a special spa experience.
During her looking for beautiful fishings, Iris Meder also went out of deceptions: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outside and full air of the Checoslovaquia, she was found before a barricated landin.
The bain designed by the Duschan Jurkovic Architec in 1902 was closed for a while.
With a slide of eye through the window of the Build Art New in Red-Blanc-Jaune, she observed the scanning of the bad herbs between the carriers.
She observed a contrary effect in a pizza charmant in the Black Forest: The Palace of the Termes of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only of neo-Romeans elements that have gone out from his concept in 1844 but still a bad room in Alhambra style which has been added to him in 1900.
Since its summer modernization of 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bain of the expenses in piscina, Iris Meder - and not only because she is originating from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a beautiful reward as a founder of building styles so different in a so wonderful unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, the spring in the thermal fishing is apparently only a small question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the specification on the first material
of Christian Teevs
Did the German bank leave its specialization on the first materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann loaded a work group to search for the consequences of the specification for the poor of the world.
In January, the boss of the group will then take effects.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the matter is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans is inacceptable that banks spent on the first materials such as the maïs and the ball.
Two thirds of the questioned persons even require that German bank and other credit institutions disappear this business avenue because he increases the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation on the order of Foodwatch consumers' organization.
The study is supported on a report presented by Foodwatch in Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the specialization of the Bourses on the first global materials, puts the prices to high and that banks share a compliance with the world's famine.
The consumer protection campaign is particularly equipped against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are doing the same way.
The specification on the first material was initially introduced to protect the markets against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the opinion that the partners have been detailed from offers and requests - and benefits to the costs of very poor.
Ackermann replied to the criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reviews and said, "No matter is the worst of putting the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to the information of the SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international work group is currently considered the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The exam must be concluded from here the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Administration Council must be presented - with a recommendation of normally.
Last January, the Governor of the Bank will indicate the consequences to shoot.
It could result in a reduction of the market of first materials, or even a full resort.
Ackermann built its image
The Chef of Foodwatch Thilo Bode held the new, but at the same time he confirmed its critical criteria against the financial sector: "The specialization on the price of food feeds shows a particularly draconic way, where the banks of today dry to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all locations of its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food specifications," said Bode.
"It does not matter, Mr. Ackermann, if it's a question of people who are worried or if the Reputation of the Deutsche Bank is in a game."
Ackermann's conscience may appear to the first surprising view, but it is clear that the PDG of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leave his functions.
The Deutsche Bank has announced that the President of the Advisory Council will not change anything to what is provided in the Advisory Council.
Ll could improve its mark image with a revoking the controversed agricultural specifications.
And about eventually losses, he did not guarantee it - his followers will be concerned.
One of the two would resolve placements on the first materials.
Foodwatch tries to keep a strong pressure on the manager.
Before now, more than 30 000 internal people have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
Bode published Mardi's Sunday, with which the Forsa Institute made about 1001 people at 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 per cent have found that the Deutsche Bank proposes placements for which paids on the prices of food products are made.
Many of the bank clients would also take personal consequences if they learn that their bank participates in such operations: one over two would, after the supply, all the placements for which the money is injected in the primary specializations.
43 per cent would declare such banks around them, 49 per cent of them replied that they would consider their account to change banking institutions.
21th house in Vienna
The Pavillon who carried out
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with high, low and a Happy End: the Australian pavillon for the world exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
Now he is open again and holds a place of exposition.
If it is emphasised for a modern architecture, for its clear forms, his hongers in seeing, his live and audacieous tents and its new building materials that are typically of the creation in the technical progress, then the pavillon of the Australian architecture Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and nice example.
The Pavillon of Schwanzer first received the "Grand Price of Architecture" for its build in acid and glass, easy and suspended.
The construction is considered to be a significant step in the contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so glorious, that he also built Pavillon for the next Universal Exposition.
With his legendary house to four BMW cilindros and its adjacent build in Munich, he finally became celebrated at the international level in 1973.
The project of a pavillon as a temporary construction was exposed after the universal exhibition in the Jardin Switzerland to the South Garden of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not physically nor technically adapted for a museum - no walls to increase art works, so not a good environment.
However, it was so long used, until the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was more deep.
At this time, the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavillon, now he takes the name of "Maison of the 21th century" and will be used in the future as museum for the contemporary art.
Tonight, Belvedère's museum opened, where the house is, the first exposition - a couple of chances at all points of view.
The new department was carried out by Agnès Huslein-Arco, which became the new guideline in 2007 of the Australian Gallery Belvedère.
Huslein-Arco, has promoted an artist historic to a significant carrier among others in his youngest artistic patients, afterwards in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as a fundamental director of the modern art of Salzburg's museum, she has carried out specially the works of transformation with the political men and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and private sponsoring and established the exploitation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the Sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name has been exposed there, a coffee and a library is found, and a office must be built there.
strict monitoring, small budget
So for the realization of Krischanitz was the ideal interpret.
Not only because he had transformated and expanded Joseph Olbracht's session and he had won the concours, but because he had studied in the Vienna Technical University and that the pavillon for him was a "extremely important place" where he saw "practially every weekend" expositions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the issues of the building, which lost in generousness and legality after his movement to Vienna and the change of use.
In the current transformations, there were great problems: the building was "un energy gouffe," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of glass were changed, the isolant glass strengthened in glass fibres were placed and the tooth replaced by a particular security green.
The thermical pools have been strengthened or replaced, and the full clothes of friends have been rehabilitated.
Two sub-sols have made the place to the new exploitation, a light panel that is likely between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a pool leads to the entrance - it's almost a new building, but always the lighter Pavillon Schwanzer.
The outside doors of origin are remained, the house is penetrated in a protective dark against the red-brun role.
And the cinema room is even exactly similar to what she was previously.
And all this is under extreme monitoring of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Speak of materials that are good and little love should be found, and they also enjoy the office of monuments protection," says Krischanitz, and he attracts the attention on a soft soil.
Although all contrasts, problems and transformations, the editing remains soft and lighter.
This would be difficult with the Pavillon, "who proved from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
A such architecture is "all the evil place" and doesn't even want to "avoid the good conscience."
But in this case, the Home of the 21th century is not in a bad place, because if it is a chance of urban building: around the Swiss Jardin is just the "quarter of the central gate" all newly proposed, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: The Home of the 21th century could benefit from the strength of another Building Krischanitz, because Francesca van Habsburg has buyed the Berlinois temporary art centre, and as he said, it already negotiates with the city to get a site in the nearby Jardin Switzerland.
Bahn plans a forfait crisis of hiver in millions.
The ferry routes society has developed a crisis plan, which means to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of salaries should double.
This costs of millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to hiver saison and late, the company of ferry "Deutsche Bahn" will expansion this year more than 70 million additional.
The day "Image"-Zeitung reported to the prevalence by invited a internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of $300 million would be provided until 2015.
This should also make a better accessibility of vehicles and vehicle networks in the case of extreme time.
The number of internal and external salaries for the denection of ferroviary installations and which should double between others and pass to 16,000 persons.
The objective is to discard those from snow and glass until the start of the service phase and 90% of the route devices required for the service for a period of four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Guarantee of Rüdiger Grube has maintained the government and industry during a conference to the total of train accidents also occurred in this hiver.
The last hiver of the farway society has been a great problem for user transport because it is missing between other reserves in cases of difficult meteorological conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains wait for a authorisation from the Ministry of Forest Roads for years.
Furthermore, there's a late time in the ICE trains delivery.
The ferry route company has been since years of what to do, since it has to be carried out the ICE trends most often more often at the athlete, after a exploitation of the ECE in the Central Garden of Cologne has been placed on an ECE.
The German Bank "Deutsche Bank" pays million penalties in the United States.
After the case of the chief Joseph Ackermann, there is new in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay an amendment for millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not yet sufficient, the past of this sector's rate trap in more in the United States: Francfort's institution pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to make a difference due to the failure of five large co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothec documents.
The NCNUA Financial Market Regulator provides large banks a series of accusations, and it is to ensure co-operative banks to make false promises on financial products; they would minimize risks.
These documents have perished greatly during the financial crisis and have introduced banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied, that we could find a solution on this matter, without the parties completely a procedure to the court," said a Deutsche Bank interpreter in New York.
The Bank has not recognised in comparison with no error.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has contributed to a payment of $20,5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz adopted the conceits of the two bank institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for co-operative banks in the United States and is in case of failure to protect customer deposits.
The NCNUA tries to repair the sufferings of several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their kind.
The regulatory also took other large banks in part and was assigned before the JP Morgan Chase Court, the King Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The question of hypothec documents is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are based on.
When the U.S. Immobilier built in 2007, this was fatal for a lot of bank companys.
In September 2008, under the financial crisis, the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers was broken.
Even if the events have already been given for a few years, the current time he suffers a temperature wind on American banks.
Investors and monitoring authorities have tried many reviews to get reparation or to sanctify missing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) declared the largest statement.
She approximates to 18 large international banks, to two financial financials of the United States Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of being pregnant in nature in cases of hypothesis about about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also needs to take a review to the FHFA, which is here from several operations of a total amount of 14,2 billion dollars for the 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter answers "substantial pertes" but without citing a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank refused the requests as unjusted and declared to defense.
WARREN Buffett increases 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the guarantee of financing, invested colossal asses in IBM TI business.
Since March, he buyed actions for a value of more than 10 billion dollars.
Although the major American investors Warren Buffett explains without stop investing in TI computer companys, since the long-term evolution of society is not only a bad prognoses.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed its opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already understood that IBM proposed services and information systems for TI sectors of other enterprises.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered as a chair attack in the financial world.
The TI IBM activities therefore offers the right to call "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett today discovered the CNBC economic emission, which has buyed from March of IBM actions a value of $10.7 billion.
His company holding investment Berkshire Hathaway has become a large IBM actionner with a part of 5,5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM never knew this commitment until here.
He welcomed the direction, which even during the economic crisis had assessed reasonable benefits.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett strategicly.
IBM was set a few times on TI winning services as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, older than 100 years old, offers software and consultation as well as very performing business calculators.
Buffett was at least disappeared by the technology businesses.
He says that he only invests in businesses that he includes businesses.
But, in contrast, Buffett is attacked at the farmer frequency, manufacturers or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 companys and parts in a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the ex municipal back.
This 81-year-old 81-year-old has been reached in the 60s" the small textile Berkshire Hathaway and has raised it at the range of one of the most prestigious world enterprises, through intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why it's a figure of worship for many investors of the world.
He's almost unfair to win the money he valued the name of "Omaha Oracle".
After the advertising of Buffett investment, IBM actions have increased a percentage to the bourse.
"Big Blue", as well as IBM, has a total value of more than 220 billion dollars and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious technologies in the world.
In Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
Menation is palpable
After discovering the "Zwickauer's cell", Turkish media described by the German law state.
A journal even talks about a "blood idea" that would renew now.
The killers of eight Turkish residents and a small Greek company in the 2000-2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and Turkish population react with fear and concern.
Because for many Turkish Germans the spektrum that it had been dead for a long time revealed his appearance: from the incendial attentions of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there is no more like violence with this extremist context of right against Turkish.
In Germany, a xenophobia, it has never been questioned.
The extremist right network, which has been detected, however, of the proportions which the dimension is far away from being previsible.
"It's a return to the bloody ideology," "It was the title of the interview of the Turkish day "Haberturk".
The magazine "Saba" underlines that one of the authors would be a V-man of the Constitution Protection, and is concerned that German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bourbon.
It is reasonable that Turkish community reacted in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent reminder to the victims of racial violence before the door of Brandeburg.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community of Berlin and German and Turkish policies had considered a ceremonie of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkey recruitment agreement.
It's with gas colors that the coabitation had been set in scene, symbolizing a successful story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gifle: "The gift of Germany for the fifth anniversary" so is the title of a article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German parution of "Hurrity" is not privileged to take a single condition.
"cause starts at a kid," this is the title of the chronic of Ahmet Külahci.
It is underlined that people would be killed, paid imposes and would have contributed to the rebuilding of Germany.
The police action has been considered very critically on German Turkish Forums, and these were discussed afterwards of the success of their research.
Why no longer has come to the spirit of German authorities to make research in some suspects of the right extreme environments, they are surprised by the authors.
More than one is shown at least to drastical rhetoric means: "If the case continues to be built, it will not remain to migrants but autodefence and army."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and pertinence of the total network punishment," wrote "Selen".
What that means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, Mölln and Solingen in the 90s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply raised in the German and Turkish memory.
Because there was no other event clearly shown to Turkish who lived here but there was a tangible threat, and Germany, in which disagreement and disagreement could be moved by violence.
However, the attentions have increased the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the past errors
In addition, it is especially the loss of German policy after the attention of the Turkish press has been clear: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Soling's fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, he made the funerals in Cologne by his minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted the time in his talk, how many taxs produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its fiscal charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows how much more the disagreement of many Germany is deeply against the local law state since that date.
Furthermore, the efforts of a more widely clarified and review of the extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
Zürich Lake Scandale Bank
The most aventured European Bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost fallen in the financial and patent crisis between times of a crisis to another.
It's a German who must lead now.
This isn't sure what Axel Weber was imagined.
After his spectacular department of the head of the Buddhisbank, it was known in July, that he had been occupied in 2013 as well as spectacular position: President of the Council of Administration of the Large Switzerland Bank - a great step to a unexpected and lucrative carrier.
Axel Weber was published, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and made a favorable comment on the future colleagues.
"UBS has succeeded Turnaround."
"I'm glad of cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But since September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
An UBS tickets in London had turned out all bank security systems and had a flambe about 1,7 billion euros.
The Board of Administration Council of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well known banker, not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Administration Council of the UBS is considered as suffering - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber may be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will renew the President of Administration in May - not in 2013, as it has communicated to the March Bank.
For Axel Weber, that's gonna be hard.
He is not banking, much more teacher of economic and President of the Bank, and it would certainly have needed a period of adoption.
On one point, then, he assumes the responsibility for a bank strategy, which has come to prove again more than she has a longer degree of the title of "the largest bank in Europe's scanne".
In fact, the UBS is from a large side - until recently, she was the biggest manager of the world's active manager, and the other, she suffers since years of a scanne to the other.
Nothing, he seems, doesn't disappear the so honourable Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Before 2007, the UBS had a great reputation.
The picture of the Swiss manager of activists, silent and solid, but also rushed, she was combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to be in the bank investment area, a very large bank.
So the UBS would lead one side in 2007 with $1,6 billion more of money from a customer employed than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had progressed as an investment bank in the world's largest banks.
That's what it's done.
The old banker Hans Geiger and later a bank teacher for years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"In the current optic, we're asked: How could I just get me to this point?"
He was depthed.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn around the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli was amazingly departed, which was considered as a high intellectual and a great bank.
A few months later, we were pressing for what reasons he was gone.
The bank division was flambed with sub-private documents and had a cross on billion.
In order to exhaust this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross over.
That is why she really found investors, but who, a few years ago, would have frozen the summers: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapur and a Arab State fund, which has passed in silence, in the point that it has never learned his name.
It wasn't just the first time.
In April 2008, this was empirical.
The bank should again announce the billion losses, the President of the Administration Council Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second administration advice of the best payment of Switzerland.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: the UBS had been, taking into account its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the failure and should be saved by the State.
The national bank has recognised the UBS of decades of billion of problems, and the Switzerland Confederation has given six billion francs for transformable obligations to action, for which it could become co-profit to the bank.
All Swedish has been sealed - because she noted how much this could be dramatic for a small country, to abbreviate so large banks.
Finally, the entire budget of the UBS 2007 has increased more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said the bank investigator, Geiger.
After the first catastrophe, he followed the second.
During a few months ago, the UBS had been captured because of a financial differences with America, and it was made ready to publish the data of the customer, which may have broken the fishery with the Bank's help.
Furthermore, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in reward of unjustified benefits from these operations with an increased amendment.
So the UBS has published more or less than she had helped the fiscal fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scanning, the Switzerland bank secret has not been the same.
He followed the retail of the Board of Administration and President of the Advisory Council.
And the exode of customers' money.
So the bank had lost his credibility in the two major business sectors in several months: bank investment because of bad specifications and the management of activity because of a fiscal fraud.
And, as there was a little back to the calm, and as we thought, the UBS would go out, he followed this funny story of title markets: a only flambe title market 1,7 billion euros, before the bank appeared that something did not turn around.
And it is published: with the management of risks in investment banks, it seems not always work.
"Besides the case of Adoboli, we have been able to realize that the maintenance of risks are too little changed," says Martin Janssen, economic and professor of financial funds in the Zürich University.
So the Financial Director of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it has no risk management in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of understanding, with which the Swiss banks had taken their function since long, it became aware of the greatest world: not too big risks, but the security for money - and the world could well be able to flow beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss bank reserves were the symbol of an inevitable faithfulness such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich is still paid with the solid click of the Switzerland private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classical.
The Bank has its seat at the central guarantee of Zurich, which directly leads from the central guard to Zurich lake, who himself is turned by the smooths of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are here prestigious, the ships of ships are among the most highest Europe.
Beautyers such as Tiffany's, we find them here between the Switzerland traditional magazines as well as those of the confidence Sprüngli.
Since centuries of Switzerland banks have resided here: from the national bank passed through the Palace of the Switzerland to elected private banks such as Julius Bär.
We're coming into the UBS's entrance hall by a big door.
Inside, the walls are clothed by marble, before they find wood rooms, and near the logo of the bank, a big label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client searchs here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has a day or the other disappearance of the market - or carried out the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, such as the chief of a small private bank is found.
He would prefer not to read his name in the journal, finally as all the Switzerland banks, he also made business with the two large banks.
The UBS would become too large, especially in the bank investment, where Anglo-saxons would be broken.
The Switzerland wouldn't have any more to say.
"And even though, they have been adapted to Anglo-saxons masters for a long time."
This was actually the Anglo-saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, which has made high benefits and then the debt: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-private jungle as the large Switzerland bank.
The catastrophe appeared on 15 October 2008.
"This mercred the Government Coalition of the small country to seven million d'habitants have undertaken the greatest saving operation in the history of their nation," writes Lukas Hessig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With 68 billion francs around, or 45 billion euros, the political men accepted to save the big bank from failure.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Switzerland banks, they see the problem especially on the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Switzerland banks concluded a great group together.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the Sweden - and has recorded a growth without stop.
What has helped is that the two various UBS banks have completed: a rich bank, but in lethhargy, with a stronger strength, the management of the actives in Zurich and the poorer, but sometimes more internationalized.
At the same time, international investment banks had favorable access to many money, with which they could turn a great round.
Two names are associated with the UBS accession: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, President of the Administration Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank investigator, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intelligence, which hears very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intelligence, who has broken a way to the top of the bank learning."
But Ospel would be faithful until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive error at the end: "He thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic shot."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exemption has arrived before the fucking.
The UBS personnel is clearly remembering the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word of order: distract Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" classs that documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already successed him.
In the case of devises and transactions of mobile values, she played a very important role.
However, undertaking advisers, which had responsibility, have submitted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a great differences in relation to the largest banks.
The UBS would have lacunes at the level of American hypothesis products.
To fill this lake, the UBS was launched in an aventure, which almost costed his life.
Associates of growth, it is also the bank itself that a management fund created before it in the American sub-private placements that have invested.
She was transformed into a massive machine that has built and caused the value documents based on the American hypothecares - but also has stored risks.
Even when other banks looked for a long time to get down.
"Again in the year 2007, while the American immobilier market was in flammes, the UBS buyed here," said Geiger, the bank expert.
More the euphoria is greater the smoke is brutal.
A manager after the other had to go, when the trials had been more difficult than we thought.
UBS positions have become explosive and are until now banks.
He who leads the big bank has almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, for which all proposed business models have lost.
The bank researcher, Geiger has already a idea: put a term to the investment bank, concentration to the management of goods, return to the Switzerland rains.
But the bank doesn't want to go too far.
But the investment bank must be courageously attrophy, as it is clear until now.
Jeudis next to Sergio Ermotti banker wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The Italian Suisse of 51 years was only supposed to be a transitionary title when the bank was separated with surprise of his Grübel pre-presentative.
At least, he was imposed: it must be aware of the UBS affairs, he has communicated the Zurich Bank married.
Hermotti wants to bring the investment bank to the average of 1990.
The year is 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What do she wants to win money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already been issued.
He said publicly until now only that he was going to look for a apartment in Zurich with his wife.
The next year.

Intelligent corners propagate in cities
In many places, frequencies are considered as "the problem of birds of birds" but experts claim that these very intelligent animals are no longer lost from the cities.
Some of them love, some others want to depart from them as fast as possible. The corners are in the city for centuries, but in many communities the plains of residents are multiple because of health and the grass of animals.
An antidote against the " egg problem " is not yet invisible.
In the first ostfriesc symposium on the corns, experts said that it is not possible to escape the fresh towns.
The experts of all Germany have explained the possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Natural protectioners also based the problems of the cities on the exode of particularly protected frequency: the use of chemical products in agriculture destroys more and more traditional live spaces.
The chase, the emergency and the packing of typical cowling trees made a difficult life to birds.
The corners are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonys with more than 600 cooking couples in the West-Falish Soast, in the north-west of Jever, Diepoolz and Aquim near Bremen and Leer.
In 2005, a controversy project had wined negative publicities because of the massacre of corns in this region.
Criticals found the capture of birds in pieces and kill them with particularly brutal gurdins.
"The normal expulsion, the event, doesn't serve anything," stated the planner of the city and Leer's landing, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nids using water under pressure or well attacking the trees, often produces indesiderable consequences, said Manfred Kaiser of Lahr at Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are far away, the great colony are divided and they split into other places."
"Avasion is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retreat houses or schools.
"We find obligations to live with them, we can't disappear them."
The problem is not allowed to resolve in the cities without the inclusion of the device, according to the opinion of Master Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the emergency of animals to an adverse condition and acrocated offers to allow them to reinstall otherwise.
Psychology and ethnology, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "Information panels in the place of thrones" to establish completely different relations with them: "We can finally support a button on the face with a dose of confidence in itself."
Jürgens co-funded the Ascheberger-Educative-Educative-Educative-Education-Education of the corees in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels reporting on the life of these very intelligent frequencies.
This project has been adopted during the time by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism about the sound caused by the birds: "You want a lot of communication, these birds have much to say."
The intelligence and capacity of animals are legitimate: the frequency use not only work tools to get a regular, but they make their tools as work tools.
Cambridge University's ethologists tested four recently fresh, at which point the understanding of birds comes.
In a experience, the birds learned quickly that they had to explore a scale with stones to come to a wide.
Without a lot of training, they were determined that a stone should have some biggest and form to pull the platform.
In a second test, the astucieous corners had to then resolve a better problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small side with a wide.
The birds couldn't get their boat with their beef.
However, the researchers had set a piece of feed in their provision.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help that they fished the small steel of the little killer.
Three of the four frequency were successful even since the beginning.

The new book of Peter England offers deep and generousness. Intitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Chagrin: an intime story of the First World War), it starts by a long list of persons that serve the heart.
An advice to start: Describe this page carefully and make it your mark page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this romantic record of Peter Inglund, this list of persons will be your GPS, a tag in those few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be hungry and disappointed in the weapons of war.
Peter England is a Swedish history and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Sweden Academy, which delivers the Nobel Price of literature.
He wrote here a book out of the common that he described, with exactly, as "the work of an anti-historian."
It holds some known names, important treatments or holiday battles; there is nearly no ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials.
It's not so a book about what happened, he explains, just a "book described in what it could seem." We find the "emotions, impressions, experiences and humors."
"The beauty and the chagrin" summarizes the experiences in the war of 20 men and women more or less or less normal, both sides of war, young schools and botanists to scale, through doctors, ambulants and soldiers.
Some will be heroes.
Others of war prisoners, some will lose members, become foolish or lose life.
Their lives are vacillated here as the circles of a church: while some are amazing, they are in the light of news.
The book of Peter England is out of traditional history books.
It brings a decree to the idea that the First World War is considered only by the terrible war of tracks on the west side.
"The beauty and the chagrin" describes well other war teaters: Alpes, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and Eastern Africa.
The soldiers presented in this book are under rues; a Noël Pass in Egypt under the pyramides; the tseth moons are an interiable problem.
This book is moved from the first page.
The war has invaded the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, such as a ouragan Katrina, who puts the cordite.
When canon shoes stay away, and you're a mother in the family, stay or run?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Inglund, "the missing of facts has been issued by suggestions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspirationist theory, dreams, dreams and rumors."
"The beauty and the chagrin" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food within the Russian Army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young marine of the high-marine float of Germany.
Their story are mainly shooted from memory, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives may be terrified or passionant, but they are maintained by the accumulation of small isolated moments and details.
Most of them approach the privacy and the ability to go out.
While the story of a German school, Peter England wrote: "Elipse, partout replacement."
"Replacement Café, false aluminium, caoutchouc imitation, paper bands, wood buttons."
He continued on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "cooked fish made in the bottom grass (and ends with a false tree bone); the tabac made with seed rows and the smoke of ground pooms; wooden seeds."
It indicates that "837 replacement meat are recorded in the production of sauces. It also finds 511 coffees of substitution."
Some story approach honor and strength.
One American recognizes his own pulsion against the sauvery and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, the men were destined, instead of sitting in a comfortable weakness, a cigarette and a whisky on the hand, reading a journal or a best-seller, and instead of imagining that such virus is a civilization synonyme, and that there is no barbar behind your chemistry endorsed and closed.
Inverse, a British soldier realizes that he's risking to die, and that nobody will not notice it or take care of it.
"Which we are resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public."
It's unfortunately most comparable to "A stranger in secret."
Other comments relate to the decline of an older Europe and new types of fear.
"The conflict becomes more economic competition story," wrote Peter Anglund, "a war between the uses."
He took the achievement of what he called "new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated mass and ideally convinced, in well-tailed clothes, which executes his mouth all while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; they find a lot of basic behavior as a heroism.
Peter England speaks of soldiers who tried to take a vinear disease in prostitute to escape the service to the front.
"We find the biggest expression in the market of puss to gomorrhee, which soldiers acquire and stand on genetic bodies in hope to end in the hospital," wrote he.
"The most unexpected are applied to the eyes, which is translated by a life-leading cecite."
In this translation of Sweden by Peter Graves, Peter Anglund's proceeding is low but not observatory, perfectly adapted to his humanity's task.
In the decades of scenes, he adopted the way the war has "declined exclusively uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion for religion."
People begin to ask why their leaders make a war.
The best works treated from the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and the modern Memory) of Paul Fussel, or "On West Nothing" of Erich Mary Remark, instead of full.
Peter England's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most accurate thing I read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal her.
But it's like if he had risen from his book, put this page out of your hands, where the list of persons found and burned with a flash.
After a first failure, a minute planned operation
Third hundreds of police officers have been implied, some carried out anti-emitato boxes.
The lunch evening was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation remains secret of all hormies of some high officers and other information from the beginning they were going to go to an earlier.
The Commissioner of Raymond W. Kelly was in the heart of the operation, his presence underlined risks and deficits for the police department.
It could not have repeated "episodes" in the past weeks, such as the use of gas pains against demonstrators, which have gone against the Department Regulation and have built a public solidarity temper for the manifestants.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park of his manifestants was developed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared to observe the deployment of occupation in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island in order to operate in Zuccotti park.
Police officers receive a better training against emergency - anti-terroristic measures that consist fast to move a large number of police - to concentrate on the room of Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday, on the side of Manhattan of East River.
The orders given to be moved into the park have been " at last minute " stated a habitual reference to the operation as " a simple exercise " .
"The few police who I know and who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti park," said the person under anonymous.
"The only ones to know that they would get there are the helicopter of the police department."
The city has been able to keep a lesson, from where the secret of the operation is.
On 14 October last, the police wanted to clean up the park but were made to repeat hundreds of detailed demonstrators.
The March Operation included officers of various police units, including operational forces of all quarter - decades of officers used in particular criminal quarters.
Mr. Kelly stated that many people went and came to the park for the day, in the way of migrants. So a morning's hour was a proper time.
"It was agreed to proceed when the park counted at least of people," he said.
Automobiles of equipped shops and high-speakers were gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's pool, before interviewing.
The lights and messages recorded by high-speakers seemed to intimidate the manifestors.
While the officers of the Community business penetrate in the equipped park of their light blue, many demonstrators have just collected their business and departed.
No tension has been touched before 145, the police has said that the time has left the employees to gather their business.
Other police teams were shown on the period, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chair of the police department, stated that this measure was only taken by security.
But after a number of journalists, the police would have stopped them to observe the intervention within the park, which was rudely held by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television cameras on Church Street, on the east side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the west through the foul stage of affairs, including bags, plastic gas and gass full of clothes, teams of the department of the exploitation followed, cleaning all that the employees left behind them.
Some manifestants who refused to leave were trained. Images were broken on the Internet a little later.
The main group of manifestants took place near the campaign cook, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police has moved to stop methodically.
A decade of persons in the campaign spectrum were joined together.
Finally, two persons have been married to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
The urgency services were called to cut the strings.
There was no arrest in the park before 3h30 Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation has been completed about one hour and four later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
the majority for "the public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, is the office of the most grade to be found on the sites.
Phil T. Pulaski, the captain of the Detective Department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "I didn't lead the operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police patients patiently from the side is the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were located on Cortland Street, a park of houses in the north of the park, and on Pine Street, south.
We have seen the Police to expand the perimeter close to the Zuccotti park.
Many officers, most equipped bottles, would even have been seen in training people to leave them away.
Before 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most alive actions of the night had been at the south of the park.
In 5 hours, at the south of Pine Street, a manifestant saved on the head of a police car. Others were shown in training the pneus of a police car.
At a moment, an anti-playing smoke has risen by flying the people.
Finally, a police and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The syndicate of school support continues the city for licences
The syndicate represents hundreds of schools who have lost their work last month is to ensure a process to the city for unuse and discrimination licensing. The impact is disproported on schools which are achieved by disfavorized schools.
The continues are probably the last arm of the syndicat, Council of 37th District, to try to cancell the licences.
Six hundred and twenty school supporters, parents coordinators and other employees, as part of the less well paid in the city, lost their job on 7 October last. Syndical leaders have compared these licences to a political vengeance to not allow the city to access a fund for health care guided by workers' groups, and who would have allowed to close the budget excuse at the last time.
The municipal authorities have noticed this accusation.
During a audience of the Municipal Council last month, the chancelier Dennis Walcott stated that the licences were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied that the licences of school support were not specific in the budget.
The officers of the Council of 37th District have stated that they would fulfil the opinion of reclamation, warning the department of the education that it would continue; a press conference will be organised in mercredial conference to publish officially the judicial procedures to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Walcott and the Education Department of the City will be the defense part of the defense. The passengers will be represented by eight licensed workers, all black or Latin-American origin, such as most school supports that have lost their employment.
Elizabeth Thomas, port-word of the town legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons of the process and therefore can not make comments on allgements.
Following a disappearance of discourages received by New York Times, the syndicat would put on the number of licences in the schools of the most disappointed cities to support its statement against an inequitable treatment, explaining that the poor schools will lose the most aid because of a regular subfinancing.
While there is no licence on State Island, and some of them in the stations of Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school supports have lost their employment in the 23th Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8e and 9e southern quarters of Bronx.
Having noted the loss of five schools on eight schools employed in the public school 36 of Harlem, where 68% of schools live in poverty, the continued stated that "It's not a employed parent quarter who can bring funds to fill the budget missing."
The public school budget 36 was reduced from 3,26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city has changed its additional financing calculation for each highly devoted inscription.
The syndicat also indicates that school guidelines could be incorrect by certain terms in a note that allows the licence of parents' coordinators.
The note used the term "passage" to describe the action, although more "passage" describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose payments are paid by the Central Office.
According to the project of claims, "60 parent coordinators have been licensed" and "not only because of disappearance."
Mission completed: The Congress finds a agreement on the issue of Libya
It seems finally that the Republicans and the Democrates had found a agreement to the Capitol on the issue of subsequence in Lybia.
It will fail a successful survey, capture and death of the Long Date Dictor Muammar Kadhafi and the American implication.
The Committee of Foreign Relations of the Senat should take a next March decision, supported by President John Kerry (Democrate - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), approving the Liberal people for their revolution and American groups for their "court".
"This resolution is to honor the strength of the Liberians while they start to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be inoffensive, but the debate on Libya has never been easy until now.
This was, two parties' legislators have been in conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the OTAN mission in Libye.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited employment of American military forces in Libye.
The Law project has been punished by a large bipartisan margin and has never made a vote in Senat.
However, at the same day of unfailure of the Law project, the Deputy Chamber also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of American operations in Liberia.
The America's mission is therefore remained under a form of legislation purgatory - the Congress is sufficiently contrary to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the herb under the feet.
The indecision of the Congress has been exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under August insurgents and Kadhafi was killed last 20 October.
The OTAN mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senat can act now.
The resolution of the Committee of Foreign Relations "Felix the people free for their strength and its extraordinary definition for freedom" and "Felix the men and women of American army forces and their partners of coalition in military operations to protect the Liberian people, for their power and fantastic professionalism."
The resolution also indicates "the national interest in the United States to come to an irreversible and successful transition to the Democracy in Libye."
Will the new measure take all the support of the Commission of Foreign Affairs of the Senate or divide legislators as last June?
The Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Logar (Independent) had been opposed to the last version.
His door-word stated that Richard D. Logar had not yet read the last version of the new project.
In the Capitol, the Chamber must vote this week a amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrates.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other question, to get a vote to the room or Senat.
Other legislators have not succeeded to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of 68 constitutional amendments to be presented in the Congress on a wide event of subjects.
Some are repeated - the same law project proposed once at the room and the Senate - and others are less variations of the previous.
At least 15 versions in the Chamber are considered only the amendment for a balanced budget, and another poign that " would control the federal expenditures " .
Some of these law projects are identical, but they give their support - in particular the new Republicans who want to give their CV - the chance of being the author of such measures.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved in August the vote of the Chamber and of the Senat on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted for an unrelated resolution supporting the idea of such amendments.
In addition to the budget, many members want to limit the number of mandates during which the members of the Congress may serve, while Joseph E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to exalte the limit of two mandates for Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
A amendment prohibiting the marriage between individuals of the same sex is forever proposed, as the amendment prohibiting the violation of the drug.
Some legislators also want to ensure the interruption of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed.
As soon as they were members of offering amendments, they are not so fast as far as the past.
At 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110th.
The fall of the beginning of 1990, when the members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senat Library.
But these amendments had no longer success than they had today.
The last amendment to be added - 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not batted" says Gabrielle Giords when his first television from the fusilation
Ten months after a armed man shoot him up to Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Gibords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on the evening in a television emission, singing "The Sun Will come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said that he wanted to return to the Congress.
After his apparent to the TV journal "20/20" on the ABC chain, on the side of Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Dirords stopped to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The "Emission" turned his hard return after the ball that fractured his crown and perceived the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she had made an extraordinary return to the room of representatives to vote the text on the debt level.
After his first television television from the January fusilation, who killed six people and hurt thirty others, Gabrielle Giords dreamed, ridiculous and singing - and qualified her rehabilitation of "difficial".
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Gibords, 41 years old, replied, "Plutt well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giords and his husband, Mark Kelly's astronaut, has been located in a special edit of a "20/20," distracted the vision of the new book of the couple titled "Gabby: a story of strength and hope".
The special emission retracted Gabrielle Dirords from the fusilation of January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, we looked on his hospital bed, the rased head and a large cicatrice on the front.
She's only using one or two dogs, with the encouragements of her husband.
A couple of months later, Gabrielle Giords is sitting in a rounding room while the doctors learn to execute simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Dirords spoke another word ("Toast") to ask you to change the menu of his little dinner.
Videos discovered by ABC show the important role of music in the restauration of Gabrielle Georgs: is the Representative in the train of singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "My Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
At the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Dirords, who passed two hours each day with the doctors, he said not to remember the fusilation.
According to his husband, he was intended to read him a article on the flight of March 12 when she stopped it and asked for the first time information about the six killed persons in the accident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was arrested in a prison of Missouri and was courageously treated by waiting for the process.
"There's a lot of dead" said Gabrielle Guiords in Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, stop, stop."
In her restauration, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I'm battled."
"I'd say," Gabby, you didn't have been battled," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and return more stronger than ever.
More pitied than respect for groups
Event: a Wall Street galle to collect millions of dollars for veterans without rent from the city of New York.
Kid Rock singed a balled on impression, frustration and loss.
hundreds of soldiers, mariners, pilots and mariners around him.
The people in costume-cravate stood at his feet to claim it.
"The soldiers, men and women are considered as heroes," said David Saltzman, an organizator of the fund collection of the presemps.
A high-grade military range present in the gala, which also participated with the friend Mike Mullen, the major staff of the army of the United States, has seen the role of the groups differently.
"They were presented as a kind of orphelin," wrote the military high-grade in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizators had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just mercy.
Absolute contradictive impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been installed between military and a passioned American public but often far.
Honourments are forbidden to the bodies for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, telling some military.
The public acts more as if he was sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all of the victims," said the general officer Sean B. MacFarland, who led the groups in Iraq and will soon go for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way of supporting us would be to shut us in the role of false spirits."
It is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, which do not want to be unrecital or disappointed with the public that they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of revengeing groups of Vietnam war was very worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on peace have been confidentiality among veterans.
After returning his two sons of battle with the Marines, Mark Cancian retreated council warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to a lot of constraints.
Others would ask whether "a veteran in wrath and violence be hidden under the surface " said Cancian, who was struck in Iraq and returned to work in Washington government.
When he was looking for an employment, he said, he felt that some people who had passed his treatment were subtitlely asked if it could have been able to take the job under the street of an employment required to Washington immediately after his return to the battle.
"If you are at the subject of the service, you are compared to negative impressions," remembers Colonel Cancian when he talks to his son.
Army's difficulties, in particular, exceed America's infringement against wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a country so little family with the army, which sees a few direct advancements of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"In as a nation, we will not assess the heroism of the same way as for the Second World War" states the general leader of David Barno, who led the groups in Afghanistan.
Instead, the welcome of political men and the people focused widely on the depth of a military sufferings.
The groups are recognised for the number of loaded services periods, the number of lost friends or the expansion of wounds.
Army faces the growing pressure of sevir against violence
This week, a capital audience will decide if 28 men and women will go in case against the army for a suspected inaction on violence.
In the case, hundreds of trainers will prepare the next.
The soldier of the first class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and age of 11 weeks in the night when she said she was violated by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her chair to Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after she was dinner with a friend, when she met a college that carried a beer package.
He asked him if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane had me worried about her.
I thought he was 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should follow my intuition."
A few minutes after he was entered into the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man took him behind, thrown through the ground and violated, prevented it.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and other none, will expect the decision of justice in an historical process that will be deployed in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a procedure is brought against the old secretary defense Robert Gates and his presidence, Donald Rumsfeld, will be located.
The last ones are accused not to stop generalization of violence within the army, taking into account the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, the process implied to department 17 plagued. This number was higher than 28 months in the following - 25 women and 3 men, who wanted to have been violated or sexually abused by soldiers. They also suggest that the army has not been investigated, followed or offered justice after the attacks.
Susan Burke declares to take them to the gallonian soldiers, because the problem begins by them.
"The Army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in the position of evacuation of the represailles culture?
The lawyer also states that since February, it has been contacted about about 400 other survivors, which most could be part of future judges.
His strategy: instead of gathering all distressers in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same panier - she will try many processes, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defence team, for the Defence Department, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has set a movement to refuse the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be continued by soldiers in service or not for wounds in armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, named the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for violations under the active personnel.
"The evil involved is inherent to the military service of distressers " indicating the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to make all comments.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women have not yet, officially, the right to go to the fight, this distinction is not only written on the paper: the lines before recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women soldiers teams play a more important role, especially to contact local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 soldiers have lost life - two thirds in battle situation.
It's time for the army to modernize Susan Burke.
She is not only to take this fight: three other processes are running in more of her.
In Yale's law school, the Veterans' legal services centre prepares a case against the four major military academies to encourage a mixed ambition.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation of Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a process against the Army, focusing on the diagnosis of "trueble personality " dedicated to the victims of violence to give them congest - a relatively regular fact, according to the activities such as Annu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network (the military women ' s action network), a group for human rights.
His group tried a procedure in December to the Administration of Veterans, accusing discriminatory practices in order to treat warning requests for persons declaring to have been victims of sexual agression in the service.
Nine independent law projects were presented to the Congress by a bipartisan measure of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual attacks were registered by the Department of Defence's Department of Sexual Assault Prevention and Responsibility.
But it is well known that the number of sexual attacks is substituted. In fact, according to the own estimation of Pentagone, this number represents about 13,5% of the 19,000 accidents that occurred this year.
The report in March also studys the percentage of judicial proceedings: in 2010, 20% of the cases registered in the Army have made a process - half percentage of the civil court system.
Susan Burke's affairs describe their agression as the first of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman's case, she reports the military police of violence less than one hour after the facts.
This night, she said, we asked her to tell him 11 times in detail his violence to various police, doctors and commanders.
She raised up a "rap kit" (literally a violation kit), and the blood of her agressor - has been found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge, at a procedure in which we question about his sexual relations with his little friend as soon as the day of his attack.
Six people have witnessed as a witness of morality for the author of crime, which has finished being acquired.
"I remember the day when the verdict has been made," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts, and I'm going to cry after the court."
"I was placed in psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember I told my commander, "I wasn't his process, but my."
Elizabeth Lyman has been contrary to consult a military psychiater, which has finished by diagnosticing a problem of personality, which makes it inappropriate to the service.
In January 2010, it has been sent under less honorable terms, the reserve of any benefit.
Is that Lyman's business and other disasters will prevent or not, it's a long story, John Turley, teacher of right to the University of Washington.
But he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to prevent."
Only this critical doctrine since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the doctor Feres.
The army finds decades behind it because it does not have the same benefits and means of dissuasion laid down by responsibility.
"The chances are hard against them, but it's important that they're trying," adds he.
These things change only when goods have the will of fighting.
If the process doesn't turn to their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the pioneers, will gather its hundreds of other plagues for other processes.
"We will continue to fight the army on this question until there is no reform."
Where'd we die, one or another of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before being the new face of the right extreme in Europe, Anders Behring Brevik was a simple man who made part of his online anti-immigration opinions.
Monday, Brevik, who was recognized to have been taken from a murder fool in Norway in July 77 victims, was confronted to his first process.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on the cyberspace: he had passed a large part of the previous time at the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this year, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Simple... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the DEMOS reflexion group on the digital population in Europe.
Facebook provides a lot of personal information, tells Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could just use the public tool of the site to find people who are looking for a scientific precision - the way markets do it for years.
The James Bartlett team discovered that a half-million of members were famous of right extreme groups in Europe, and she had made them with announcements, but instead of remitting them to a new group or product, the announcements invited users to respond to a research. The issues in question were concerned about their level of education, their aspects of violence and their optimism about their future.
In contact with these persons through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues could ask 10,000 party of 14 right extreme party in 11 European countries - without leave the office.
"It's a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not of all surprising: the online party of the right groups are more than men, young and the immigration.
But amazingly, "the ones who associate online and outline activists are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is only a example of how Facebook has become the new incompatible tool between scientists' hands.
Reflexion groups, medical researchers and polytologs use the site to study all the subjects that touch health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love," publications on walls and updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add in average three contents per day, the "Supernova of data" generates a research explosion, increases the number of research works which the site name appears in the title of almost 800% in relation to the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's advantage is in the fact that it allows you to study people you can't approach the street.
"Before, when you tried to carry out research on the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook disappears all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and of his colleagues, the young students who talked about Facebook about their exploitors in the field of ebriety had much more chances to be alcohol than the students discussed on this issue.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as the advice, could monitor the site and intervene to help an eventual student whose statute would speak too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-auteur of Megan Moreno and director of the centre for health, conduct and development of children in the research Institute for children located in Seattle, show Washington Post.
"We know how to identify the children of risk, and who would not be in another case unrecognised."
Facebook also accesss the information of its users.
The "Site team that is occupied data has studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of the Holy Valentine, the participation in the elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (based on available information - digital freedom fields have so long supported that the site could provide its data reserve to others to research purposes).
But the Facebook users know that the website observes them, that it will like or not - by switching to play Scrabble with a friend who is located at thousands of kilometers, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a research that they haven't even heard?
While researchers have good consigns on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't believe that many users have already thought that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, socialologist in London's Connaissance Laboratory, according to a study of 2006, which he sent to observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"Unless they know, the changes were only seen by their friends."
Then the methodology's question comes.
Even without transiting through Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the truth grade of a profile or the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two things totally different," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, although his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block notes and a style remains the best tools that we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are census to address social aspects - and social, it is not before a computer."
"Froid and inhumain": First comparation of Andres Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Brevik, the man who has agreed to organize the two attentions that have made 77 dead in Norway, was described as a fighter of "resistance" when his first appearance to the process that was depressed in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the movement of Norway Resistance and the Templiers of Norway," explains he before an audience room full of 500 people.
"In the matter of the Court's competence, I appreciate it, because you have your mandate of organizations supporting a hate ideal and because it supports multiculturalismo."
"I recognized the facts, but I don't like sinful."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during this monologe because he "not wanted to leave him the opportunity to use this process to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Brevik, who brought with him a paper talk, talking to the parents of the victims at the end of the audience.
The Court Nesheim also asked the police to keep Brevik in prison for more than twelve weeks, forbid him to speak to media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would oversee very closely all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
A 30-year-old parents of survivors and victims were present at the audience.
Some have come in the hope of looking at Brevik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind the bars.
All have participated in audience in order to see the end of the process.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said an Utoya survivor in the Norwegian NRK TV chain.
"I wasn't in the air, but I personally had a little progress after I saw and heard the suspect."
Because of a dark costume and a blue cravate, Brevik remained quiet and professional during all the process. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes inside and out of the court.
Unless the strange idea that Brevik is a large movement of "resistance", the judge decided that it was not foolish. He also said that there is no evidence that he had done with compliances.
The attention of 22 July seems to be the work of a extremist instead of a whole group of radians, which may have some.
But this does not reduce the chagrin or the confusion of all the nations.
"I would prefer him like a monster, but it's not the case," said a father of a victim.
"This would be much easier."
7 we read of the lost interview of Steve Jobs, in the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October last, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the modern computer gene and inventor.
But what Apple's fans can find more discovery in a support of Steve Jobs recently found and which will be spread this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had included product processes and work flux.
He was sure a creator and a dream. He was identifying a hippie, but he was also very metical and organised, as well as a improvement of organic - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "made to think that a great idea is 90% of the work... [but] a significant quantity of manual worker separates a great idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds" series. This series retracts the born of the computer, and he sitted for more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, this was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, regarding a popular adoption from the Internet.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have lost in the transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the garage of the realisator.
This video, easily remonted, is the base of the film of 68 minutes titled by Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be distributed to the next mercredi and games.
For someone who knows to deny the approach, Steve Jobs seems to be surprised here to expose technological philosophy and its commercial strategys.
And incredibly careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, while Steve Jobs claimed clearly his thoughts, in order to bring a specific answer.
We also discover the moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurrected, where he seems impatient to hear the issues of Cringely, gives him cooking couples to accelerate it and pass to issues or subjects of greater importance.
Film before Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strange aspect in Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he consists of good or bad in other companies and makes part of his own vision on the future of the computer.
It's something to read the posthumes evaluations of Steve Jobs Carrie, but there's something of brute and inspiring on the man we see here, the anxiety dream at the ground of the greater.
He has a vision on how things can be and must be.
He explains them afterwards.
Here's a quick recipe of seven notable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned to lead a company:
"In all these years, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers are constantly the same: "Oh, just because you have to do them."
Nobody knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues to give details about its efforts to simplify the accountability in Apple.
Perplexing how costs were recorded - often started by a "normal cost" assessment of nest, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed a automatic use that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to Pape:
Steve Jobs reports the "Blee Box" announcement that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to pick the telephone networks and phone freely in long distance.
The camera made the object of many letters to the prevalence, but Steve Jobs' euphory here in its description of the Blee Booth as a appropriation act is counted.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, through a call and then connecting from a AT & T network to another entirely around as much as possible satellites.
"We developed the bottle of various things a half-douzain once and you smoked in the public phone and it came to you a minute later at the public phone side," explains Jobs at a ride.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Booth, we learned that we could create something able to control billions of infrastructures in the whole world."
We don't know much about both, but we have found a little able to control great things. This was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have been a day without this.
Steve Jobs continued to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak had set at the point: he phoned to the Vatican with the White Boite in the middle of the night by going to Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to Pape.
As many members of the Catholic herarchie are invited in the middle of the night to speak to American diplomats, the two compliances have gone to smile just before the Father himself is raised up.
At his love with technology (and the extent of Bill Hewlett) :
In 12 years, at the age of 12, at the board of the detailed rooms to build a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the year's age and passes a couple of feed.
A few minutes after their conversation, Steve Jobs has a part-time job in Hewlett-Packard.
"This has been a marvelous influence on me, and it was the only business I had seen in this age and this has made my definition of a company and how the employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit business research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "the first office computer ever designed."
He was so big as a valid, having a little cathodic tube, and I fell in love.
The adolescent I've been returned to the HP and started writeing programs for this machine.
On innovation improving:
In several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about investing new products on a head.
At the beginning of his carrier, while it is installed to sell a few printed circuit cards, a client asked him to gather a full computer.
With only 30 days of credit work, it should take care of the meeting and the delivery of the completed devices.
Afterward, at Apple, it remembers difficulties occurred to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember great discussions... I've been crying up by trying to make me five years [to build a mouse that would cost 300 dollars] and I've got enough, I went out and I went to see a conceptor."
Four and twenty days later, we had a mouse we could build for $15 and who would have been incredibly faithful.
On the big companies:
Even before Apple reviewed, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industry leaders had gone to smoke and lose control of their market parts.
"We admit that you worked in IBM or Xerox, do a better copyor or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopole, so the company doesn't meet successfully.
The vessels and marketing can develop it, so [the types of persons] who end by guidance of enterprises and the specialised person in product are set out in the case of decisions.
The gene that led to this monopole position is completely possible by people who can't imagine a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual required work.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have taken all the computer industry.
She could have been 10 times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the default to the victory.
On innovation as artistic form:
"A great part of manual work separates a great idea of an exceptional product, as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn greatly about its subtilities.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can't do, see, robots, nuts.
You have to keep thousands of things in the spirit (the concepts) together one another.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal goods, and it is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said a day that the good artists were joined and that the great artists wanted.
We're still happy to fly great ideas.
This is part of Macintosh exceptional. People who worked above were musicians, poetes, zoologists, historians, who were just the best computer scientists in the world.
If it is not for informatic science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with adversaries of health law while the court is gathered
The day when the Supreme Court is gathered into a closed house to examine the question of political discussion, to know whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of Health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted in a party of a lawyer officer who will defend the business before the high court.
The event was on the last July, when the nine judges were gathered together for a conference to discuss penalties for examination.
One of the issues concerned a process tried by 26 States containing the reform of ambitional health cares voted by the Congress in the last year, a law that had been a raising point for conservative military warrants in the national scale.
The judges have agreed to hear the statement, in fact, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected in March Next, and the result will probably be of nature to improve the destabilisation of the presidency course in 2012, which will be full exorcised at the time the decision of the Court will be made.
A lawyer who will stand before the Court and argument on the rejection of the law will certainly be Paul Clement, who served as a general consultor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The Clement legal cabinet, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of two twelve cabinets that have helped to compare the annual feeding of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a long-term group to defend the conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that have confronted the law, the National Federation of Independent Employment (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promotor was the Pfizer Inc pharmaceutic gender, which presents a large financial injury in the result of the ligue.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the business.
It was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republic of the Senat and the adversary stated of the Health Act.
The invitations come to the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there is nothing going to meet detonology rules.
In fact, the judges are excluded from the code of conduct that regulates the actions of federal courts.
If they were it, they would doubtly say by Canon 4C Code, which points out: "A judge can assist fund collections of organizations related to the right and otherwise that the judge cannot be an intervenant, a honour invitation or found on the programme of such events."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas in the nearby two of the lawyers of the business, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest, is sufficient to warn the activities of the Government Ethics.
"This violation of the ethics and is exceeding indifference in respect of the code against the statements of many judges which the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal courts," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drink and danced and collected a gala funds with lawyers who had cases in instance before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the fund collection of this event exceeds all impartial recognation, and it is inacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for criticisms that they are too easy to meditate the cases of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative military military.
Furthermore, the conservators say that this is the judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general advisor of Obama's administration when the first opposition on the law was carried out at the first instance court.
His critics have been pressed to tell Kagan to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in the law's defence to be impartial.
Kagan had no indication that she would do it.
Boeing records a register command of 18 billion dollars for line flying
The Air Company Emirates ordered 50 Boeing 777, bi-couloirs, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated for more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary to which a company receives a command contemplant 50 of its products.
It's about all the cases when the company is the builder of Boeing and that the amount of those 50 aircrafts gets the record of 18 billion dollars.
It is also incredible of whom Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a larger gold min of future flying commands.
In the lunch previews, the Chicago company estimates that the Aerial Companies in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 were a total value of 450 billion dollars.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the Communities Communities' Communities' command - 50 Boeing 777 bicolars.
It's the air company Emirates based on Dubai who passed this pharaonic command.
Boeing announced to Dubai Airport in 2011 that the air company is also subject to buy 20 aircrafts more, which would increase the total cost of the command to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing stated that the Oman Air company had commanded six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that is a model of important carburant economys and comforts for pasts.
The amount of these six devices is higher than one billion dollars.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analysis of the Morningstar.
"These clients, particularly, have a great value."
In the Middle East, the productor countries have many of their air companies.
They have therefore not only the means of paying these aircrafts, but amount of carburant price - a prejudiceable standard for aircraft companies because it represents their most important costs - it would not be so vulnerable because the country would win money with the price of the petrol.
It is a important point because these companies will be less susceptible than others to evacuate or differ their aviation commands when the price of the petrole increased, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk covering," he said.
The Command of Emirates strengthens Boeing predominance on the market of a large-porter airports and helps to smooth the A350 concurrent competition.
Boeing's victory in the aircraft room comes four months after Airbus announcement reporting the starts of the largest version of A350, which directly revales with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repeated its starts to increase the poussy after the request of his clients to increase its charge capacity and self-nomie.
Boeing company's actions increased 1.5% to achieve $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico manifestly battled with the elections of Michoacan
Louisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped his adversarie Fausto Vallejo del PRI in the course of the government.
The sister of the President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost his trial to access the functions of the Governor of Michoacan during violent elections, and she told the morning that drug traffickers have favored one of her adversaries.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in head of the course to the governor position of this West State.
"The intervention of the crime organized during all the vote process and in particular yesterday is not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," reported Luisa Maria Calderon at the radio during an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They have threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they have been packed with urnes, have installed road bars... and have committed people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI governmented Mexico for sixty-seven years until the presidency was lost in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to be noted just a little of Calderon, who was on the head of the branches before the day of elections.
Calderon, candidate of his brother's conservator party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a vendor.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which is currently occupied by the Governor's functions, has arrived in the third, a penalty in the presidency of 2012 for this left divided and unfortunate.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, ancient master of Morelia, the capital of the State, denied all link to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been a long time dominated by drug carts specialized in marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafic.
This is the State of the origine of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offence against traitors in December 2006.
However, violence has persistent.
One week before the elections, a PAN master was murdered when he made a campaign for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have rejected locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, both corrupted as the elections of Michoacan were aired, a victory will help the party in his elean.
The man who is waiting for representation of the PRI in the course of the presidents, Enrique Pena Neto, welcomed Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraged for the next year."
The BASD urges Asia to come in the euro area
The Asian Development Bank requested India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the crisis of the Sovereign Dependence to avoid a long-term decrease that would prevent the development of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the general director of the BASD based on Manille, stated that the two economic powers to grow in the fastest growth of the world should "to do everything in their power" to accelerate the reaching of the monetary area by the internal Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He declared the BRIC (Brasil, Russia, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe in a "indiffed eye" and reported that a Asian financial support at the side of the leaders and resources of Europe would allow a long-term effort of the world economy.
"We're all together in this crisis."
"For this reason, everyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during a interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected until a certain point, but it's not at open."
"Doc, if China and India can help, that nothing stops them."
In the past months, the euro area has been seriously broken by a crisis of the sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian empire was dangerously mounted in arrows and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have demissioned.
The flowering crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has made the fear of the world's economy to return to recession, and has submitted the call of the major economys to join to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the FMI would support all Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the financial safe funds of the United States, the European Financial Stabilisty Fund - would provide a greater power for negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industries, has indicated that "Inde will do everything that she can" to help the euro area because its own economy is now suffering from a low-down of exports and a taxation of foreign capitals.
"Person only wants the euro area to stay instable and accurate," he said.
"We have monumental deficits to rise and we must keep a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find our work for the decades of millions of our young men and women?"
Others support that developing economys such as India should not help European riches while they face their own important economic deficits.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of the Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be very difficult to accept aid to Europe at 1,2 billion Indians, which at least 800 000 lives with $2 per day, see less.
"A day they will discover that the Greeks take their back to 50 years and go in vacances to the sun and will be bad to warn it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why the India's reserves should be used to maintain many Greek officials who are well payed in bad employment generated losses, such as in the ferry sector.
Mr. Nag declared that the European area's crisis was risked to prevent " significant impacts" through Asia.
The previsions of the BASD of an economic growth of 7,5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now faced by the European threat.
He reported that the vulnerable markets had needed to develop "profit plans" to protect themselves from an economic and important return of capitals.
Pentagone’s warnings on potential defence reductions
The Secretary-General to the Defence, Leon Panetta, raised the pressure on the Monday Congress, warning that automatic budgetary compressions would know the national security. He declared a financial reaction in Pentagone's couloirs to the fields of battle in Afghanistan through civil collections.
The Pentagone has already 450 billion dollars of reduction for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compressions may be imminent if the Congress does not come to a agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastable for the ministry," said Panetta in a letter to the Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He declared that the failure of the Congress to come to a budgetary agreement in which it was called the sequeration, would be 23% of reductions and the egg of many new projects.
"A very important reduction, applied so without understanding, would make most of our ships and projects in executable construction - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and bring severely to other modernization efforts, " write Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be contrary to separate us from some of our civil personals and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should have at least to send citizens in conjunction without payment to achieve the objective."
"These changes would be able to decline the faith of those who support our military and would seriously make our preparation."
The reductions would eventually touch the fighting groups, continue Panetta.
"In order to finance in war periods of contingent operations in the foreign contingent operations not directly touched by the sequeration, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious perturbations in the basic budgets," advised Panetta.
"The contracting personnel would be reduced by leading the contracts and the monitoring of the contracts supporting war."
"The guarantee manager would be reduced, leading payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be sustained."
The two senators had written in Panetta 10 days later, requesting details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have discovered a quick decline of the United States as a world-wide leader of military power."
"We are farocally opposed to this dracony action," said the senators in a common communicated afternoon in the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"It's not a consequence that we can live, and it's certainly not what we should impose."
"Security is a threat for the national security interests of the United States, and it would not have to happen."
That the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagone of reduction, remains to see.
Panetta was more virus about the potential compressions, even if he had become the highest position of Pentagone in the Congress and the White House, and knowing that he was compared to difficult choices.
In a press conference last week, the secretary to the Defence took a shadow table of what could happen - a military with a cooking, but not a noise.
"It's a ship without sea."
"It's an unbalance branch."
"It's a chase fly, without enough pilots formed."
"It's a paper tigre, an army of casers, buildings and bombs that have no enough military formed to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his preliminary notes in Pentagone.
"It's a depressed, bad prepared and unable to face potential adversaries."
"In fact, she invites the aggression."
In an addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has set up specifically how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: response to crises, conflicts and catastrophes; several limits to our capacity to develop and attach us into the world; and the risk is not acceptable in future battle operations."
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defence projects could go to the cut, including those already tested and some just to the first planning towns.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new bombardier, the Balistic submarine of new generation, the new literary battle ship and the new landing vehicle, which would replace the Army and Sea Humvee.
With a term for development and tests of the F35 may generate 80 billion of economies over 10 years, but the parties say that it is a essential step for improvement and responsibility to the potential threats of China and other rivages.
How To Repeat a Liar
A look at the recent manchets indicates how the tromperies and the lies are completely in the daytime life.
The Republican candidate to the President Herman Cain is occupied to replace sexual harmful allégations with several women; each side accusing the other to lie.
Penn State Administrators have been accused of condemnation for immediately covering reports in accordance with which a football driver to the retreat has been agressed sexually by the boys.
The last week, the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a open mixed microphone confirming the President Barack Obama that the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The liar has destroyed carriers and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebration of the Internet Anthony Weiner is passed for a idiot, quickly exempting depressions that are unrefusible evidence.
The ancient candidate to President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to covering an extra-conjugal link.
And then, no one of those who lived the story will never forget the medical circle that President Bill Clinton declared lying in his second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The reports of training to school tests and university are legal.
There were cases where the teachers gave the answers to the students to make sure their performance assessments.
The mentors who should teach the contrary shall send the message according to which lies and trichery are acceptable.
How many tromperies do we met?
On a date given, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lying.
In fact, many of them are liars.
Another study showed that strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or repeating lies is an essential competence that each one should, at times, acquire personal and professional reasons.
Beyond being a similar society game, we say, charades, where the objective is to write: "I have you", the detection of the trompery is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientist data collected during the past six decades in university prestigious universities, which have put a research in depth of such projects, in particular in psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest mythes on the lying have been demist.
The liars look at you in the eyes.
They don't beaten, rose or do not always act.
Don't conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to disappear.
A qualitative lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the facial expressions, the training of the question and the response time.
I have passed several years to examine scientific results in the large body and always humbled the knowledge of the tromperies, and it is clear that the detection of tromperies is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to ship in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities includes the embassy, interviews, negotiation or management.
The good lies are happy to read others, putting them into the ship, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others do.
We know about researchs that extravagants lying more than the introverts, that men say more lying "centred on them" while women say more lying "centred on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married persons lying less than their partners who are not married (but the liars that they tell the tendency to be great).
We also know that if you are persuaded as a falsehood, others will feel less guilty to lie to you.
How can you say if someone's lying?
First, watch the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we're called "increasing data".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure further changes.
See the posture of your subject, the rire, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone usually turns his feet in permanently to not launch unjust accusations when you see the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for amazing and non-verbal trembler behaviour.
Consider these indications as red drapeaux, not the evidence of the trompery.
Trumpers can immobilize the top of the body when they are trying to remember their story, they can put their feet to the door, shoot up to a output, change posture significantly, or present a "post-interview" supply - a exaggerated supply of suffering, a posture change when all difficult questions are past.
The questionnaires often indicate failure that the maintenance is just finished to declare the post-interview reaction.
Take attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The festival Scott Peterson depressed by using the past, intended that his murdered wife was alive, declaring a national research to find her.
Trumpers can also use a remote language: "I have no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a very difficult question.
The most common indicators are subtilized.
Someone can use a lot of "bow tongue" when he replies to a difficult question, "Well... to say true... if I remember good... my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive answer instead of factual and often is a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detection of lies, but the development of competences to recognize tromperies is possible.
These competences will improve the chances of anyone to escape the victim by arnachers in their professional and personal life.
The controversed oleodoc plan will be interrupted after the late approval of the United States
A few days after Obama's administration, Obama's adoption of an oleoduc project between Canada and the Golf of Mexico - reaching the wrath of syndicates with the environmentists - the society to build oleoduc says that it is ready to redirect the project to replace it on the roles.
TransCanada declared tomorrow that she will move the pipeline projected outside the ecological sensitive area of Nebraska, and it is confident that the project will also win its approval.
The company announced the decision in a press conference to Nebraska Capitol.
The TransCanada Office, Alex Qubax, tell me that the company remains confident that it will end by obtaining the approval of an oleoduc, but with a different inheritance.
This takes place after the State Department on the last week that he would keep his decision to take a federal permission for the project until he receives new potential inheritors studys that allow the areas of Nebraska and Ogallala, large subterranean water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental exam of the State Department would probably have repeated any decision until 2013 after the elections of the next year, although the officials deny the impact of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed its support.
The oleoduc of 2,735 km from Canada to the golf of Mexico.
He would transport 700,000 bars per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas raffineries.
To do this, he would have to travel through six States.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by work groups, which have put on the 20 000 jobs affected with oleoduc.
But Nebraska's legislators against this plan are pressed by a law to strengthen the district of Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquiry region, a major source of potable and irrigation water.
The study of environmental impacts in the State Department found that the project would have only negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the General Ministry inspector ordered a distinct investigation from the test process.
The one is that a lobbyist income by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a conseller of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is to know whether an undertaking that has been busy for the first study has been an inadequate choice from his relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continues for immediately caused a young child to be scared
A family of New York indicates that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle was launched in a violence detonation in the hall of their building in Manhattan, was threatened her little girl at the point where she was scared of fear.
The chair of the "Lady Marmalade" took the small Geneviève Monk age of 18 months, so that she had submitted "the changes of personality, the difficulties of the dream" and "the great fear of strangers," said her family during the process of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was the 10 November of the last year when Kevin Monk, his wife teacher of children's garden, Roseanna, and Geneviève were prepared to travel in family.
While Kevin Monk was going to look for the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the hall of their bullevard Riverside building with their bags, bringing Geneva into his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she was arrested by the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Anyone happened behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yeah" and I went to look for her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the ungrate woman with anger.
"He said to me about one of your attackers, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think isn't interested in me."
She became crazy and began to use jurons - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to spread me with the water of the bottle.
She said that Geneviève has become historical.
"I said to that woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle fell on the mom - who always holded Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her around that he entered him into a car who waited for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl wept so strong as she got to smoke, adds it.
Afterward, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's excuses, but there was no answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle have not returned our calls to comment.
The discourage of non-specific pains, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family intends to make a gift of all money received in a charity work against the cancer for children.
"The goal is to have Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally inacceptable, especially to a mother teacher who brings a child of 18 months."
The climate disagreement has broken the economy
In the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, the comfort and information has increased, the external investment has been down and the economy has been contracted
2011 is a year in which the economic history of Sinaloa is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, automatically called the change, which has generated great aspects in the progress of the economy, but the climate adverseness of the beginning of the year is not observed, where there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in particular to cause billion losses for agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of State economy for growth, caused a contraction of the economic activities in general by 3,6 per cent in the first semester of the year, which was mainly justified by the low history of 31,16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the Report of Affairs by the Mexican Council of Rural Development, there were 582 million 835 hectares, which a 78,03 per cent suffered total sufferings and the remaining of 21,07 per cent have suffered partial disagreements, the major cultures have been the laws, the mass and the fish.

Liquidity monetary
The commitment to Sinaloa during the year is multifactoral, according to the Economic Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Economic and Social Science Faculty of the UAS, can be expressed indirectly according to the actions made by the public policy.
"It is observed that it is a higher degree of the complaint that has been given to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the law approved in the Congress to fight the whiteness of money, because for people who won the dollars in an illegal way it is not easy to work to win them, to invest them and to use them in something," said he.
migration arrested
López Cervantes stated that the height of the challenge is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to go to work for foreign, the United States has been restricted, first because of income and secondly, because they have already a lot of difficulties to find the work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which makes the higher commitment."
Serious missing
The analysis of the employment market is aware of the high level of serious failure that predominates between work conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38% of the population occupied in this state and works without coating as a worker in no social security institution.
On the basis of the commitment and the failure of seriousness, another reason of delay for the state is the low salaries, the entity has the lower rewards in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Securities and the Working Secretariat and Social Prevision.
The average monthly income of the Single Workers was, until September, 55,000 352 pesos, very lower than the national average, which is located at 70,000 375 pesos.
IED Contraction
In 2011, the highest reduction of the Foreign Direct Investment in the past 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economic Economic June to June, the EED of the State has achieved 630 000 697 dollars, which represents a rate of 87.74 per cent in relation to 5 million 143,000 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
At its tour, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State's accounting is a total investment of 17.280 billion per year, mainly recorded by third sector companies.
Leave this
As the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State concerned in July at the public Congress the approval of a credit of 3 billion pest, destined to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipes, with the objective of reactivation of the economy, the approval of the State congress has been 2,600 billion pesos and until November has not been observed any benefits of the investment in no sector of the State's economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patronal sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a missing management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Industrie of Transformation Chamber, stated that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the volunteers of various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The reward of Sinaloa's economy for this year was really poor, we need to work intensely to reach the country we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has failed to justify the efforts of all and especially the good way already synchronized of this new government team, hope that the next year is much better," said he.
Economic Leader
Loredo López stated that events such as the beginning of the year have held the State's economy and have restricted its increase and growth.
"The Economic Flex is produced from many events, among which it is, one of the main effects has been a low economy that does not turn fast enough to generate a economic dynamism which allows a acceptable and flux level in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are locked much under the accommodations we had," said he.
Redefine Call
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, stated that it would like to cancel the State to productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general, we have observed that we have worked, we think that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that re-determines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that the potential of material and human resources in Sinaloa is detailed."
Many to do
The Chairman of the Coparmex submitted the importance of establishing a future vision that can improve the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various areas, in economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme."
He reported that the current administration has shown progress in the way the public policy is management.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more included, what I can say is that we have been working many and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," he said.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marihuana
A resident person in Novolata was condemned at five years of prison and 100 days of emergency for eight kilos of marihuana.
The General Parquet of the Republic informed that the small trailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, in his variety of marihuana's possession destined to sell.

These to the contributions to works
As regards the social characterworks in programmes such as Habitat, Reserve of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are risked to be completed where to record severe retards from the missing economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda reported.
The Municipal Social Development Director stated that even if the construction programmes have progressed, they are in a risk situation, because the Government of the State has not been committed to its obligations to offer contributions over 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He reported that the investment of these three programmes is at least 50 million pesos, from which the State must provide 25 per cent and until now only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for work, so there is the possibility of a length in their finalisation.
"They must offer a contribution of 12 million and, although the year's time, they'd not have given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a party," he said, "and we, in order to not save the late, started the works and we had a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that in the past year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore, at the beginning of administration, the Municipe had had to ask a credit to cover the seven million that the administration of the State had not provided to this opportunity.
"We had already submitted this in the previous sex period because the State had no economic capacity to participate and programmes continued to work and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we agree to get resources to cover what the State had not paid," detailed.
While there is an obligation of the authorities of the State to provide these resources, he declared that they had made the request to the Secretary-General of Administration and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to enable the management of the corresponding percentages to come fast.
"They need to provide about 12 million and, at least, that the year will soon end, they have nothing given us."
The valid Court "The Analogic Court" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered last years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has raised the constitutional controversies that the Senat and the Chamber of the Deputy have made against the President's decree that has prevented the "analogic counsel" of 2021 to 2015, because the eight required votes for invalidation have not been meetings.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that the President Felipe Calderon has not exceeded its properties when he has exceeded the decree that determines the actions to follow to concrete the transition to the digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoved by the Secretary-General of the Republic has been deployed to not achieve the qualified majority of eight votes to pronounce the Court on the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the Decree, and this continues to be enforced.
The draft sentence, established by the Ministry Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, due to the fact that radio and TV regulation is a law reserved by the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contrast of the principles of herarchical subordination and law.
For the project, only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero have voted.
With this argument, as the Senat and the Chamber of the Deputy, two constitutional controversies have prompted to protest the decree and admit the plains, the Minister Sanchez Cordero has suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions provided by this for digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministry has decided that the statement also made by the Deputy Chamber, without discussing the project which the Ministry Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his intervention, the President said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the meaning that the Federal Executive cannot struct through general rules the measures to prepare public administration.
"I consider not more than if it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which is for the constitutional mandate of the State's direction.
The replacement of analogic signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the last years and it is translated into a better operation of the radio-electric spektrum, a better quality of signal and more strings.
Updating the change, has supported, would be updated by the benefits of digitalization which implies a public interest decision that does not only have a technical size, "cause it also includes economic, social, political and national security."
These questions, "required the operation of all a system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attributions that the Constitution apply to the capacity of the Executive of the State."
He mentioned that many countries of all have already finished digital transition and have done it through the Executive, although they had strong technical organs specialized.
It is not possible to conclude that the Executive, exempting the stated decree, has devoted the competence of the Congress, because it ensures the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data provided by the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the Government ' s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 74 74 total proceedings.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" is a reality in the electoral process in Michoacan this year, where, according to the data provided by the Preliminary Research Programme (PREP), the differences between the first and the second place of the Government ' s election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 74 total proceedings.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of Michoacan Electoral Institute (IEM), Mary of Los Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the electoral body has adopted a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards in the federal reform of the electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán has not homologated nor his political Constitution, nor its electoral Code of State or its Electoral Act, while the State Congress has approved the reforms as far as the legal period has finished that this electoral procedure may enter into force and Government Leonel Godoy Rangel has disappeared its publication in the periods provided by the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that it had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy of the local Législative Pouvoir and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state mandator for constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to "senction or contest".
Interviewed on the possibility of vote by vote, Mary of Los Angeles Llanderal stated that by approval of the guidelines relevant by the General Council of IEM, it would be possible to complete partial and all votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial detail of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of verbal processes are not consistent; there is no scrutin-verbal proceedings and detail in the urne dossier are not in the president of this; or there are clear errors or adverse advantages of the processes.
Furthermore, the total degree of the votes received in all urines of the election may be fulfilled when there is a index of the fact that the differences between the candidate proposed to win the respective election and who has received the second place in the scrutin is equal or below a percentage point; in the case that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition presented the second of the signed candidates.
The total degree of the scrutin can be fulfilled as if at the end of the common degree results that the difference between the candidate who was gained and the second place is equal or low to a percentage point, where there is the explicit petition of the representative of the policy party, which the candidate was issued secondly, if the electoral packages were excluded from the party.
It is necessary to note that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where the differences between the first and second place are only 0.16 per cent, even without counting the 129 votes of 923 total processes.

The new Italian government will be formed in mercredi
The first Ministry designed, Mario Monti, will be meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the border of the economic disaster
The first Ministry designed, Mario Monti, will be gathered with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the border of the economic disaster and has lost all Eurozone.
A Communicator of the Chairman Palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that it presents a cabinet in its majority by technocrates, even if it is not clear when the new executive will summarize its position.
Monti said that he would present the result of his discussions with the political parties in his trying to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to exceed this difficult phase," said the ancient European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the sound of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been exhausted.
"The frame is now well tracked," added he.
Monti completed the process to form a government at least three days, in a more reduced time as usually, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has put the costs of its debt to unable to support.
The new administration guided by the European Commissary Monti must approve a hard outside package required by European leaders to reach the trust in Italy.
Understanding the pressure on Monti to delay, the instability of the markets to place the reward of the Italian BTP obligations to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were both saved.
Emma Marcegagli, leader of the Italian patron Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government much."
We think that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy for this urgent situation.
The possibilities of success in Monti were significantly stimulated by the support of the PDL Partie of Silvio Berlusconi, where the crisis has committed to demission the past Sunday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano press, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the most largest Italian party, is significant because many of its members were opposed to the Government of most technocrate that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what may probably be immune extern reforms.
All blocking or leading in its efforts could cause a new and devastable financial market attack.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks was added to the pressure observing that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started meetings on day with political, syndicate and parent groups and young and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish his train of meetings on the evening.
Moni was named Sunday by Napolitano, which has obtained a extremely quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a short time at the end of the past week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would demission, the costs of the Italian debt have now been returned to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new Ministry.
Saving Italy, with a public rate of 1,9 billion euro, it would be too much for the current Eurozone financial defences.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections provided for for 2013, without general preventions on the fact that politicians will only give him the time to apply the reforms before the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should be formed only by specialists, a index of their objectives before a financial pressure process.
Political sources have reported that reciproc mistakes and disagreements between parties are fulfilled by the trying to include political figures.
Spanish experience is greater than costaricians
22 footballers called Spain, 10 participated in more than 50 international games.
From the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convocated attended 50 meetings.
A great contrast to the Costa Rica, if it is compared to the 22 convocated by both countries for today's friendship at 15:05 hours in San José National State.
While the national and European campaigns number one of the FIFA monthly class, a large record of inter-selective games of class A, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Humana as the only to have the 50 international matches.
This number has been achieved the past Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Romel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Ligue of Stars and in the powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain a intense activity in national ligue campionships and discussions in the European Cookies, such as the League Chambers.
At all this, it is necessary to add experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Coupe and the Football World.
Costarican footballers, in contrast, have an international experience limited to a area, such as Concaf, which is considered a lower level in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish selection is the guarder of Iker Casillas, which the previous Sabbath against English (defense 0-1 in London) has equaled the record of the old guard of Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will put a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral flight from Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were also recognized the previous week by the EUFA at the cost of the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the former center of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Preparing centenary number is found Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Jabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniasta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the costarian part, and near Michael Umana is the left side of Junior Dyaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz buyer, with 45.
After this, only five have passed over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presents, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myria with 23.
The rest doesn't even arrive at 20.
While Nano Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not started yet.
The historical buyer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 moons, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records it with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myria and Parks.
Fifty has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajector
"Aler to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real."
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bassist Jeff Amen, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National State.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that it will also be a dream of reality to happen in this country.
It is that the bassist and member of the founder Jeff Amen assures, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, the past week.
The group is located in the South-American airport of its celebration tour of two decades of work, and it will make its unique scale in Central America.
This day will be presented on the National State from 19:30, next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, which is the full transscription in the La Nation on the Internet.
For his costarician adepts, the fact that Pearl Jam will produce in Costa Rica is a real dream. Do you know what you are doing?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and it has been great until now.
I've passed in Costa Rica only once the vacances; it's a country so beautiful and I think we can pass for a few days.
That is why we emotionate to bring our music in there.
I ask you, because there's a kind of devotion in the group, the fans live with intensity in the past days.
What is your message for your best adapted?
Thanks for staying near us all these years.
It's missing 21 years to come to Costa Rica. Thanks for waiting so much and we're sorry for the fact that it had been long enough to pass to this concert.
Some people already say that their concert is the greatest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the largest shows we offered for the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We offered two giant shows to Sao Paulo and hope that this has set us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impressive of us to produce it.
We love this country, we love to make surface and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and her vagina to make surf?
We have many surface friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarando and the vagues are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make surface in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in Mexico, are great places to make surf; so we learned it through people who love the surf.
When you saw the tour, you offered great shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we never produced there, we have no restrictions in what we can do.
We'll try to make the best possible show, with a large variety of songs; we'll try to interpret two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and different directory.
You'll never repeat the directory.
What do you need to do?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everybody loves different songs, so it's very difficult to choose what songs to interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory we haven't more interpreted since long, this helps us to stay concentrated and surprise because this reminds us of the reasons for which we love these songs and that we can forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it's also more interesting for people.
With this turn, you will celebrate 20 years of trajector.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all you have done?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think no one of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact we did it for over 20 years ago that it looks like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to do music together is very emotioning us.
We love and love to create music.
We are happy to go to the world's places where we always wanted to go.
The things couldn't go better for us.
What does the fact that you have been a fundamental element in the creation of the bridge?
This was always a honor for us to form part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the Soundgarden people, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprised when a move exceeds a group of friends and is a little common.
From time in time, a group exceeds from a city, but it is much more stranger when five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city.
We are honourable and is a honor for us to form part of the Seattle group.
We're still playing with some of them in time.
The past year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we are happy to be friends with them and it's a honor to form part of this Seattle's sound.
It's too weird that a group like your one holds together and with the same members for a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) have met us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally.
First, I think we're all happy to be still alive and, in second place, we're all worried for others.
We are all intime friends and thanks to that there are musical boulevards that give freedom to each of the experience.
We have confidence in each other with the music of each one, and it could not be better.
Your relationship with the festival word was not easy; however, through your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it was easier to find a balance.
We assure that we don't pass too much time to turn because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, this helps us not forget that we must respect the music and what has brought it, without putting up the fact that we are honorable and a rock star, which does not really interest in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Good?
I think we have written good songs and at the beginning this was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we didn't publish a disc before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations for the fact that she was so little and most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think to the incredible person that Andy had been and how it had been ridiculous, it was always a pleasure to work, laughing, talking about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and he missed us.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for opening it?
Yes, the production has sent to us videos with various proposals, and it was the group that we loved most, so we are impatient to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and that must be very distracted.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
This is a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's the song and I think he's doing it with the first words he's imagining.
As bassist, what are your influences?
There's a lot of...
From the first ones I remember there's Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukoski...
There are many influences, that I could talk about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed to maintain the relevance of the fact that this is not in the mode?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think, this reminds me of the groups I came to mention, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have risen at the same time and, if that is relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's the painful to hear and the groups like Mudhoney do now the best music as ever.
In the beginning, his music had a more dark content and now this has become more positive.
What should this change be done?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem easier, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, as very dark songs, even if these can dream a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I wept when I heard them, and these are deep dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a traumatic in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and these songs, sure, they represent it for me.
I also think we can also be happy and even like that we can do the obscure music.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical tests
The ancient President Alberto Fujimori was married in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle force that he presents in the feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, of 72 years, who purchases a penalty of 25 years of prison for violations of human rights committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers of various affections, including a language cancer for which it has been operated four times and who is under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, declared that Fujimori will be assessed for three days in the National Institute of Neoplassic Maladies to determine why the pain and the loss of force in its low members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion, Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of penalty for humanitarian reasons, he said that this would not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times of tongue cancer, he has a loss of ponderal pests of 18 kilos, and other pathogens, such as a serious exhaust gastrite, a pancreas cyst, renew calculations, arterial hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, fulfilled the doctor.
Fujimori purchases the reclusion since September 2007 in the National Director of Special Operations of Police.
In April 2009, he was condemned at 25 years of prison for death of 25 people because of an army annihilation scenario that had acted preciously during the first years of his government.
Musical travel to Mexico to consolidate political links
A official court, with the President of Uruguay, Joseph Mujica, and formed of various ministers and captains, will initiate a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and to address political themes in the region.
Mujica will meet the next Mercedes with his Mexico homolog, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a long-term meeting agenda with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of uruguay residents in Mexico, according to the agenda distributed by the Uruguay President.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proceeded for information in political matters between two nations", according to the information published by the President of the South America on its website.
According to the local media, Musical searches for convicture Calderon to support Uruguay in the case with France when the French mandator, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South-American country on the list of fishing paradises, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his talk, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the international community countries who continue to be fishing paradises, a declaration that provoked the reject of Uruguay and the call to consultations of its ambassador of this European country.
Mexican Presidency since November G20, a group of more stronger and more developed countries in the world, and has enhanced with the South America countries since January this year, a convention to exchange fiscal information to avoid double imposition.
The Uruguay Government tried for the last years to discharge the concretation of fiscal change agreements to exit the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE), integrated by countries that do not implement all international fishing cooperation standards.
On the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been forced since 2004 a Libre Trade of Trade (TLC) who increased the change of goods between both nations.
The moustachu plombier goes to three sizes with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struck, infectible, for 25 years to save the Prince Peach of the challenges of the wicked Bowser, but he never did it in three sizes: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of young in the stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month to the officers of all the world, has been designed since the beginning to explore the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without use of balls.
"Mario is the personnage that should say how to work the stereoscope without lunettes," said the Nintendo specialized press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez has indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game designed first for this support", because until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo port-word supported that, save being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simply" to increase the less faible users.
Once up, the most experts can make a "second turn" at game levels, which this time are more difficult.
Furthermore, users can choose at real time between a "agressive D" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different disagreements and "not succeed to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also suggests the return of the person to a mobile console, which has not passed since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games, Nintendo makes an eye clin on the saga adeptes and repeats the success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plombier must explore mines of loss platforms to free the Princess Peach.
Even if I find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the cases of Luigi "good."
Colom gives its avail to Portillo extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced the past March that he had given order for the ex-extraction of the old Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the whiteing of 70 million dollars.
So it ends the procedure that Guatemala responds to the request of the north country which called Portillo to judge it.
In the press-conference, Colom stated that his decision was obtained to the independentness of the judicial and executive power, taking into account that a court of the first instance had already commanded his extradition.
He said that during his mandate, "He didn't help" in no judicial resolution, and he gave all extraditions he knew.
At Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will also be extracted for serious murders and serious lessons, and Edgar Strata Morales and Victor Strata Paredes will be extracted for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done has suggested a executive approach after the exhibition of all judicial and constitutional institutions to judge the ancient mandator of the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extracted after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and after ensuring its human rights.
Portillo was absolutely for Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was President, who was the process before the extradition, but the Ministry of Public called and reactived the case.
Trinijove helped 6000 young people in risk situation
The entity is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The budget of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6000 young people in the risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This is added to the long centuries of workshops that are currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make the balance in a festival act in an ancient complex industries of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people have assisted.
Trinijove was born in Trinidad Vella's room in 1986 with the objective of helping little formed people, without work, with toxicomany or marginalised problems.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of entities and institutions that have cooperated with the association in those 25 years.
The variety of political representation, in full electoral saison, showed the unitary character of the work made by Trinijove.
At the President of the Regional Government of Catalan (Gerality), Artur Mas and his President Jodi Pujol assisted the old Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the elder of the More and currently advised the Eco-social Municipal Ricard Goma.
We also assisted in the great room of Fabrica i Coats the current Minister of Best Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the General Director of Love of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove is born in a very difficult time, and it is currently also, but he added that the work done until now is a good basis.
The President gave Trinijove for example to fight the wrong circumstances and to give hope to people in difficult.
"The crisis is not anything again for the entity and the work that is done," said he.
Propriety invaded by squatters for micro-feets, evacuated
Invaders were appropried from 11 of 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have left the property at midnight without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the cachemar that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived alive.
Twelve people have left the building on the middle yesterday voluntaryly, and where they were organized micro-fests who disappeared neighbors, by judicial order and without need of a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock of the door has changed to abuse that the situation is repeated.
"After this day there will be a control of access," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had evacuated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest was living-, brought electronic installation and a part of the water, in part of the walls and left there residues, especially alcohol wood boxes.
The three first apartments were the scene of mass feasts, which were along two days and disappeared the lots.
Near the building there is a discotech, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europe Press that its business was low 80% since the building's employment.
The officer of the diskety stated that the property invaders made him a lot of competence, because they sold the branches to three euros, while they were 10 in the discotech.
Furthermore, the owner of the loyal loyalty had to respond to the neighbors' claims for the dream, while, according to this, the challenges were not provoked by the clients of the discotech, but by the occupied house, and especially the participants in the party organizated there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the unrestrict neighbors of the area.
The responsibility of the discotech explained that the challenges were so big that she even had agreed with the owner of the building, and that's been nine months that this "that's forgiven" to betray him.
The Urbana Guard (Municicipal Police) also confirmed that the last weeks they had received more plains from the neighborhood part of this situation.
The President of the Municipal PP Group of Maria, Alberto Fernández Dyaz, had concerned the past week, "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the common and citizen problems that the residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular manager explained that before the age was only a stage of the building was occupied, but last months the squatters had been occupied all the stages of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "he needs to end with immunity and to be impropriate against the anti-social behavior generated in property."
Yesterday, Moscows (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police was moved to Rue Mont-ral number 35, after having received the call of a neighbor who had noticed that four people were accessed to the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Parc or mountain?
Architects consistently on the opportunity of convocation beyond the Polemic on Honors
The municipal concorrence on the 16 gates again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, full support of the metropolitical Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed the promotion shows of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the big park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Furthermore, she also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the top limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one who does not earnest north-south-sud, but high (mount) - low (mer).
Collserola's quality as natural park is in the increase of this idea.
The reference was not more Central Park, but Yellowstone, with blooders in the role of the Yogi ours.
This was the situation until, in September, María invited a massa-competition combined by 16 concors for all gates of access to Collserola.
A gate is at the park idea, uncertainly.
That's it, or somebody wants to put the doors into the field.
The question would be only: Collserola: park or mountain?
The concours, as regards its organization, as well as in the view of the city, is a discussion theme of all Barcelona architectes.
It is almost a recurrent theme that two members of this old castle of elus are talking about when they are recognised in a assessant.
And this is just one of the rare opinions on which three architects of Barcelona, university teachers, who have been presented there.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: the concours is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the literary front "the needs" to discuss on "the mountain front" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda, the green house pattern was not finally sent.
"It needs from the base that the most extensive park of Barcelona is the area.
In addition to other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the verdict gave the architect for which the title of "Collserola's ports" covers a "legal pigeon": it is not necessary to think about these "come access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which you need to act."
Modl, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifys the proposal as "intelligent defies" with "quality losses".
Perils from the "insurance of the projection of the public space" after the experience living in the '80s, which had been in the Forum' area "Sing of Cine".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Limiter something means to set up the next step," it means his pass.
"We need to think about new urbanistic instruments, planning, because the current [reference to the General Metropolitin Plan (PGM)] can cause disauthorises."
In addition to the question, Model thinks that, simplifying, the Valles of Collserola's region "and may be heard as a park, the Barcelona, no."
Modl reminds that there is already a work made by the Patron of Collserola which "not must be lost" thanks for the opportunity that María offers his corporation to interfere in this project "for the first time".
Moreover, he hears that the nearby of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "true" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," he said, "We, the architects, we should only be a tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the concourse bases are missing a global vision of Collserola: "We have invited 16 transverse concors - says - in the meaning of the mountain-mer, but there is no long-term reading that sees and understands the area in its room."
This is, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 concours.
Otherwise, a project that one of the doors can shoot in the program and definition with the architect of the neighbour door.
In its opinion, yes, the Madrid should ensure that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should prevent, in all its extension, a range of equipment that makes a double transition between the city and the Green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larazabal and this will be delivered freedom
After 72 days of provisional arrestation, Casino Red's legal power fund has obtained forgiveness to the brother of Monterrey's master for the process initiated against him for challenges
After 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonas Larazabal will be released freely after the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red offers him the forgiveness before the Second Penal Court of the District, which follows a procedure to sing against the brother of Monterrey.
After the attention of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas required him the payment of a financial quote to allow Monterrey's master to allow the clandestin functioning of the game's house.
After the public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the PANIST master and on 2 September that was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agency of the Public Ministry 3 of Patrimonial Delites, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Ancient Quartier of the capital of the State.
In the next 49 days, there was a second detention order after the Agency of the Public Ministry was raised up the corruption and delicious delays.
On October 19, it was transferred to the Penal Centre of Cadreyta to make a singing with a million and half pesos the owners of Casino Red, but only a few hours passed in the central detention center because there were a death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the process covered in the municipal cells of San Nicolás of Los Garza.
On 25 October, a capture order was issued by the Court of the Second Penal Court of the District, Jorge Yanez, which said that at nearly two months of investigation there were sufficient evidence to determine the sinfulness of Jonas, as regards the exchange of 1,5 million pests of representatives of the Game's house in order to allow its function.
This morning, the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, was presented by the judge Joseph Luis Pecina to care for the brother of the region's master; therefore he could receive his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Agency of the Public Ministry, Ramiro Aria, asked Garcia Gomez if the dommage was received, and who of the joy's partners was the one who had obeyed the forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
In accordance with article 197/2011, the legal forgiveness of Jonas Larazabal shall be obtained, and later there will be no reclamation on the process tested against him; it will not be requested to him any reparation of destructions and any chastisement.
After the audience of the foundation of the legal power of the game house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larazabal Breton was ordained.
The Corporation of the Court, Jorge Yanez, moved to the prison of San Nicolás de Los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he was legally forgiven and would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom that the judge has ejected.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Yacome communicate the details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and other seven persons
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results were made in evidence of the event in which his life was lost the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons, indicating that the helicopter had stretched directly against the ground in structural integrity, without that the pilot could try a strong aircraft.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, Secretary of Communications and Transports, the pilot stated that the climate conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the earth, the palaces have contacted the trees at 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuel."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it satisfied the requirements necessary for transporting the personnel.
Furthermore, he said that the investigations in the field of impact does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In an investigation, we reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passagers and satisfied the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a smoke of seven to 30 grades of inclination.
For this time, the Secretary-General ensures that a priority is to have the most quickly possible results, but the investigation can perform a few months, even a year.
At his tour, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Airports and Help Services, ensures that the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Majesty President's state had worked in speed to cross, and that happened on a moving ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal function to cross at the time of the impact," said he.
During the press conference, the SCT Officer, Perez Yacome, raised six important elements in the investigation:
Visible volum:
According to the aircraft rules, the air has been fulfilled according to the rules of the visual aircraft, which implies that the equip should have visibility during the air and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM were mentioned appropriate conditions to the decolation, and the aircraft measured that the aircraft had progressed to the limit zone between DF and Mexico.
Selected routes:
It is likely that the team has seen a lower and more visibility area in the valley of Cuernavaca.
The location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last registration of the aircraft on the radar corresponding, probably before the income, there was no loss of control or allocation of the air traffic.
Disparency of the remaining aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available until this time allows to suspect that the impact has been on a right and side trajector.
The spreading model of the remaining aircraft allows to suspect that the helicopter has been structural integrity conditions.
We have not detected fire or explosion traces:
In the left place there is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The recent results of the investigation indicates that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the earth.
During the ground works, the airports were found at a height of 9,000 200 feet above the average sea level, the sun had a pente from seven degrees to 30 inclination levels.
Photographies show the sequence in which it may be disarmad during its treatment.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have multiple effects with the earth.
After a minute research in a larger area than the location in the case of the accident, there were no spread parts of the air, which supports the presumption that the impact has occurred in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announcement protocol for finding the genius of obsession
Social assessment leads a research to discover the kind of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Affairs (IMSS) announced that he leads a research to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the "Genetic Protocol of Obedience of Children and Adolescents" that allows the markers associated with superpoids.
In a communicating, the chief of the Medical Inspector Unit in Biochimie of the National Medical Centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, sisters, nutritionists and social assistance.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the third cycle of the National Health Institute of Public Health (INSP) and of the National Polytechnical Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate the population with or unrighteously, to present to the participating sport units of the IMSS in Mexico Valle, where the evidence of the minors are conducted from 8:00 hours.
He submitted that the protocol started in the Cuauhtemoc Sport Unit (Mexican Poniente State) and that from 8 October, the activities are deployed in the Nezahualcoyolt Sport Unit (East Mexico).
After achieved the objective of meeting 500 or 600 min, the study will continue in the Sport Independence Unit (south of Federal District) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (North of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and it knows the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obsession and to identify in children and young Mexico factors to prevent the appearance of chronic genetic diseases.
As celebrated on 14 November, the World Day of the Diabeth, he mentioned that the objective is to meet three thousand children and young children between six and 14 years, with the consent and monitoring of their parents, for the application of specific issuers relating to food.
They will also be asked for their physical activity and their family relatives of heritage of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that declare affections such as diabetes or renewlessness.
It has detailed that the samples will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measures (poids, size, circumference of size), artérial pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the search for identifying people associated with child obsession).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the fruit of the concern of health professionals for the alarm taken pests in the case of minors.
"The health investigations in 1999 and 2006 have reported that in the case of the boys, 77 percent in obedience and in the case of 47 percent of girls, in the case of the superpoids, there was also a dramatic height," sublines the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the correction for the search of markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that in the middle, the Mexicans have 65% of indo-American heritage, a 30% European and a five% of African and this condition reflects in people associated with diabetes and superpoids.
He explained that, in general, the genetic obsession was translated into the incapacity of burning the excessive energy (calories), which is deposited under the shape of grass.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the entire assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they have a level of superpoid or obsession.
She even says that the presence of the dark color floor (acanthosis) on the cow and the front-brains indicate the probability of suffering metabolics and even pre-diabetes.
The information is maintained in a confidential way, the doctors give it written to parents, in which each of them explains the measures and changes in the lifestyle they must realize to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three major components that cause surpowers, obedience and other chronic effects: the sedentarism, which is missing daily physical activities, remaining most of the day sitting before the television and use transport methods instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the highest calorical contribution, which is the largest consumption of sucred drinks, carbon hydrates (tamales - meat feeding in the maize sheet -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of grass and proteins and genetic analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's assets would disappear cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develops aspects modified with polymers to produce a measure with a better result, independently of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signs that the path was resolved would not be necessary to repair about 200 000 cases each rain saison in the Metropolitin Zone of Mexico, warned Rafael Herra Najera, researcher of the Chimie Faculty (FQ), which ensures that if the construction process and maintenance of bituminous pathogens is adequate, the cases may be reduced or even eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on casses, organized in the International Year of Chimie, he announced that the laboratory responsible for the development of the changed aspets with polymers to produce a measure with similar characteristics to the aspet, but with a larger mechanical resistance, as well as high and temperature bass.
Mrera Najera estimated that this type of changed assets could be used in locations where the climate is extremely heavy, such as certain cities in the north of the country, to improve the cost, and therefore the training of cases.
He explained that the asphalt, the most severe part of the petrol, is a total of hydrocarbures molecules, molecules with a larger molecule, called asphaltene, and molecules with a low molecular poids, called Maltenes, which together gives his characteristics viscoletically.
The viscoelastic conduction of the aspole is in fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it is like a liquid, at 120 degrees C of its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C, it presents nearly solid status, while the steel is low, and it is added.
This means that in the streets the resistence of the assistance is not uniform and is changed during the day in accordance with environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Mexico in most of them were covered by a flexible paw, composed of six material layers, which the three lasts affect the aspet.
In the most surface layers, there is the layer of asphalt, formed by small bathed stones in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones forming the layer, signed, is cut down in asplet.
When the vehicles passe in generating efforts, this allows the forces to propagate very well in the path.
If we have been modified, these would be better, the chemical engineer.
On the layer, he said, we put a last layer called rolling layers, made in the end stone, it's, of the sable that is also bathed in the asplehold.
As this is the board in contact with the roads of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the shop board and provide access to the street.
As part of the packaging and distributing efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has a appropriate packaging and the material which it is made must be submitted.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, because these affect considerablely the reward of the staff.
When the sun moves, the water is spreading within the layer is difficult that it is so difficult, that rambles all the layers of the skin and thus causes casses.
In the training process of a case, he said, the first one is the rolling film, and only later is affected by the board of the steel, but the paint does not have immediately place, but it is a process that must be subject to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Tracker System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the training of cassis and therefore the spreader of each layer must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction to disappear the frequency of cassis training.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to invest and work on the aspet, for example, bituminous emulations, which already exist in other countries, and allows the cases easily and without use high temperatures.
What has missed the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that made Melina Ramirez Serna does not get the corner of Miss Colombia.
Valle received its title number 14 of princess.
Again, the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire to win Miss Colombia's coron.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be happy with the fact that he found himself on the podium of the guaranteers, to bring the money corner and the band who believed him as a new prince of Colombia.
With the result yesterday in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was mounted with the coron and the scepter, the department was already 14 titles of Princesse and Melina at a law of women of Valle del Cauca, who were found near the corner, but were proclaimed princes, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Alzate (1983), Olgaria Arena (1987) (1988), Blanca (1989), Maceria (1989), Pinela (1990), Diabelle (1993), Garcela (2007), Aljulania, Al-Girceta (2007)
Today the big question that many of the worlds are:
What has he missed? Because the result represents the default of a great favorite in each presentation she showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been chosen in only Queen of Police and Best Visage Jolie de Vogue, titles received by the kings Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who brought the coron of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor considered in the decision taken by the first Princess designing it is the fact that she has not convinced her answer to the question "? What was the book that marked you and why? set by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the Literaria Leamos Carreta.
This is the answer of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I think the book that marked my child is "The little prince," is a book too deep.
Now I read "Crime and Chatiment" is a universe literature book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The fire of the blood."
This answer does not ask first because of the term "Culturalizer" and secondly to not explain specifically how each citizen book had marked it.
But at the end of Melina ceremony said that she felt quiet and happy with the result "universe and wisdom, he's going to happen.
And for everyone, read a little, "The little prince" is a big book."
In the launched hypothesis, there is the way the Valle has been destroyed by favoriteism.
A journalist of Bogota instructed that, as the favorite, the unioned and the candidate who received all the preliminary prices (defie of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best artisanal costum, and the Queen Mother), "they revealed the jalousie of other candidates, stretched the Queen, and it is why she didn't light on the scene."
And it was noted in his first presentation in bath maillot at Hilton's field and his two defiled from the coroning guard.
Even if she had been sure of herself, it was noted that she had no power and energy of Magdalena and Atlantic representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como in house" programme (Come to house), the RCN Channel stated that the fact that Melina was designed by prince "trust the fact that the candidate who receives most prices during the concorrence does not receive the royal corner."
Furthermore, Valle disappeared the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not succeeded to convince the jury on its interest for social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Concours of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election, the International Judge Lucy Dotthy stated that they were looking for a woman committed in respect of the social needs of her country.
"Only the beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it is necessary to look forward to the physical and to achieve its social sensitivity, which before starting the Concours is already involved in projects," explains.
It is also specific that Valle has sinned by his faults behind her and the fibrose that was observed in his abdomen, but it is contradict, because the jury has chosen it as the candidate ' Natural Body' with the most healthy, good food and physical responsibility.
King Hernán Orosco was recognized that Melina had not the best body, that there was better, "but his fibrose problem on the abdomen, which really was not too noble for me, left him the last day."
At least the journalist Guido Hoyos, Revised Cromos, considers that the fault of Valle's candidate was the cirurgic interventions that she had gone up.
"The chirurgs are good, but Valle didn't have to do them.
His body has never been her asshole and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Concours of Beauté first returned, after the defiled in bain maillot, a serious preaching that was done yesterday, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina to not give him the good of the coron.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives him the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designing the National Concours.
However, she will pass in the story as one of the rues that, unless her low passed by Cartagena, didn't get the corner.
So it was the work of Cali's person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopist of Cali was passed in the history like a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November, a dactyloscopist of the CTI of Cali has passed in the history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano" in comparison with his digital impressions.
The seven dactyloscopists working in the local offices of the CTI, this week, was the tour of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who works for 21 years in the court investigation area.
At the beginning of his carrier, González worked in Choko municipalities, where he had to pass more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodys should be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the Valle capital and after following appropriate courses, he was specialized in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the friction paint, is to say paws and feet.
During the week of operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take with him at least three days.
Something very big expected him.
Wednesday he went to Cauca in a palmira helicopter.
He knew that he should identifie two bodys and that it was supposed that one of them was the man who leads the oldest guerrilla of the world, so we asked him to bring the card with the ten digital tickets of Guillermo Leon Sànz (the true name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team in the place of the body, he didn't recognize it by his physical aspect, because this was very different than the one he saw in the media.
He had no barbe, he was habiled as a countryman in the area, without lunettes and much bigger.
But the thiefs don't lie.
Along with a galtonian loupe, the ring, a preliminary and a lanterne, Eliazar compared the digital tickets of the body with the cards.
His eye didn't touch him: he was the Alfonso Cano.
This evening, the originary man of Puerto Tejada was the responsible one who confirmed the Ministry of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was, he was the Supreme Chief of Farc.
Research of the undertaking
For a dactyloscopist of Sijin de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopie is a exact science, without error margin, which can be critical in crime resolution.
In part of identifying the body, dactyloscopistes support research for delites such as the air and the murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many deliants have false identity cards or don't have documents.
We take their digital impressions and look for them in the database.
The researcher contained that in a case of fly he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in this place the floor had supported his hand to get out a full-force cup of smoke and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to shoot a digital pressure, but in this case we could get the entire hand and identify the deliant who had participated in various vols," remembers he.
In the case of a murder can also escape or confirm suspects.
Recently, we found a dead man, with wooden bottles around him.
Without the investigation, a parent may be suspected of crime and actually an injury on the coincidat bottle.
Even if this doesn't guarantee that he is the murderer, it's the place on the scene of crime.
A dactyloscopist of the CTI explained that it was extracted "the digital pressures of objects with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, a preliminary or a band is used to prevent them.
Immediately, undertakings are sent to Asif, the database of delikings, or to the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there are still many columbians without papers," indicates the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how we show it in the CSI television program.
As all that brilliant is not gold, everything we touch doesn't become strongly a threat.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is performed.
The "indicated" authorities in New York
Third hundreds of manifestants were buscuted before Zuccotti's place to campaign there.
A large part of people have accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integrators of the Occupe Wall Street's movement have disappeared this march by the authorities of New York trying to enter again, through a judge order, on the place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated in the air and when they tried to take a new park of the Grand Pomme.
Thursday, hundreds of manifestants were bound before the place of Zuccotti, where they wanted to access to a judge order that allows the 'indicated' to campaign again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation by buying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campaign again in the place, we will be installed in another place and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, and through the sites and peaceful demonstrations," says a portal of the movement "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indicated" to the evacuation of their camp was dedicated personally by the master of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings had issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the manifestors to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the 'indicated' have built a new park in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to Holland Tunnel, which is united by New York and New Jersey, the property of the Trinity Church.
At least one hour, they succeeded to build the place, but after the police was moved and stopped some manifestants, even if Bray could not confirm the specific number, ensure that he saw some journalists to whom we also had passed.
The organization ensures that there were hundreds of people who were installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders was moved in sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to interfere with them to the police.
At least, the place of Zuccotti - which is a private property - remains closed by waiting for the celebration of a judicial audience provided by this March during which we must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some manifestants that were moved until there were brought and distributed on that hour copies of that court order, and they also delivered it to the agents who observed the location, which caused "perhaps small affairs", indicated Bray, who declared the fact that some officials had broken the manifestors.
The judicial order prohibited the authorities to evacuate the members of the Office Wall Street or to apply the "laws published after the beginning of the employment or to interfere to the manifestants to reach access to the park with tenants or other properties they used before."
Master Bloomberg said before the pressure that, because of this judge order, the city had suspended the rebuilding of space to public and demonstrators, however, he warned that local laws do not allow them to be installed with tenders and sacks to sleep.
The Municipal Advisory defense personally the evacuation made in Zuccotti place, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and was decided because the manifestants were “functioning the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was "the place where people didn't come to protect, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do evil to others," because "also the residents received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning at the air is rebelled and showing that Bloomberg fund is more interesting to defend financial interests than the American workers," added the port-word of the movement, which accuses the mair of "not respect the freedom of expression."
The responsibilities of "Occupe Wall Street" have also indicated that they don't think to organize "grande actions" for joy in collaboration with Community organizations and syndicates to remember the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Vierge Marie in a special TV program of Noel
At Michael Buble and other celebrate Canadians, she will go out in the TV program "It's with Russell Peters Christmas" next 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement" in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", a wife of the Rock Tommy Lee and now, the activity and model will be the Vierge Marie in a special program of the Canadian TV.
The private CTV television channel announced today that Anderson, at the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other ceremony Canadians, will go out in the TV program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on the next 1 December, interpreting a very special Vierge Marie.
CTV has distributed today the images of the TV program in which Anderson, also known for the wide diffusion on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with his wife of that time, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared to be happy as the Vierge Mary, supporting a pocket that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a Canadian Canadian Comédia, which recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, would appear like Joseph.
Besides Anderson and Peters, the special CTV Noel programme also presents the Canadian Bublé song, who, at the end of March, married in Buenos Aires the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, and he himself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian for one of his concerts in New York.
Japan was back after the earth's trembling
The PIB increases 1,5% through home consumption and ends the low spiral of March's beginning
Since March, Japan's economy was paralyzed, it was still convalented after the threatened devader of the earth that became nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe of the Nipon country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government have calculated the material losses to $300,000, a couple that seems to be attached, at least the difficult context of the world.
After three consecutive trimesters of smoking, the data of Brut Inner Product between July and September have served to turn definitively the page: the PIB has increased 1,5% in relation to the previous trimester and 6% in annually.
This recorded the second trimester - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - in addition, the biggest rate of heavy rate since January to March 2010.
The recovery is, in particular, explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devoted by the trembling of the earth and the tsunami.
In fact, the enterprises increased their investments to 1,1%, in relation to the low 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed by January to March, the first reculation after six months of non-interrupted height.
However, the real stimulant of Japan's economy is not exclusively based on the keynesia impulsion that invites to use the crisis to consolidate or rebuild - infrastructures, use carences for zero cross.
Japan was especially raised by the development of home consumption, which now represents the 60% of the Japanese PIB.
This variable has increased a 1%, rated by the expenditure on vehicles, travels and divergence activities.
The stigmate of the yen
Tokyo was replaced to the internal market when the Nippon monety - became one of the "function values" chosen by investors who were the crisis of the debt in eurozone and the prevision difficulties of the United States, a privilege that was a debt in the accounts of exporting companys.
With a stronger division, products are more loved in the foreign, a serious return for a country where the economic flow line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their low results between July and September the quotation of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the EU device countries, the Government of Yoshiko Noda does not fall down.
"We need to follow the risks, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economys, the impact of Thailand inondations and the fast appreciation of the yen," reported the Secretary-General of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And actually, the perspectives are not of all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Economic Development (OCDE) stated that most Member States have submitted in September clearer signs of economic relaxation.
The indicator that prevents the inflation points of the world economy has rejected that the main powers are broken.
Because this was down four decimals to 100,4 points, in relation to 100,8 in outside.
Eurozone has even been under the average, which is located at 100 level, not bottoming eight decimals until 99,13 points.
Athens again doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
Greece continues to move into the labyrinthe that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Helenian transition Government is in place imposed by the requirements of Brussels as a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Minister, Lukas Papadimos signed yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of hundred days established in his design may be short to apply them, leader of the New Democracy Democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensures that he would not support the new outstanding measures in any case and rejected its requirement of new elections for the date provided, the 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summary of 26 October," said Papadimos when he opened a parliamentary debate tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate the employment, the reform of the training code of officers and new measures against fiscal evacuation will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaritan's message does not describe doubts on his position: "We are committed to help the transition Government, but we are not attached to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone a longer step in his pools than the EU and the FMI, the organisms that have to lock up the 8,000 million than the Athene needed with urgency, and clearly said he would not apply any letter of adjustment.
However, the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the entire reference of Papandreu, has reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not deblocate the assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the Greece's major parties does not sign a written commitment without ambigüties as soon as possible.
The Port-word of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troyka would return "trough fast" to Athene to discuss with the new Government "the needed elements to pay the sixth track" of 8,000 million, even if there is no more definitive date.
Greeks still have much to do.
The King Sofia: "This is instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen subscribes the "presentative" place of Spain in respect of this type of financial
Spanish "reaching a place in the world level in the role of Micro-finances."
The Queen Sofia reminded that the country has become the second donor of the planet in respect of this cooperation instrument which "the essence" remains in the fact that this is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for the whole humanity, based on confidence in human being."
The Queen has inaugurated yesterday the V-Est World of Microcredit in Valladolid with the sure that "no doubt" is that this type of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Objectives established by the United Nations for 2015, and "three specially, in which it has the decrease of the half of the volume of persons who live with ingress under a dollar, which is fixed by the "the only of poverty".
Spanish "continue to work" to increase the beneficiary network "in all the areas of the planet, and assume this task with "responsibility", reported the King Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Sommet, which will be extended to Judium, "the creation of new capacity and the best opportunities for the most poor and especially for women," the major benefits of these prices.
We have "was a lot of objectives" and "we're faced a lot of disasters."
The Microcredit Summary is not only considered as a form of debate, but also as the platform has from which "two base targets".
Thus, His Majesty explained that the objective is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundred million of these families have gone out of poverty in which they live now.
The impulsion in the concept of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "see the starting path for a few years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, sublineed the Queen of Sofia as a "act of justice and reconnaissance due".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "increasing idealist in the universal cause of fighting against poverty," the work that she knew since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet her paying policy on the ground.
This experience has been followed a year later by the first World Assembly in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Ivoire Court in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "to each meeting, I could construct a continued development," explained His Majesty, which has brought him last the "family chef" quality to Valladolid from the "bank of the poor."
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded its intervention by encourageing the present persons to participate in the debate and to investigate solutions to progress in combating poverty.
"Etique Imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that solidarity is a "the Ethical Imperative" for all democratic States.
In this regard, she expressed that it would be an error to vindicate cooperation with developing countries for economic prosperity, because it was a "continuous obligation".
Jimenez considered that the microcredits suspected "a serious and rich policy dedicated to the evacuation of poverty" and now "the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main cooperation lines for development.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, approved "the success" to give "the confidence" to the people "excluding all the doors" and the Mair of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of the Riva, wanted to welcome the people present in a city who "open his challenges of solidary spirit."
The CDU proposes to eliminate the European President to the universal suffering
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), Sunday 14 November, in Leipzig, was deployed without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancely and also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially established in the programme, but it was attached to the highway, especially to satisfy the military who judge the policy of the Government for too laxist in respect of the Greeks today and maybe Italians tomorrow.
The movement on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the directive, was adopted at nearly unanimity.
On 1001 delegated, only nine voted against and ten were absent.
The standing of a few minutes to which they had been right, after their interventions, Angela Merkel, then, some hours later, Wolfgang Schüble, the very European Minister of Finance, would not be sure.
The idea-mastership of the chance - and the movement - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis "not less than Europe but more than Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "new million of employees are directly depending on the euro."
For the chance, "the time has come from a perceivement in Europe."
This could be translated by changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the European area, but it could also be moved on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffering "to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the movement adopted by the congress which the inspirator is clearly Wolfgang Schüuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Vingt-Sept agree quickly on this revolution: the Great Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the hair is set.
In addition, the delegateds rejected the proposal to attach the poids of each country to the Director of the European Central Bank in accordance with the poids of each economy, which obviously returned to strengthen the poids of Germany.
The opportunity has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not been trying to win its congress on the degree of the European "petits" countries or countries in difficulty to criticize Germany.
If the movement on Europe consists of a paragraph to the importance of "the French- German friend", Angela Merkel did not call France.
Except crew.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig was in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defects of the Napoleonian Army.
What is fraud to disease?
After allocations, the UMP and the Government launch the official on the disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be March 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family locations and pronounce a talk about the subject - repeat since 2007 - fight against social frauds and assistance.
And to comply with this offence, which is part of a desire to make economies in a rigour context, but is not less an announcement of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right hand, most people want to concentrate on disease decisions.
First in a budgetary economy: the Government considers to contribute to the privacy salaries a fourth day of carence before the support of a employment stop.
Clearly, without specific enterprise agreement, a salary that falls sick would lose four days of payment, thus at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that risks to rise from wrath, but it would allow you to report 280 million euros, according to the Echos.
And who would be attached to another measure, of more symbolic ports: introducing the officials a day of carence unindemnized in the case of work (they have no carence period, against three days in private).
While these issues are discussed, most of them also refers to the thematics of frauds, which are at this time the abuse linked to work.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will rebuild," warned Xavier Bertrand at the RTL micro, Sunday 13 November.
As for other cases, the announcement effects seem to be a little disproportioned with the reality of frauds to work.
This does actually make the object of a constant and political follow-up since 2002, which most often have brought their fruit.
Frances are not more sick than in Europe.
Let's wait first on the national numbers.
According to the National Divers Security Case (CNAM), more than 237 million euros were released in 2006.
According to the Health Economic Research and Documentation Institute, the journal indentations represented in 2008 5 per cent of health expenditure, with 11,3 billion euros.
On this sum, 46% were concerned with the maternity and accidents of the work, and 54% were concerned with the diseases, or 6,2 billion euros.
And then 2,5% of the health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frances have known in average 14,5 days of work, against 17,8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A medium that covers certain excursions: another research, published in 2007 by the Monster.com carrier management site, shows that 75% of the 40 000 français soldiers asked that they had not taken any day of disease.
Another study, this time of the disease security , estimated that in 2010, 37% of the diseases were low to 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days in a month, 15% of one to three months and 11%.
When they are compared with their European neighbors, the French salaries are not more increasing than at work stops.
A long-term studie in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence tax (for health or not) in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of the disease arrests represents very little face to the work on black.
With the fraud, she's only waiting for a low wide.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002, the controls are systematic on disease decisions more than 45 days.
In 2008, over 1,5 million controls, the CNAM stated that 13% of 285,000 for long-term short delays were "injustified or too long", or 37 050 cases.
In the case of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of "injusted or unjustified" was 1,2 million or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 cases "injusted", on several million salaries with a disease stop.
A number that represents a lot of face, for example, to the work on black.
According to Mr. UMP Dominique Tian, a report on the question in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of missing a year, or more than the total cost of journal indemnities, and then more than the fraud at the last.
Papademons: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to reduce its economy.
This is what the first Ministry, Lucas Papademos, declared on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to the Government of the Union would not have enough to fulfil this task.
"To continue the renewing efforts of the economy, we need support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Government captain, who announced his first public discussion to open the debate on the vote of confidence to the Mercedes Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken in the euro area on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new Government, since the participation of the country in the euro area is in game.
Thus, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the public deficit of the country will be reduced "to the reach of 9%" of the PIB's end of the year after 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
The right refuses new exemption measures
Antonis Samaras, the chief of the right file, brought his support on the already approved measures to try out of the debt crisis but prevented that his party would not be attached to a additional extern.
"We don't vote for new measures," he said in a meeting with the Presidents of his party, the New Democracy.
It was agreed with the objectives of reduction of deficit and debt, and fighting against the but hostility of all policy that would prevent economic reprise.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner carried on economic and monetary business, which prevented that the FMI and the EU would not debt the price of 8 billion euros necessary without a write guarantee of all the parties they would support the measures provided, Antonio Samaras answered that his word was sufficient and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
A expert committee should be legalized by Utahania and Suicide assistance,
Canadians live in the decade of death, according to the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
In respect of palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative cares, and that, in addition to cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the decade of death.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Canadian Kingdom Society, which has participated six experts related to different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow the suicide assistance and the U.S.A., when this option is committed to a judicial patient to take such decision.
From the game entrance, experts quote a recent investigation of the United Economist Intelligence, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada is classified in 10th, the study notes that "the death medicalization in Canada has built a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians have not access to palliative cares, we report the experts sent by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
And although the most Canadians wanted to die in the house, 68.6% of them ended by death in the hospital.
In the whole country, this is the highest rate in Quebec, with 86% of the dead in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of the Utahania and the suicide assistance, the authors of the report have come to conclusions with the position of the Federal Government, which have already said that they would not want to change the Criminal Code on Ethanasia and its assistance.
However, according to experts, who also have revealed all countries where these approaches are legally legalized or described, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation causes abuses in the application, it is the practice of the Utahania or the suicide assistance on non-competent or non-competent persons.
In other cases, Jocelyn Downee, the report ' s teleconference, would be considered more of these disagreements in the countries where the Utahania and the assistance is not legitimate.
"The Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The suicide assistance is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downnie.
Canadians favorable to Utahania
We remember that 85% of the Canadians have already been spoken for Utahania because they believe that it would allow people to live for their suffering, according to an Angus Reid syndage in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing the Utah is not to send the message as the life of older persons or hundicated persons is less than value.
With regard to the persons who had acted assistance to suicide, sounds estimated to 41% that they should not be followed.
The situation is less clear, in respect of maintenance or deterioration to a patient, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggested that it was indicated in the Criminal Code that it would be rejected by a legal reject for which there was a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals should be formed in order to respect a reject of care in the end of life, without fear of criminal proceedings.
In respect of palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to ensure better palliative cares, and that, in addition to cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal seed, already used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it should be considered when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as the Utahania, and that it should be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reserves on the conclusions of the report of experts of the Canadian Kingdom Society.
Me Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health right, has "extreme" means the position of the signatory experts of the report, among other things because she does not limit the practice of Utahania to the disease in a terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who had been hurt of life and had more than 18 years could ask what we would help him to kill himself," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted the report yesterday.
My Dischamps also submits that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social pressure of the society.
And, "in society," he said, there are tags and contracts."
The specialist of the right of the Health Margaret Somerville also expressed a strong opposition to the conclusions of the report, which it was "manifest pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Canadian Kingdom Society, is in particular the report on the absence of abuses in certain countries where the Utahania and the suicide assistance is legally legally in the United States and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Asad to leave the power
Ladies denied a "complot"
Syria is more isolated
Parents of Bachar al-Assad have shown yesterday before the locals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures have been intensified yesterday on the Bachar Al-Assad Syria, which, with the support of Russia, reists and denied a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab Ligue, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damas while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, took place for a department of the President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab Leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "quit the power" in Syria where a fourteen citizens and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had the interest of his country, he should demission, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of the Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, near Syria, in an interview to the BBC.
For his part, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davidoglu declared that Turkish meditation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year at the Syrian regime were sold by a failure.
"Who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and can't be satisfied with them," he said, "Whoever is not in peace with their people, will not be satisfied."
The United States are welcomed by a "reforcing consensus against Assad and the Agreements of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab Ligue and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Ligue, countries such as Turkey adopt a more severe tone in the repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a portion of the State Department.
During this time, 16 citizens and at least 19 members of the regime have lost in the Deraa region in South Syria, the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other citizens have lost "the lots of shoes and pills of shoes to the worst mills in Jobar" in the Agreement city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem stated that the country was "along the end of the crisis."
In addition, he has lively responsible to the decision of the Arab Ligue to suspend Damas of his work, which is "a dangerous step."
The Syria's "not flexible," added, ensuring that "the weapon's commitments against Syria will escape."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab Ligue now studys a "Cublian Protection Mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of the Arab Organization of Human Rights, Mediterranean and military observers to the country.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also spoke favorable to send the United Nations observers to help the citizens to protect the repression of the regime, which depends on it in the Paranoia.
A new extraordinary meeting of the Ligue will be prepared tomorrow in Rabat to make a point on the implementation of the crisis outgoing plan decided on 2 November and, in particular, would be rejected by armed forces of the cities against the contemporary contemporary and the liberation of detailed manifestants.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, judged last "incorrect" the decision of the Arab Ligue, while China urged the Syrian to fulfill the crisis outgoing plan, although he was able to support sanctions against Damas.
Italy
Mount requests time for markets and sacrifices to Italy
The future ruler of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, exclaimed a little time to the markets to form its team and to implement a programme, which will contain " sacrifices" to reach the loss of credit in the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The ancient European Commissioner was discussing with the political parties yesterday before meeting the syndicates and the patron.
It should establish a relatively restricted campaign of external technology to Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputed by one of many small parliamentary groups entered into the negotiations, after meeting the President of the designed Council.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, said for his part, to expect that Mario Monti is concerned here to celebrate a vote of confidence in the Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a restricted list, in doubt of a dozen ministers, to the head of the State, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented the nervousness of boursian and obligatory markets yesterday, as they asked for time.
In the "democracy, there are specific intervals" to prepare a government and its programme, he has sublined, saying, "Surely, the markets will be patient and understanding."
His design by the President was initially held by the markets, but the concern renewed the above, particularly after an unexpected delay of the industrial production in the European area in September.
The first Ministry designed should be a team understood of technology, even if he had submitted that he would like to include "politicals".
The new government must suffer until 2013, the date of the next legislation, has been estimated.
According to the Chairman of the Chamber of the Deputy, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the trust of the Parliament from the Friday.
Mr. Monti, once entered, worked in the urgency, and in the purpose of that Italy “reforms protagonists” in Europe.
A port-word of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn submitted that "the new government himself does not change the Italian economy."
The EU, convinced that Rome would not get its objective of budgetary equality in 2013, although the outerty plans adopted these last months, requested, in particular, new risk measures.
The Italian "path of patrons" Emma Marcegagli, who will see him married, also insisted on the need to renew the economy, "for a country that has no growth can't respect the deficit settings."
Mr. Monti, reputed for its competence and its independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time transition" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolised "the serious deficit" and a "One Italy", according to the editorists.
The big unknown will be the long-term of his team.
The President Napolitano would want to disappear anticipated elections, because Italy should place this from April 2012 for 200 billion euros of state obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Irish nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wychelav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a useful detonator with a nuclear weapons, reported a specialized American NGO in the atomic risk.
The International Science and Safety Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Security (IAIAA) and other documents issued by the United Nations Agency to identify this researcher.
The AIEA has been part of his last week of serious concerns about an "possible military dimension" of the Iran nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, the AIEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades since 60 in a Soviet military centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamants by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company produced from "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would lead him to contact Iran's embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate with the Iran program from 1996 to 2002 before he returned to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA states "the strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system has been helped by the work of a stranger expert, which was not only known well this technique, but, as a Member State informed by the Agency, worked during the essential part of its carrier on this technologie within the military nuclear programme of its origin.

Anti-musulman crimes and delays have increased 50%
The crimes and delays against the Muslims have increased about 50% of 2009 to 2010, while the other racial and religious violence in the same time have leadly low or few progress, according to the FBI statistics.
According to these numbers, the total number of violations perpetrated against Muslims has passed from 107 to 160 in 2010, or 49% of increase, against 13% of the violations against Catholics, a 4% of the violations against the Jews and a global exhaustion of 14% of anti-religible crimes and delays.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very easily to 6 628 cases, including 47,3% motivated by race differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it suffers to see these crimes and delays to increase again," the organization of human rights of First human rights, "the increase of antimusulman violence is particularly significant," added the organization to a communicate.
"Human Rights First has long submitted that violence against Muslims and all forms of hate crimes must be considered as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the responsibilities of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"American Government can and must be more to attack these abuses," adds, estimating that it could be made by a improvement of police reports on the "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the American Federal Right is a heritage of the time of fighting for citizens rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to the race, the color of the pig, religion, the original and now the sexual apparence.
Twitter changes its platform and seems more to Facebook
The Micro-Blogging Twitter website introduced the lunch changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow users to observe the activities of those they follow, which makes it look like a little more than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allows to follow more readily, directly the activities of the other "Twittos", the internautes which follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula has been tested "for a small percentage of users in August" before they were divorced in the whole Sunday network, the AFP has indicated the Twitter-word port, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinct function, with a little etoterical term (RT to repeat a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user), makeing the happiness of the initiatives, opens a larger public with a more comparable manage with the larger Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users discussed about "tweets" locked on the interest of this innovation.
"It's inutile, invading, and it seems too much to Facebook," wrote @emb123.
"Activity functionality will help me to follow some of my Twitter flux," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inscription of a "or rule" budgetary in the constitution
The Government of Great Social Democracy/Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to enter into the constitution a "or rule" to reduce public deficits and thus disappear an eventually degradation by the Agency of the Sub-Austration Notes (Triple A).
It is the social democratic chance of Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision on the basis of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the criteria of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, but closely under countries' debts such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the Australia's Solutiveness was only exceeded from one corn, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest in more than each year," argumented Michael Spindelegger, the Vice-chanclier and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Austria thus requests a summit in Brussels of the Member States of the European Area of 26 October last: State and Government leaders then claimed the inscription of public deficits and return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the " German model", Germany who was the first European country to adopt such "norms".
From here 2017, the structural public deficit should reduce a year of 0,75% of the brute internal product (PIB) and, in the meaning of 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0,35% of the PIB each year, while regional States and communities should provide budgets for the equivalence.
The objective is to pass to Horizon 2020/21 the public debt under the criteria of 60% laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
One Quick
Node of a new intervention on the market of changes
The Japanese Ministry, Yoshiko Noda, prevented March that nippy authorities would be on the market if it should continue to move.
"We will interview how we have done it last time if we have a excessive volatility" in the change level of yen, Mr. Noda in Senat explained.
Mardi, the yen was not far from historical levels that have forced Japan's authorities to intervene on 31 October.
This day, Tokyo sold massively amounts against dollars in order to reduce the value of the nippone devise that came to establish a new storage record from 1945 face to the green ballet.
But the yen is regularly replaced since, dumped by investors accompanying him as a "refugee value" in those incertainty of global economic relaxing and detention crisis in Europe.
The dollar is over March under the 77 yen and the euro is down under the symbolic bar of 105 yen, nearly the levels that declared the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar costed around 120 yards and more than 160 yards.
This flammed nippone devise night to export of the archive because it reaches the cost of Made in Japan and reduces the value of income from the foreign income by Japan's firms when they convert them to national monetary.
"The Japan's fight to rebuild" since the Seisme and Tsunami of 11 March, who discovered the region of Tohoku (Nord-East), sublined Mr. Noda who fears that it doesn't kill the fragile again.
The third world economic power renewed the growth at the third trimestre - 1,5% in relation to the previous trimester - for the first time in the year, with a rebound of exports and consumption of the minas flowed by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister judged that the ion's courage was not "the fundamental economics of Japan."
The Ministry of Finances, June Azumi, called for his part the Japan Bank (BoJ), who opened a meeting of two days of its monetary policy advice, to take all possible measures to enhance the yen.
But the adjoined Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, prevented that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures," to hear that no additional monetary assessment was to wait for mercredi.
At its last end of October, the emission institution increased 5 billion yens (47 billion €) of the Tresor's goods, which makes over 55 billion yens (519 billion €) the ground of the quantities that it provides for the achievements of various financial tickets to enter the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
the taxes are smoking, the bourses are flanching
The risk of concentration of the crisis of my debt is always the European index.
Despite the design of new Government Leaders in Greece and Italy and the best growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of fragilizered countries continue their assessment.
The European Bourses are still concerned for the stability of the euro area, a little more in negative territory, this March 15 November.
In Paris, at 10:00, the CAC 40 lost 1,4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Francfort is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new tensions on the costs of the euro area in difficult cases, action markets throughout the world continue to reach a part of their recent guarantees."
"The investors, nervous, are only known for the risk of countion, " explains Terry Pratt, institutional court in IG Markets, cited by the Reuters agent.
The Tokyo Bourse closed down of 0,7%, suffering the renewed fears of the market intervenants on the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
"Japanese, as the rest of the world, has the eyes looking on Europe and changes will continue in a straight variations corner so that the investors will not have evidence that the situation is established ", named Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management Management.
This reward of concerns on the future of the European Area penalized the unique monetary, which continues to get its wedding tomorrow.
The euro is developed at its lower level for a month and half.
At 10h, the European advice is $1,3570, in response to 0.4%.
According to the courts, she returned after the part of the chance of Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in the lunch congress, has adopted a move in particular the possibility for a country in difficulty to go out of the euro area without to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish levels beyond 6%
Italia and Spain are at very careful levels.
This morning, the reward of Italian obligations at 10 years has 6,85%, the Spanish titles of the same maturity 6,2%.
These tensions on the interests of the Southern countries, but also in France, continue to eat the fears of the intervenants.
The chief of the future Government of Italian Mario Monti urged the time to the markets to restore the situation in Italy, mischief of asphyxie by its debts.
The New Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, he said that the implementation of decisions taken in the euro area on 27 October would be the " main task" of his government.
Spain is found in the market view line, while it is at Sunday legal elections in the country.
The exchange of taxes ("expanded ") between the obligations to 10 years of Germany and Spain has reached a new more higher history.
In the expectation of the euro area growth numbers
Statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0,4% to the third trimester, or a bit better than 0,3% expected by the consumption of minas.
However, the Insee reviewed the number of the second trimester, with a review of 0,1% of the brute internal product (PIB) instead of a stagnation.
And it's actually the fourth who's worried about the most economists.
Germany, on its side, recorded a growth of 0,5% in the same period.
A first estimate for the whole euro area is expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has been carried out against the risk of a new reception.
Energy policy:
the facts must import it on dogs
If it is a subject that can not be treated from short-term considerations or under emotion, it is well the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity influence directly on the achievement and competitivity of enterprises.
It is healthy that a electoral advantage is the opportunity to think about such kinds and the place where the nuclear is.
The debate will be fruitful only if it is exploring all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
Frances should base their opinion on objective facts, racial data.
While we are seven billion of human beings on the planet, the demographic evolution will take a duplicate of the demand of electricity from here to 2050, less a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
In the same time, the railway of fossil resources will be needed to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperial need to reduce gas emissions in effect in order to fight the climate disorder, a loss of environmental debate.
Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renew the nuclear.
This is not the case of Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source of replacement can be replaced, nor from Switzerland, which only feels to build the centres of the last generation.
In contrast, the Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the Switzerland, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, so that they continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by receiving the construction of a central interrupted after the accident of Three Mille Island.
If the German model, achieved on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as a example, the reality contrasts the conversation.
Berlin's choice will be translated by the refrigeration of the electricity price, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased gas resource, in particular from Russia, a good of CO2 emissions introduced by the construction of central gas and carbon.
In a few months, the whole of these fake effects are already feeling.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
The European Europe of the Eolian, which takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest carbon and gas users of the meaning of the wind intermittency; whereas its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the average of Europe.
In contrast, through the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors buy a higher electricity factor of 40% of the French mines.
While in a global economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitivity and a gain of industry maintenance on the national territory, French companies benefit from the least love of Europe.
In fact, every significant reduction of the nuclear part would generate a strong height of the price of electricity, which would illusorize the beautiful statements on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of the achievement of the power.
A price that a large majority of Frances refuses to pay, while they do not demonstrate principle opposition to this energy, they show it.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has allowed to build a industrial field of 125 000 direct employment and 410 000 industry employment.
For the exporting force, it introduces a specialized PME galaxy on international markets and makes them very unlocalized employment creatures.
If France had decided to get out of the nuclear, it would be offering a lot of these PMEs by reducing 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical would a EPR designed to work for sixty years while the decline of his manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to resolve the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no source of production of wonderful electricity, not more than the diabolic.
Development by the Agricultural Development of Scientific CO2, Nuclear and Renewable Solutions Area is witnessing the complementaryness of the energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest security level is a absolute imperative.
We have in France a security Authority that exercises a transparency and transparency control on existing centres like on the chain of Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionality is recognized, are living from the same obsession of security.
In a half century, nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, is involved in normal operating conditions; it is remained without human and environmental consequences.
In Tchernobyl, the concept of the reactor and impersonal human offences have provoked the drame.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results of two natural catastrophes of a wide breeding without precepts who caused the death of ten thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the teachings of this accident, as it did for the two previous.
The EPR presents a concept that can retain such phenomenon to the workshops between security authorities, explorers and French and German constructions.
While it is considered by all electronic wishes to build a central, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF to leave their free path to achieve the leadership in the unconfrontable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy bucket for our country, but it would be irresponsable to leave emotion, dogs and detailed workers to dominate a detailed debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is it a load or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles - aggregation of policy, judges and administrative services under the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the autoproclaimed state of "the country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harvest that the foreign students who have made the present, the Minister of the Interior (lire Liberation of 23 May) preaching the past that France "not needs foreign talents, massions and restaurants."
But it is only rarely analysed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
Right, you have been given by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900000 chambers should not be a problem in a country that understands about 2 million immigrated workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "not can take all the misure of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by pool flow hordes was divided to the left as right.
For the two borders, immigrants are carried out as a charge for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is at the level of generosity that it will lead to the immigrants.
In its programme, Francois Holland can sing banalities, indicating that the co-development will allow us to resolve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a charge, a problem, may be paid electorally, but it is very cost.
As the Economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remember in a recent work, synthesising the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a large consensus between specialists on the positive impact of migration flux on economic growth, salaries and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting anemia immigration growth and night to the employment.
The fears regarding the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these risks to replace national employees, particularly the small qualitative pressure, exercising a low pressure on their salaries.
But the experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than replaced by national salaries, exercising the essential of the measures in employment sectors.
Immigrants work in non-quality sectors that do not take national salaries, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the offer of work.
A positive effect on the salaries
In the same way, a chirurg will be bad to work in a country who knows anesthestic penalty, these complementarities between national and migrants make that immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and the employment of nationals.
John Peri thus calculated that a 1% of the migration flux increases between 0.6 and 0.9% of the real salary long-term.
And it does not take account of the fact that the diversity of the immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (for the proportion of immigrants naturalized among the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been based by immigrants).
The migrants are also net contributors of social systems, in average of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The World Working Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant in 30 years will bring a net (recepts less expenses) of 150000 euros to the average public budgets on its whole life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, in the beginning of the mandate, to go to search the missing growth points with the dents.
The issued dents, served to dissuave immigrants, have been the exact effect inverse.
Europe has invented the democracy, remaining to think of the European Democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a good fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented him in Athens over two thousand years, has known the tragedies of the Greece, the totalitarists, the Holocaust, the Goulag, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the Colonels in Greece.
Some could believe that it would be enough, so that the triomphate democracy definitively of his enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way that it is.
We know, from Napoleon "the Petit" he was there with a thought facility.
The universal suffering, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can even be "oppressed instrument" as the Republican Philosophe Ethanna Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, a separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis of Europe we live is an economic crisis, but it is the same and first a crisis of political and democracy.
The Greek Referendum's real failure will have the value of double revealer: the need of a powerful return of the policy, but also the feeling that it is incompatible with its incompatibility.
This ambivalence must be considered to be exceeded.
The truth is that the democratic battle lines have been moved today, and, for many of them, the Republican soldiers have no longer in the good direction.
We have nothing to win to require a success of national referendums, organized on the basis of needs and distributed orders.
A white-seeing at the absolute European monarch or a foot-shirt in the empty of the nationalist replies: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want cuts, but a common, full right, serin and continually, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, - we would not know more where to stop the enumeration - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe that is attached to market diktates and notification agents, which have been able to achieve its immuneness and solidarity failure.
This is the whole Europe that is humbled on the international scene.
We are concerned about submarination transfers to Europe - but it is all Europe who lost its sovereignty, and with each of its nations.
The urgency is to reduce popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together that the Europeans can reduce their debts, free from markets and prepare the future in investment.
The exit of the crisis will submit decisions to the European level that cannot be taken without a total democratic legislation, unless it is certain to lead us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delors, all today the European Economic Government is proclaimed.
Call it.
But thinking that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lives like citizens, would be a new fool and a new imprisonment.
We must take a new step of the European Construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, he failed the "fair" of the Republicans.
The Revolution in interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe on the economic plan.
This can only be made by building a more democratic Europe on the political plan, a real European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"No contact" cards are generalised
The world room of the puce card opens marty at Villepinte, near Paris, in a optimist climate.
In 2011, it should actually be achieved on a 11% of the world's carts to microprocessor (bank card, phone with SIM card...), over 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most portoral segment is the technology without contact that allows you to pay common transports or regulate its achievements by just approaching a reader's map.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold through the world, against 320 million a year later!
Their part should continue to progress in 2012 (580 million waiting units) and represent about 10% of the global market of the card (6,925 million cards).
Long-term training of Asia-Pacific region, Europe wins the land for the payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped from this functionality and 75,000 payment ends are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been developed.
But the big surfaces put duplicates.
This year Card has ejected 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To pass to higher speed, the banks need to drive their clients.
"The two major French institutions have been committed to discuss the future systematically to their customers of bank cards equipped for no contact," announce Gerard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment per mobile
But this is only the first step to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A few devices are now equipped from NFC (Near Field Communication) to enhance transactions.
"They have taken the late."
"But they should finally know a real extorsion in the next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take their faces.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a December to June to Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped from an equipment that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, she also said yesterday, prepared the market of a offer that allows its clients to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist face is exceeding
Paris is concerned between al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram section.
A long-term date, the links between the terrorist al-Qaida group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section Boko Haram are confirmed.
Wednesday, the Algerian Vice- Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messael, even said that Alger had then "acquired certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and information reports show that there is well cooperation," he explained without more precisely.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the rapt of two French in Niger in the last January would have placed on the day of passengers.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by near Aqmi, Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory should be killed on the next day as many of their advisors during a operation launched by the French special forces.
In the cases of the intervention, French and nigerian investigators had to find several telephones that were terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis of the passengers east to several speakers based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in researchers: a mine to a Nigeria who was a long-term city in Maidguuri, a city of the north of Nigeria, the Berceau of Boko Haram, and the other to Aqmi and the section.
"It's an advance, but it is necessary to expect more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know since years that the beneficial section of external financial and intellectual support and that it shows more active," the Times Conle Amuwo, a nigerian researcher.
In the past months, these "approval" had been more significant in the evolution and talks of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which then implied the review of camacases or explosives of more complex and the same fact that they used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning by Washington, then pressed Abuja to take account of the problems made by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have considered the group as a community of small interests.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidguuri around a museum, a fundamental school and an immanist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means in Haussa "Occidental education is a sin" - predicts the establishment of a Islamic Emirate in the north Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association knows a quick success.
It is political and requires a strict respect of the charia, while its military men are attached to combat against the central government.
These lasts appear first to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's military officers showed particularly active, multiplying attacks against the Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, like his habitude, without noise.
The army invested the city, we count 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, lived, was killed in prison.
Then the section will radyize and leave its fifths from the north.
At the last Sunday, she advertises awareness that makes 80 dead in Jose, and then another in Abuja.
In June, it's still in Abuja that Boko Haram takes the police QG in a suitable attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local seats will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would ship from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, then concerns all security specialists.
As Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalians of Al-Chebab operated in Kenya, Boko Haram appeared as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, when an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alan Juppé was held against Boko Haram and said "to share all information" .
The world according to the Republican candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry replies to simply and unconsciousness.
A American, who is a crisis, can it handle a complex world with simple ideas, seen simply?
To listen to the Republican candidates, electors could believe it.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others multiply tonitruous statements and cuts on stranger policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on the Iran, on the help of Israel, the slogans - often not stated - they were.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the course at the name of "Grand Old Party", threatened to train the Chineses before the WHO and to put them "for manipulation of their monkey," a portory theme in an American examinated by the migration of all their industries to Asia.
So much if this should imply the declaration of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, an ex-ambassader in China in Obama and only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to be amazed at an attitude that "flatte" emotions.
He called to a muscle, but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stays in the depths of the summers, remains inadmissible.
To Reagan Image
Romney also promised military flags on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, he's fanfare."
"If Obama is real, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama to fail his obligations in respect of this partner.
Inspector Herman Cain, the second candidate is the best placed, shows him how a remarkable disorder of the documents is.
Recently, he called to contrary the Chinese military threat because Pekin "seek to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China deserves the military atom since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to smoke against Iran, said, how ready he was to attach the American army to Mexico against drug carts.
The torture against the presumed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recognized by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a weakness in foreign policy.
The adversaries of the current president replies that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They remember that Obama himself was a Amateur and he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They inquire with reason about the failure of his native dialogue with Iran, on the department too precipite of the "boys" of Iraq, on its territorys in Libya, collecting him a low label.
But the attack isn't so late.
The population judges more positively the national security budget of Obama, which removed Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she dealt with military interventions that lead to the license.
And, in doubt that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama struck more justly.
North Stream, New Ross Gas in Europe
The North Stream Gashood, directly linking West Europe to Russia throughout the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million families.
Gazprom, the Russian gaser gender, wanted to celebrate the event with exclamation.
More than 500 invitations whose four rulers of State and Government have participated, last March, on the borders of Baltic, between orchester and buffet final, in the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gazoduc that directly reaches, under the sea, Russia in Germany.
Similarly, the German chance of Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the first French Minister of Francois Fillon and its homologation of the Netherlands-Bas Mark Ruttes have turned together the volant of the valve that commands the Russian gas in the East-European network.
With this new gazoduc, 27.5 billion cubes of Russian gas gas will be achieved each year in West Europe by 1 224 km from the region of Saint-Petersburg to the country of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed in the end of 2012, allowing to deliver 55 billion cubes of gas, or the equivalent of all French consumption.
And it is already called the possibility to build one third on the same parking.
For Gazprom, the end in time and time of this great chantier has a victory air.
The project was strengthened by Poland and Baltes countries.
The North Stream will actually allow gas directly to Germany, eviting all earthly pass through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to pain on Russia, asking to close the access to the west-European markets.
At the strongest debate, Varsovie had no happiness to compare the North Stream with a "new Swiss German agreement ", referring to the relationship between Hitler and Staline to occupate Poland in 1939.
That means if the subject is politically sensitive.
The Eastern Europe, bringing its support to this Russian project, has won a greater security of its approvals.
But it's in the price of an energy-energy Europe, since the project has created a bit between Eastern and Eastern Europeans.
In five years, Russia has triumphed his view of a direct cohesion between Russia and the rich west countries, strongly gas consumers, and the gisms are declined.
"This gazoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it's a new art that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon, increasing this gas, showing how great gas contracts are as political and economic.
All this explains the wide smooths shown by the managers of Gazprom, present in Lubmin at the gas point.
Building of this gazode is also a technical exploit.
The submarine tube is gained by beton to protect it against the ships' anchor.
He reposes on the ground of the sea, at the middle of 200 m.
In order to build it, he failed to lose fields of mines given by the Second World War.
"A hundred has to be removed or destroyed, by precaution," says Jens Müller, Port-word of the North Stream Society.
It also failed to multiply the measures to protect the fat and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent, worried as 242 tours Eiffel, which doesn't interrupt on all its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was provided in Sweden, but the responsibility of the project renewed it while the Sweden had no longer desire to see a Russian State company to establish permanently on the width of their costs.
"In the case of aeroplane, we'll stop the gas transition at least a minute," noted Jens Müller.
In the case of escape, the gas contained in the gas is therefore explored in the air.
But this case is not probable to be judged by the constructioners who have proposed the sudden to know a fugitive every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the gasoc status is ensuring by a submarine robot, trained by a ship, for external observation, and by a device that runs within the gasoc.
From the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, width of a diameter, and it is cut by the gas.
At the arrival, after three days of full journey at the speed of 3 meters second, he provides specific information on the events of the metal deformation.
The gazoduc was designed to work for fifty years without have to go up the reparation.
The gas circulation is just ensuring by pressure.
It's 200 bars from the department, and from 100 to the arrival.
Five companies have their strength to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parts.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Netherlands Gasunia and the French GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called North Stream, loaded to build and operate the gazoduc.
She has her seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then declared this company for twenty years renewable, the total of gas transport capacity.
" Gazprom pays for the total capacity, which is the quantity of actually transported gas ", notes Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gasoc has been assessed by actors and at 70% by banking prices.
The total cost of work should be achieved at 7,4 billion euro for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has gone to 240 million.
But minority actions are sure to return to their costs, since only Gazprom takes risk.
The gasoduc is the baltic in Lubmin, on a sample literary plant of pins.
Valves, high of 4,5 meters, forming the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the specificity of the gas that comes before it is transferred into German gases.
Since March, this terminal received a million of Russian gas cubes every hour past.
In full capacity, these will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a mark.
It was created for a 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wanted to reward the good of the writer.
He has a parfum of adventures, of times past to write to the light of a boogie.
The Moleskine book is easily recognised, with its black rectangulary covering, its elastic, his sheets of a white cutting color, as old by time.
However, the Moleskine book as we know him today is born in 1997.
The Italian Mode Mode, based on Milan, decides at the time to launch a designed but separated notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is launched from the launch of the new product.
The library is inspired by an ancient production technology, the skin skin moul (flow) that draws a vernis coton used to cover banks, for example.
This kind of boat was very taken by writers and travelers.
" Moleskine gave up a old and forgotten object, which was an icon of pre-guarders, until the XX and the century, ", reported Mary Sebregondi, being responsible for the mark in Mode Mode.
The success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, the vessels increased 26% to set up to 12,7 million exchanges.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3000 carts were designed.
Moleskine passes over the Italian borders and exports in 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the accommodator, because the notebook also deserves the businessman and the student and professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolites, opening spirit and cultured.
The small Italian company, which counted 12 employed at its beginning, takes at about 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small center-ville boots and put her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new write requirement, unless the e-mail writer, explains Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural signature includes the development of Moleskine: recently, the mark has launched a "Reverse" exposition where architects or artists expose their own letter.
In August, she also launched a covering in leopard, at the time of the Festival of the Locarno film.
Providing its success and its cultural aircraft, Moleskine has differentiated its products: sacks, agenda, styles, computer woods... The mark is described on all support game.
A success that has been achieved: at August 2006, Mode Mode has been purchased by the SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writeing a new page in the Moleskine history.
Why is the rating of employees who have been able to be so high?
At least 19% of the disastered persons are searching for a work.
The 15th week for the employment of the employees is open today.
Despite a public volontary policy established in 2005, the rate of disastered persons is twice higher than the average: 19%, against 9% of the population.
Decouraging?
"No, sublines Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the work of the employees."
" Progress since 15 years are significant. "
"In the time, the rate of rate was not two but three times higher."
"It's still much to do."
It is necessary to say that for the hazard coopers, the obstacles remain a lot before accessing to the employment.
They are older: 37% have more than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a lot of high quality level: 80% do not have the bac and at 2.3 million students of higher education, only 10 000 are cut off.
Finally, the long-term smoking is very extended: 53% for the hacked, against 38% in average.
Bref, as soon as criteria that singlely fulfill the return to the employment, and who " constitute the weight of the problem ", according to Christian Grapin, Director general of Tremplin, a association created in 1992 to help the enterprises to recruit the hacked workers.
That's for targets.
The non-dit remains, the mentality that develops, of course, but too late.
A study held in April by the IMS-Introducation Association for the City indicated that the managers asked " have a lower knowledge level of handicap ", with a " super-representation of persons in ruling chain, psychic or intellectual deficiency " .
The results, private companies of more than 20 salaries are still far from achievement of the employment objective of 6% of employees, established in a law of 1987.
The last known numbers from 2008 are a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now around 3%," indicated Peter Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization loaded to collect the contributions of enterprises that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed " structures, as the versed quotes, decreased between 2007 and 2011, over 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
" The Act of 2005, who increased contributions, has made a strong pressure on the business, explains Peter Blanc. "
"But this improvement also translated a true conscience, in particular in the large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 salary institutions work against 82% of 100 to 199 salary companies.
Hazard: "What a pleasure"
Before the Bleus March night (2045) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens didn't hide the pleasure that they proceed this friendly match.
We're not going to write until there was conviction between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting at the street of the auditorium of the state of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace well.
Five months after the guest of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian electoral only has an elops to do about it.
"I am very happy of Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward," assure the Lillois on his side.
With regard to the contrast between its club offers and election, "Is it all, if it is justified."
"In Lille, I'm all the year, that's not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Meaning against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Dennis for finally "brilller".
But not forget the notation of "playing".
Bleus, he encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," he said.
Instead, this participates to strengthen the "particular" character of this meeting.
As soon as in the face, "It's Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he's cut off.
"We're all cross up at the hour."
"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure."
With Bonhomie, Leekens called for his part from the "fornication".
"First" to discuss "a match of the gala."
"First" also to constat - in quality of "voins" - that France has become a very high level team a little more than one year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc made a toner work," he threatened.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technology will be well part of the air with the Blues directions... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small documents become big," he sublined.
"We're training to build something, players are ambitiative, they're hungry."
"You're going to take account of the next matches." This is against France included.
Portuguese very confident
The Portuguese of Paul Bento, with many optimists, encompasses his bargain back to Bosnia (22:00), this morning in Lisbon.
In the way, the two teams were missing realism.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, in particular, a happy country. "
Paul Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt, the Election, which is in the manufacturers since September 2010, will be qualified for Euro 2012.
Portuguese is actually at 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and an enemy, Bosnia, to dealing.
When the match goes (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it would appear that the games are not done.
Portuguese has dominated the part for more than one hour, of course, but it was impossible to mark this objective so precious, which would have submitted it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we've not marked objectives outside."
But at home, in their light Stade of the Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, before a public that should be also smoking there, even if the part is clearly announced " very serious ", said an optimist but brilliant Bento.
"We are waiting for a very serious match, but we are actually convinced that we can take it up," said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% of chances to be in Euro 2012," even related to the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The Bosnia's Friday report has obtained the Portuguese to mark and win.
Nobody can suffer to Bosnia, who also needs to mark.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we have not marked outside, "ordered Bento.
"We're going to play against a team who has many technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
Like Zenika, the Portuguese will have the intention to introduce a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to not " not give them the time to think."
A good idea, in order to show realists, this time.
