Parliament has not supported a new Timothy's freedom.
The Ukrainian Parliament has rejected the proposal to abort in the framework of the Court of Criminal Act, on the basis of which Julia Timošenk was condemned.
The amendment that would open the way to deliver the prisoner's expressions, the messengers refused to read the second reading proposal for the reduction of crimes for economic decline.
The Germany was condemned in October for seven years of prison to conclude an inadequate agreement with Russia on the purchase of the country.
The judgment is not authorised, the revocation of the jurisdiction has the court to act in prosince.
The Timothy marks the judgment on a political measure of the regime, the subsequence of the court's accusation has chosen the process and the Confederate.
The proposal that the paragraph 365 of the Criminal Court falls from the basis of which the expressor was judged was supported by voting 147 messengers.
He needed 226 voices to approval.
Libya's victory
Libia's freedom, or Libya's rebel, has already been raised.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in a unknown place in the wilderness and without him is after the war.
It's still to define the wind.
As it is in the country normal, in the choices of the islamism, it's about death or radically.
The transitional national Council has been announced to the normal law of the Sharia, and we have already a certain presentation on it.
Libia will become a country without criminality, because the hands are cut off for the worst.
Women can forget emancipation, accidents from faith waiting for transport and similar.
Instead of the director's person, the company who resides from the supply of the rocks will join the core.
It's gonna be a order that we can't imagine, and we wouldn't want to.
Only our way of life is not even the only, neither objectively best, and it would not be the most important to change to the Libyans mentioned.
In fact, the Islamic battlemans have taken thanks to the unbelievers of dogs.
Sorry, it is only that NATO has not guided a general of America, except Alah, whose size in each submitted principle.
So when they are looking for a victory in Libya, western is not like them.
We joined the shoes, served to Islam, and our policies saved political relationships in the person of the director, and it would not be able to benefit.
After the bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq of Libya, we don't obtain military experiences.
It's a problem with the "Christians".
But will they have a low companie for the music of the Libia's black gold?
They may not be enough, and the west will finally be able to condemn the unseen human rights.
So if we don't pronounce the law of the law of the Share.
It's starting a new crisis.

Fotbal representation was the most difficult task of the session!
In the Black Mountain and thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful gates of Peter Jirač wind 1:0.
The Czech photoball and with a large port of happiness in the second half of the time has gained the luxury smoking from home visits and will not be mistaken on the European championate.
IHNED.this followed the procedure excuses in detail reporters.
Nevertheless there's no respiration in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Chess representation and thanks to the home dead in the end, the great Czech and the Herd of Jiraczk wind in Black Mountain 1:0 and celebrates progress on the Europe's mystery.

The pressure of the household photobasts and that's why in the first half wasn't coming, the long copies for the protection of that chess defense rejected exactly.
Iran students are ready to die for a nuclear programme of their country.
They created living ships
Some hundred high schools have created living ships around a nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express the support of the nuclear programme of their country before possible Israel's attack.
Students prayed in the south before the object and then called the death of the United States and Israel.
A number of hundred students of university in Iran Isfahann have created in a bunch of living ships around the Izpahan nuclear technology center in which uran is processed.
They show that they are ready to protect the nuclear programme of their own country.
The International Agency for Atom Energy (MAAE) in his recent report concluded that Iran had not stopped to force the nuclear weapons.
The potential attack on the Iranian nuclear equipment is called in Israel.
Students prayed and then called the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack, it would be the most important to protect the Iran nuclear program, in accordance with the Israeli pressure, except the Isfaana Central Agency, also the device in Natanzu, where uran is covered.
Feeder of the kids: no dinner and dinner
More than the third children in 9 to 13 years have problems with superstition, and the overridge has 9 per cent of schools and parents are 5 per cent of children.
Thus, most children are departing from the family with an unhealous lifestyle as he showed the current investigation.
It is again shown how important it is for health development of humans in which grows, and the models that are circumstances.
For example, on the tables with children’s beauty are shown to half more than in families with normal weights.
The deleted borders had a day before the investigation linked to the light action named Obesita was not a agreement more than 19% of the officers.
In the families of adults, there is also no normal sport, however, the majority of the families of today’s schools - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents were at least one week to find time for a active move.
Research between 900 children
The investigation was conducted at the end of the lonely school year, and there was 900 children from the basic schools from the whole Czech.
It was the second yearly Action of Obezita is not an agreement that supports the Universal Health and the Unilever company.
In the project, more than 12 thousand schools from 4 to 8.
The right strengthening and achievement of the movement in the family is therefore one of certain factors that makes dramatically the number of children with respect or even obsession.
"Only half of the questions, for example, she said that she had five times on day in the field of dinner-of-sheed-sheed-sheat, which is one of the basic provisions of the right consumption," says one of the results of the investigation.
Without lunch and evening
Officers notify that health development is essential and related details, between which a regular time of family dinner is required.
In Germany, only 23 percent of school families are eaten in the same time.
In most families, everybody eat himself.
And the worst was found that in the decade of house wasn't worried.
The Sunday is therefore the basis of the correct day of the summer.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of parent children with many often consume non-healous borders.
If each - without the weight - drinks every day sweet limonad (70%).
In fact, more than 40% of the children asked, however, the results were less than half - 15 percent of their parents.
Take your food
Another part of the investigation allowed the kids (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to meet themselves from the possibilities offered by the proper foodshop in accordance with their own poverty and their own opinion.
"The health preferences of the Children in the age of 12 to 15 have healthy lives far away to the ideal."
In the middle of their favorite foods, they are very damned, massive and famous foods.
"Alarming is particularly a great delay of famous limonad," refers to the final report to the investigation.
To lunch as the main food was gathered in a steel over the treatment.
But the children practically didn't want lushery and lowerly they were also cutting fish and southern green foods.
Health struggle
Research also showed that children wanted to improve their sustainable reviews if they receive correct information.
"In the control group of participants to the investigators who have concluded the public proposal of Obesita is not an agreement, the preference of the directive to the principles of health consumption has been made in the results of the project.
The market was, for example, in the beauty limonates, where the children would begin to give the presence of normal water.
Children also are also more frequently stripped in the questionnaire and fish as the main food of the day, and would be limited to sweet food and tickets.
Stylelist must also be a good psychologist, aware of the profile
In the executive article about how to learn stylist, I was so surprised that it was a lot of time for officers.
I didn't know what to follow.
Three profiles from the campaign, clothing of problems and seminars about how it goes to the place.
And it'll be bigger.
Besides final tests, more information and practical tasks expect us.
And even when the curse ends every Sabbath, and they don't do it, it's really "stopped."
This time, we've been with Director Allenca (in the course is not the only boy), how to dress a woman who doesn't have a perfect consistent position.
And that's the most overwhelming.
Somebody's got a short kid, somebody's got a kid's position without a regular crown, and someone's guessing again.
The style must know how the opts to decrease the wide frames, spread the ring, or add the needed crowns.
We got a kind of kind like Jennifer Lopez's woman, so greater puzzle and sides and a smooth path, a standing nicely, and also not to touch a woman too excited.
For example, if it's a difference between the pair and the sides, it's not really sitting in suck or calhotes, then it's gonna be paid to take up at least one of such a piece of peace.
You won't deserve, because perfectly falling clothes are not paying.
In peace sucks you will feel much better than in those who are unfortunately moved to you, distant, and similar.
The boy's position can be able to take a clothes with rings, applications, higher or choices.
Of course, such information and types of position are much, so I like that I have all weeks to make all the information in my head.
And I'm so afraid that, in view of the assigned home job, it's the same.
Each of the curses received a classified celebrite that has to imagine two outfits: day and evening.
We have to take care of the current view, the modem style given personality and type of position.
I'll be "wheat" Miranda Kerro, maybe you know her from the campaign of Victoria's Secret.
In the spirit, I am personally better for me than that Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who took about a hundred kilos in the last time (come, please, in the surprise), or a young Selena Gomez.
We need to explore the records of the magazines or search on the Internet and print and get the graphics processed.
Moodboard, as it says to the whole result, then our personal style and relationship with the graphical creation.
Thinking also about the graphical styling page is important.
The style is therefore not only physical, but also creates such product pages in the magazines (in particular task, for example boxes, boxes.)
He told us the stylist and the proposer Mario Camennick.
But it's on week.
The style list must have a global view
The Saturday preview on types of setting had only three hosts from the office.
Stylelist Honza Poor, moderate proposer Jakub Polanka and model photograph Ben Rencz.
Jacob reminded us that the model is illusus and the stylist should use it.
And the shock stylist can work with one kitchen of clothes differently.
Variable is in this case key.
So, such a trenchcoat (or if you want to originally tranchcoat) can be taken classically through rings and trico as a plot, but you can also clothe it on the hot body, around the ships and photograph as a clothes.
Or it's enough to get out of hands or hairs, and it's now the whole look looking looks different.
"Play with it," he raised up.
But I appreciated the following advice, "You need to know perfectly the rules."
"You can start breaking it," Jacob said.
Finally, I'm sure why we're going to get all the teachings that we're combined to what, why, if we're going to see something else in the modem magazines.
I don't care about the surveys.
Thanks to Ben's photograph again I know that the stylist needs to be prepared for more than how much it's going to photograph them.
So in the fashion story that will have ten pages (when ten outfits), I have to be prepared for at least 15.
And also that on the picture of the clothing looks like and works in combination with other lecks entirely different than in reality.
So we have to calculate the exhibition.
That image and style makes low until half of success, Honza Poor confirmed us.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not just a wonderful song, but image and marketing of it made a world star.
There is still access to use of stylist service in the Czech.
And the famous faces of her lecks think to be restless (but it's enough that I know something, as I look at it, is a secure).
And if somebody leaves to create styling from us, then we're going to count with that, with great probability, he shows us a total (minder) size than he really has.
Then it's not staying to go google and to find if the bulvarer didn't write that the cleabrite was cut off/hushing and similar.
Honza and Mario put us on the heart on the week, that the stylist doesn't suffice to orientate himself in the way and to put outfit.
In his work, he communicates in particular with people who dress, and it is important to be a good psychology.
It's worth to cut off people, don't be courageous, stay after your opinion.
"If you have a manager to cut it up and fill it for a good cup, you can't cut it out all the board and say, God, it's a weird."
"See at least a few things you honor and recommend what they're going to do," said Mario.
He also showed us specifically what everything has to contain such a "place" or a box on the box.
It's the one you're going to roll around the pass and you have all the needed properties.
In addition to clear things, such as nicks, war on chlors or locks, there are also silon nits (which stylist makes the photographing of products such as boxes or clouds), special clips that we embrace the ground of clothing, if greater (wheel or other form is not allowed), they would have cut off clothes or skin.
To not just listen, but also some practically tried, we learned how to follow the bottles.
And on the photographing in the air, where it's equal to the plane, it's gonna be able to smoke, then outside.
And then we're kidding, and we're lying.
We don't have to touch the weddings, and we don't have to touch them.
So, it's really really needed to be disappointed.
Mario rejoiced me when my creation was blessed without the expenditure.
It's really not my friend.
It's just a little bit of what we've heard about the second weekly continuing curse.
It's beginning to be a more clearer thing that a styling at the professional level really is not a round saddle to say whoever wants what you want.
In Need for Speed: The Run is leading for all America.
Recense
Originally, the non-profit vehicle has been changed for the series of restrictive straight errors in the rutin-margin route to the shoes.
Ambici has been fulfilled in a significant way, but it's nothing valid if nobody was clearly wanted to do anything more.
New part with The Run's subtitle was built before a high expectation.
He promised that the aircraft Need for Speed was moved again to the new direction and from the playable show was as a game that would not be in the office of the office of action.
We were also convinced how the inserted passy in which the main hero will go out of the car and walk after their own.
As the NFS series is normal, many are a little different result than we expected.
They are potentially able to arcade commitments, but the entire entire entirely falls down a few remaining errors that appear in the series for a few years ago.
So it's actually not a mistake, but often shows how unbelievable the ability of developers.
Good group starts very well.
You are mentioned in the story of which the chief hero Jack has certain problems of personal character and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal shipment, such as American.
You're going to call on the west side of San Francisco and your task is to get it first to New York.
Think with her is a few interesting elements.
The trace is divided by ten steps, and then more than fifty rates.
It indicates that each shipment is on other traits and the data stages are set in various, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
The man doesn't even feel that the game is still the same.
Some of the environment are also very nice to view, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous series.
So it's nothing worldwide.
But, for instance, the ship is desolate, a strange country or high in the hidden mountains are very pleased.
Moreover, the ships are a time from the time of the conservation of some non-type elements.
In the wilderness, for example, you will help to a single ball that is significantly reducing the visibility.
Instead of this, you have to give attention again in the mountains that you don't shoot the lake.
In this way, they are very well designed by themselves.
They're just a few types, but it's enough.
You're trying to prevent the required number of companies (in basic classic charges), then you get time (classical supply with feet) and then wait for you with a single supply.
To that end, you'll be able to fulfill a police, who's still a lot of your efforts.
The news are passions outside the car.
It's almost about such interactive animations when Jack's biggest before some wrath and you need to help him so that you press the right button in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But they surprise that these passes are in the game much less than you should wait (in particularly even three).
The result is, but it is to help things, because this element does not have the opportunity to stay low and in the context of the above, it is so aligned to the elements that are playing.
The ring model goes in the past parts.
It means that it's not a decisive person in today, but it's not going to say that it's a threat.
If you're looking for reality simulation, you'll have to look at anywhere.
But more accurately, the remote driving model is still very well, although we could find better in the competition.
So when it's all right, it's just okay.
Problems are starting to find out for some time.
It's not a cool model.
From the game of this type we don't expect that it counts compatible deformations and colizes, but if practically before any of yours in any object you don't have the less understanding how your car is stored, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you're preventing or driving a car in a regular operation, you'll have sometimes easily older one another, but at least identical situation, your car will end your car in strange pirates.
Or it's just a hit.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter particularly, but it's going to distribute you.
Restarts are resolved so that if you're talking or going far away, you're going back to the last tract point.
Only restarts are available only five.
When you're kidding them, you need to start again from the beginning.
So it's almost such a help for the case that it's not going to do anything before you could argue on them.
Sometimes, however, no restarts can help, it will resolve it until the need to learn to be learned to remember.
The great challenge of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some trackings, for example, are required by a specific way, otherwise you will not be income to them shortly.
You'll always see the "civil" cars in the same configuration to come there first, five, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is particularly in situations when you see how between two contrary cars suffers before you, while you get there, the cars are already in the position that you have to eat or cut them up.
It's one time you're going to them because it's "computed" so that it's always going to your nose.
The supporters also have another exhibition.
At all, you're going to play at some places where you're, without the time again, the same support will always be on the same place.
Moreover, it's going to finish the game on the long bottle where you're going in the contrast.
The manufacturer needs to get it clearly for any price.
When he goes before you, so you're amazing the front of the cars, so you're going to get a few times in the beginning.
It's able to understand the purpose to make the game more increasing and adrenal, but it's so clear that it's going to disappear you likely quickly.
And it's crazy, because even through a simple driving model is playing funny and places, and sometimes, you don't want to watch where it is.
And it's basically one, whether it's a concept with a fifty-uniform contract, the arrangement of conventions so that the nudity has no chance or anything else.
The non-traditional idea is the switch of the car during the shipment.
You have to give attention to benzin pumps on the path, because you just can change the car there, although in most cases you're enough with what you just have.
The car is divided into three categories.
The sports are applied to the cities, powerful American sports on equal daily and exotic supersports for technical shipping, such as by clicking the mountain paths.
With the main story mode, the hand is in hand and the mode of explanation, which are in the individual locations you know of the history.
Here you get not only medail, but also experimental points to your profile that is common for calls and story.
In order to get higher level, the drivers decline various subjects: starting cars and ending backgrounds for profile.
This is also reconnected with on-line Autolog functions, which compares your achieved results with other players and provides more common functions.
One of the other hard comprehensive cocktails is the situation of the last in the history.
With your car you will get into the tunnel of a metro (which), where you married it in the darkness after the bottom.
At the tachometre, you are close to the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (building) and you are lowly driving a meter and you are incomprehensively driving.
In the editing, we might have a few days to discuss whether anyone really did not think about the game, or if the cars have us really a lot of crazy.
The technology page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the total visual age is very nice in most cases and in some cases even great.
It's dead so that in some more explicit moments, it's too tragic in some cases.
But it's particularly the boarder with the largest number of participants, when you'd have no longer been worthy.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a question of input.
In trying to please what the biggest rock of the youngest public has come from the category "All other dog," but it will be supposed that because of the audience of the game of the game, it may not just buy so much.
The Launch is so significantly exposed to Need for Speed.
If the game would be a lot of restrictive errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS for several last years.
But the game doesn't work.
It's probably good, but prepare for you that you'll be mistaken in the eyes of the powerful aircraft reflectors.

EU Vicenna:
Chess have a report of negativists and euro scrapes
"The Lisabon Treaty has explicitly disappointed the equation between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect that it would be such a hard war."
"It's going to keep five, six years before the situation is a little resting, calm, and before all the players will normally be on their new role," she began to show his proposal on the Pravnical Faculty of Chess Highlights at the European Union of Milen Vicen.
As its motive "It's understandable and open about Europe", she has shown seriously in the first part of the proposals when the EU and their relations were able to describe the individual authorities and their relationships as transparent and comprehensive that it could be given to the United Kingdom of Practice.
The Vicens also welcomed the work of the new Standing President of Herman Van Rompuye:
"First she showed criticism that it's unexpected that it's a Seven Officer, that he can't fulfill any role, and I need to say that everything has expressed the darkness that the role has done greatly."
"It's a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate well with them and have a clear view where the European Union should go."
The new post of high representatives for frontier and security policy explained as a response to the question: "Who is this European Union? I'm calling to what phone number?", so as a significant step to conjunction and greater reading of the EU policies between States, such as China or India.
Nobody wants us to deny the shirts.
The Vicen has been convinced and the Agency which the European Council lives and will live at the nearest time.
The Chairman's pre-President stated success.
The Chess decided the following financial crisis, resolved the crisis of the plot or raised the summits for the East Partnership.
The passengers of the governments in this time then indicated a great negative that the Czech Republic was very strongly encouraging.
The Czech Agreement in the EU is currently very excited.
The word "fat frmol" was not only the president, but also the next financial crisis that is resolved today.
Furthermore, the new seventh-year budget should be approved, which is just complicated because of the current economic situation.
Should the payment of the low and efficient, which will receive the presence of the countries that will be supported more and less, all of them are in accordance with the following actions.
She also reminded her main slogans, which came to Brussels, "O Europe comprehensive."
"I really don't like smoking shortcuts, strange words, hotshot that nobody understands.
As the citizens have to understand that they really don't have been covered or covered in Brussels, banks differently, or that someone really needs to deny the shirts."
He also wants to use the EU and to bring more Czechs to the European institutions.
He waits for us a multi-speed Europe
According to the majority of the Chess have the report of Eurospeptics and people who are most negative than the positive sides of things.
Moreover, it is a lower approach to the Chess in the European institutions.
In the case of it, many factors, for example, the absence of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech Party.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, he exalted the strength and cooperation of the Vice-Grad four.
"Remember me that when Poland and Hungary come after me and gets close to the Slovak, then the French will say to me, "Hey, what are you going to do with your Vicegrad's four?" and it doesn't be surprised."
In the future Union, under Vicens, the new rules for the budget policies of Member States are expected.
As a very real, then the concept of double-speedness, not the more speed Europe, less than the new "European Federation".
"We have a Eurozone and a country standing beside the eurozone."
"We have spacer Schengen, we've already got a co-operation institution."
"Before it was said that they would cooperate only the lands they want, and those who do not want to stand back."
"Their institutions will be more and it will be strongly two-speed Europe," expects Vicen.
In this regard, the task of the Republic of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye was also appreciated in the provision of the principles under which all the subjects have affected the European Union were designed to establish between all Member States, not only among the eurozone countries.
Brand story:
IBM Invader begins the second century his existence
If someone looked for the words that IBM strategy expressed, it would probably be "length".
For wide publicity IBM is the IBM technical revolution symbol, it is a firm exploited as very present, and however, since its consent has been over 100 years ago.
Based on this length, the first boss of the company, Vice-Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already considered the password that a number of world problems may be easy to resolve if people want to think.
His password "Think!" has been so active, around which it will be considered the future gigante life (and also the name of the internal journal that IBM started to go out in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's firm-built industry.
"For us from IBM, the long-term thought of the continuous move to the future.
IBM survived and experiencing hundred years because she remained faithful of her basic values, and then she was not afraid to change all others around herself.
This allowed us to transform technologies, buildings and company during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred of these things we can get more, ” he noted the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano.
Proposed system
Watson in the thirty-years was accessed to his employment as Batja's businessman in Czech - IBM people had as one of the first American employees in place, ensure from the employee more elegant employee uniform and processed system for the best experts and businesses.
The same processed IBM has a long time and relationship with the register.
The society was from the beginning of talents-- as one of the first world's fires denied any discriminatory, so it could be chosen.
In accordance with the antidiscrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan in the IBM role in the next year is a woman - Virginia Romanty.
This IBM has been 30 years old, still remains the position of the leaders of selling, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years makes such jamy, on-line brainstormingy, which develops many future strategy and innovation.
It's not amazing that ideas are enough -- it works about half million people in the business.
Institution with a good name
A certain location in the business ensures the company of her strong internal and external image.
"On the beginning IBM had a major concept of institutions than only technological companies," said Professor Harvard Business School and the author of IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps to resolve agricultural problems for the use of technologies," added George Colony from the consultative company Forrester Research.
As the company says itself, it is a difference between entering into the market and creating the market equally.
IBM - or "The Great Blue" as it is because of her log in the United States familyly overseas - for hundred years she grows into one of the largest world fires.
It is, of course, most recent technological company - develop hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in the school of products from servers after nanotechnology.
The most patents of all American technological firms and five of her employees have received Nobel's price.
In the middle of its findings, the banks, the payment card, the financial swap, the number code or the diskety.
IBM was a total of 220 billion dollars in the years became the second biggest technological company according to market capitalization (price is Apple) when Microsoft was first presented since 1996.
Previous View
Not all products and innovations are trefiled in the input and time - IBM was not able to carry on the own operating system OS/2, on-line services Prodigy or IBM PCJr.
"If your neighbors are set before, you can't be emotionally thrown in the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms - and if they don't function, let them leave.
On a separation from the Microsoft competition, which is based on and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
On IBM markets, the largest measures of services are shared, after the fifty is creating software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990, he was with more than half part of the strongest hardware holder.
Since 2000, IBM sold a lot of valuable activity in $15 billion, while even $58 billion to buy perspective technology.
Investments continues to continue since 2008 when the first world has exceeded the new financial crisis.
IBM acts according to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased both investment during the great economic crisis.
It looks like IBM's current crisis is not undertaken.
The price of IBM from the beginning of 2008 is raised on 120 per cent of rackets, pure rate of the company continues to grow.
Firma IBM password is to change everything, only its values are not.
That is why you can expect that even when another crisis comes, this flexible gigant will be capable of it.
IBM history: From the ships to the universe
The IBM community (IBM International Business Machines) was raised in New York for hundred years ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of IBM was referred to in 1924 - originally used for companies in Canada and South America.
Based on the latter IBM, IBM was given four fires, which story has been achieved for the eighth years of the nineteenth century.
The technology was owned as the requirement of "shirts", so the hours of the employer's arrival and department.
The architecture of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also preached the advice of the company in 1930.
Flint took the leader of the competitive company Thomas J. Watson to help him with the company's management.
Lydr then stimulated IBM baseholders - on Watson's thoughts are still established increasing business culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as she says her name, started with the production and sale of all powerful machines for buses - from the carpets of the meat and the seed of the pockets.
During the first four years, Watson's office, he was doubled to fight for nine million dollars and started a wide expansion of the company to all the world.
Watson was so unreasonable for the company that about 40 years in the shepherd's crowd he threw him his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his IBM leader, IBM started working on the development of intelligence, she developed the first programming language.
In the sixty years, people and computers of IBM helped NASA to lead years to the universe - in Mercur, Saturn and in 1969 a honourable man in the month.
At least in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM System/360.
The classic "pecheco" that has received the computer standard that time, named IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
For twenty years later IBM sold the production of Chinese computers of Lenovo, and then buyed a consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers and began completely carrying advice and service with highly added value.
Strategy, which is exposed in the last three years of IBM, is the concept of Smarter Planet, the "creasing planet".
Its goal is a clear use of technologies in still not planned areas and a improvement of the situation, for example, in order to promote or prepare cities.
A recent IBM platform "Smarter Commerce", which helps traders to guide the whole commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong story and in the tumor.
His neighbor founded in the following Czech Slovakia in 1932 as in the first country in Central and East Europe.
This is today, except IBM CHR, a strategic outsourcing centre in Brna.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is in Praia and here is also a research team of the world-wide team that is concerned with the recognition of the vote.
Reserve on unbelieving husband:
Iveto, let that dog, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Recipient (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Richtar (53) was not only a protector of Ivety Bartoš (45), but also a thousand, Darina had hoped that Joseph would go out of the red dream and return home.
Only waiting for a long time, and to the next life, it sets clear rules.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," she explained the River.
When Darina Richter gave Bartosh asil in her house, she probably didn’t seem to end her marriage.
Although Iveta was departing from the Roman 30 days for her relief, Pepa didn't leave the song.
He even recognized that he loved her.
By the time of Darina, she rejected her husband’s relationship, and now she gave him a delight forever.
He doesn't care who his wife sleeps
If the Richter and Bartosh had only been separated once, the house's open officer would not wait for him.
"It's a biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will throw it out."
"It's not like my loved, dear old ass, but as a man with which I have a certain vessel," advised the Ritter with that she had already repeated from her husband and remained just on one another.
Joseph's that Darina closed his back back, he's not worried.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'm gonna be Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"The man has set a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The Firma's going, I'm trying to change, garden, insufficiency, I'll buy."
"Now with Darina we're totally baptized, we're not shared lying together," said the Blessy Ritter.
If the Ritter also found a new love, he won't be struck in it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he's going with who he's going and if he has a friend.
I know that it's my fault, I loved me to Iveta and take me all the responsibility," Joseph closed.
The worst women's worms: do they touch you too?
When you ask men if they could call a type of female disorders, they all reported to one is very ready to get out of the hand.
Beloved women, do you know in the following lines where there are some women's faults that can be able to fully cut blood in the lives?
Buying
Did he tell you your second half, that you're intended to buy?
Do you have to buy at least one guest for a week?
You're welcome the favorite and greatly in the snows?
Then, in your case, it's gonna talk about the purchase as a crime.
Some women know that they should at least get a little back.
But tell you that it would just go through businesses with clothes, look for yourself well falling tops, and then try them all (i.e. in different color outputs) in the cabin?
Although it's for the most women to buy a soldier, the man can become a perfect hot hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told you to wait for you before you entered...
Unfortunateness
"I'm not so drunk?"
"I'd need to destroy at least five kilos -- I'd have to start smoking?"
"I love you all right?"
Didn't they remind you of something?
That's right?
Then you're the women who's staying in the way they look.
Not that you should stop thinking about yourself, but many men are just alergic to how their partners are still disturbing their views.
The stronger head is also agreed that as the frequency of this disaster increases, women are better.
Order and cleaning on the first place
It's like an infinite colot.
The windows, the shopping, the shooting, the shooting, the shooting of the vans, and it's at least twice a week.
Did you tell the partner that he rolled the sprinkle feet on clean food, children, who stopped the smoke of the smoke and cut off the straight wall, with which you have done so many jobs?
If you suffer this "conscious", try to realize that nothing is overcome, and the orders and cleans would not have decided to stay in the family's frame on the first place.
This unbelievable threat after cleaning can also cause your relationships and family affairs.
Smoking
"You're using trainers, go to the waste."
"You're going to get your old legs too tomorrow?"
"It's not a good assurance in the ground."
If you're telling this to your partner a couple of times for a day, you know that you're going to get it likely.
Of course you don't think that's a bad thing, you want to get it so that it's all right.
Maybe if the men knew that women wouldn't have to get so much...
Smoking, smoking
For some women, there are also proper talks, drugs, but also suffering and community against someone.
Women are involved in relationships, so they like to do things like someone, where, with whom, and why.
Maybe each of us's a little unbelievable drb or a cleave to get out of here.
Hand on the heart, it's probably all women.
Once again, they are the worst of the most severe cerebral that they like and often threaten, even if they turn to everybody and are for their circuits - mainly in the framework of women's work collection - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracher helped assistants to the winter of Philadelphia
The Hokey Attorney Jaromir Jagr participated in the Sunday explosion of NHL to two assistants on the winning of Philadelphia 5:3 on the ground of Carolina, and it is again in the family of the Chess players in the chair.
Since the 1930-year-year stars, Claude Giroux was driving in both cases, who added another game and was called to the best player of safeguard.
Two assistants in the book also recorded Jagre's co-operator Jacob Voráč.
Jagr after the explosion of the sea newspapers said Giroux had told him a great evening.
"I've told him that he's getting hattrick."
"I felt it."
"It's sometimes that feels you're going to fall," explained Jagr after his action Giroux's gol from the first Flyers' First Shooter.
A minute later, he had the second step of the team.
The shooter built for the door of Hurricanes catch and presented him between the crowns of Max Talbot.
One second before the first stop he reduced a home player Patrick Dwyer, but Flyers reviewed the second part.
Specially Giroux.
After collaboration with Jagrem, he shot the third hair, then his shooting turned to the fourth gate of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that it's the best player in the list, but it's probably between the best three," he appreciated Jagr his center.
"I'll never think I'll play with a hookie as he is."
"I'm happy for that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my colleagues tried to play me, now it turns," added Jagr.
Carolina made a drama, the role of Tuoma Rutua, and again Dwyer, who was asked of a criminal shooting, was achieved in the difference of one branch.
Another complication, but Matt Read didn't allow Matt Read, who ended the number two on one.
"It's a lot in our Pronger's path."
"He smoked the cat, I took the speed and (Read) went to a far far away."
"I tried to treff him and I like that it's gone," described the last branch of the story from his view.
Philadelphia was gathered into the East Conference Chamber.
The Czech Rebellion of Montreal Jaroslav Spačk was not able to escape against Buffal, in the third time he departed because of the wound in the top of the body.
Candides were lost by the test beach, both two-branches leaders and lost after penalty shot 2:3.
One of their travels did not transform Thomas Plekanec.
The home trainer nearly than the lost point was dead, broken the grounds of the ground, and the grounds were only achieved to five fronts.
"It's bad."
"The study was only one experimented player, the rest of the young."
"But with this, we have to do nothing to do, we have to do this," said Jacques Martin.
"The order for the office has been struggled on us and we couldn't go back."
"We had more to join the game, to get out of our puzzle."
We had spaces in that," added one of the P.K. Subbans.
The Czech Büro Ondrei Pavelec made 30 winnipeg-based at the east 5:2 over Tampoo Bay.
On Jets, who stopped the fifth-series of proher, were divided by five different shoes.
How the revenue prices have been increased since 1989
In 1989, only five state travel officers were authorised by the Czech, Sportrist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The officers were sold in the third majority only in the country of socialistic blocks, since the traveling to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists so went to the Sea to NDR (The Democratic Republic of Germany), to the Soviet Sweet (Shoki on Krym at the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balton).
Great exception was from 1962 to 1972 when the opportunity was to go to Jugoslavia, and then the Yugoslavia mode was attached to the West and the ways of the Chinese tourists to Jugoslavia were finally restricted.
The large paradox of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist block (e.g. the Chechoslovakes) were not allowed individually to travel freely nor in the socialist countries.
In the case of the Czech Slovenian citizens wanted individually to move to Poland or Sweden, he needed a call letter from this country, otherwise there was no individual route possible.
The officer at that time offered the offices and the passengers in the West, however, it was necessary to get the front through night with space, or to have the travel office "Good Known".
However, it wasn't cut off.
The proverb, which was a condition for the ways to the West, was not made "politically incompatible people" which could not exceed so.
The Czech Slovakian change was not freely changing, without a devised vote, so it was impossible to get financial media (west-end) to the West.
However, most often, Czech has trained the allowance in the tissue, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalups that Chess had raised and this sound survives to day.
The resistance of the Czech has thus been a real revolution since 1989.
While the NDR or Bulgarian was allowed to be the most largest of the NDR or Bulgarian to 1989, the branches of the Czech in the territory of 4,5 miles in the entire world.
The serious paradox that we do not know today is that the most popular Croatia has not been able to walk freely until 1989, since it was part of Yugoslavia.
In the past 90th century, the water obligations were disappeared to the subsequent European countries, which had been launched by a large row of short-code visits in the first race Vienna or Germany.
The chirurgs couldn't take a long time to the West, everybody wanted to look at at at least a minute.
For example, in Paris, the Chess' in the parks of the parks, because we did not allow us to pay a hotel or a pension.
The typical character of traveling the Chess was in this time the leader of their own food, concerts, academies.
Another important moment was to introduce a free-changeable cheese corner, which our tourists could finally buy the western change for many years.
However, our life level and the average payments, however, have been exposed around 1997 in another important time.
The higher issues after traveling began regularly from 1997 to prepare charter aeroplanes, with the possibility of aeroplane amounts in comparison with the past.
At the end of the 90th century, the Czech has already been practically in all world-wide countries, except the United States, which has further improved our traveling.
Another interesting moment in the history of the forevolution traveling was immediately in 2000, when the significant question was published from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter year to exotic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, each year, with the Chinese tourists, direct characters in the long-term countries, the air cycle will flee directly from the CRR to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are now visited about 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our forevolution development, has come in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States had abbreviation for the Czech tourists, so our country was definitively arranged between the most successful country of the world.
In 2008, the first in the history of the Czech reached more than half of their freezers (50,3%) and first in the history was lost for one of the border allowed, including costs in the place of residence, more than 15,000.
The vacuum must find the President again, but it's horrible.
At least five months, the Czech photoball is without the President and is terrified that Ivan Haschka is not recognized by the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR) nor after the other strange valable assembly which is in Nimburg.
However, there is no agreement, according to what choice will be done.
Without her, she will not begin to vote about the three candidates to be chosen.
I can take the Chess photoball with Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Pacikak.
Hashek renewed the function in June and invited colleagues to join and find a strong person that would lead a football in the future.
Only in the age after Hashko's football, he turned back to half between both swimming comor, which can't be agreed with the common candidate.
It was fully shown on 16 September when the new President had to be chosen.
The delegates of the valable crowds have been locked in the National House in Prae at the Smich assembly for too much, because the operation was locked and was not only on the way of choice.
There is no agreement that has the right to vote to the group, whether only the statutory leaders, or also the fulfillment functioners are full of power.
In this one point, a party agreement has been established, as well as the recommendation of the Agency for State and the law in which the implementation on the basis of the full power is not possible.
But they still rule on the choice.
It has not been clear that the Executive Committee, which has already been taken on his actions, to make any other decisions in the case of the right or extraordinary.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question seems: how to go in 3 rounds to exclude the possibility of the path?
"The sport is, in accordance with state or find another model," one of the three officers of the FACHR Duschan Freedom, which is a professional football in the direction of the association.
According to the established model in the third role, the candidate will win a larger percentage support in the comor which can be able to provide.
Morava is fully wanted to go to the procedure to win a candidate that gets a higher number of procent of voices from both comor.
And the Chess Page provides the conditions that the wind must be in this percentage to get at least two-third overcome.
"If it would have been the meaning of two previous rounds, it would be completely cut off the two-commerce concept," understands the Maritime parts of the Freedom, in which it would be the best line that would not go and vote according to the valid statements.
With some surprising agreement, Thomas Pacific, although the stated choice line is exhausted from all the candidates most of Pelto.
"I'm going to call it maximumly according to the status."
"In order to not imagine some aspects like at the past valable assembly," reported Major Victoria Plzeň, who condemns the first and in his expressions, especially against Pelto.
Pelta remains optimist.
In the Nimburch, the new President will be known and believe that the candidates will cooperate in the future.
"All you are very quiet today the national team procedure for the mystery of Europe."
"Fotbal will again be happy, it will be greater to cooperate," a minor jablone operator who has the greatest experience with the photoball management as professional, regional level.
Rajchl's more sustainable.
"I hope in the agreement, but the dignity of the situation is a lot of disappearance."
"It's not between the people of the Czech and the Moravs, but there are trials to apply the rules."
"This can make it to block the valable crowds again."
"But I hope you win a healthy understanding," said Rajchl.
It's not a lot of time for the agreement of all the parties.
Some actions had to be fully able to gain directly in Black Mountain, who knows whether the photobal generality will be absolutely complete.
The aeroplane in which they had to go to Podgorica outside other locations, Dalibor Kučar and Rajchl, which had not gone from Praha because of the technical breakfast of the morning, and was looking for a replacement variable as part of the Executive Committee to the history of barsheets.
Finally, a decision on the ministry level will be decided to be increasingly in the middle.
The Ministry of School, Young and Body of Josef Dobeš would like to contribute to the distributed parties within the most strongest sport association in the country to the agreement.
In the game, there is a lot of: State question, photoball confidentiality, and there is also a valid crowd of CSTV that will resolve the new Chess Sport on Sazki's financial problems.
The Package goes to the Chairman because he doesn't see the right candidate
If the chief of the photobalists had seen Tomás Pacific before a strange valley crowd, a strong candidate, who would fulfil all his opinions on the new President Fotbal Association of the Republic of the Czech Republic (FACHR), and would not have been attached to the fight against the top function.
"If the quality approach exists, I fight for him and I'm not in choice."
"But for the present situation there was no such one,' said the Package.
In the convention with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchlem the Pacific Motive of the Pacific Motives, that he tried to cut down the road to the FACHR chair.
The package also indicates that in the case of its victory, the Chairman would only be reached until 2013 when it is a range of vacuum threats on the programme.
In the function, he would like to see an experimented and spectacular manager who is not too attached to the photoball operation.
"I spoke with some people who would come in mind."
"It was crazy for me when some said that they don't want to identify the Czech photoball in this moment."
"I'd like to change the way," he said.
The Pacific is now from the most worthy of Peltova's connection with the President of the National Fotball Sweet Roman Berbrem, a man with the contrary report that is in school known as a powerful lobbyist to influence the vote of delegates on the valley crowd.
It's so inacceptable for the Package that Pelta stays in the presidency position.
"If he won, he's observed the current status and nothing would happen in the photoball."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, which is the first businessman, it wouldn't help any more," spoke Pacific.
It also suggests that the name of Pelta was mentioned in the last years ago in the investigation of corruption, however, from which Pelta went out without trespass.
"I don't know how the photoball would bring Pelt's winning."
"And how we should also seem in the EUFA and FIFA eyes," said the Package, which also takes in consideration of our next statement that he would "produce the Plench club if Pelta becomes president."
If Pakistan would triumph triumph in the fourth choice, he would prove to present the future cooperation with Pelta.
In the same way, there is also another candidate Rajchl, which the Pacific supported before the guard of the valley, which has finished by the son.
"He would be the first one I would follow."
"I have great skills."
"I could imagine him as a chef of representation."
"But the manager wouldn't lead the association."
"I don't also shoot the nine where I can't do it," advised the Package, which in September raised a great attention to the Commission's calling in the chair with the Macelo, who replaced Dagmar Damk.
The Package says that it's going to lead the fuel association.
It is rejected to its capacity from the management of private firms, since the past year, also leads Plzni, who, with its support in May, glorified the premier ring triumph.
"I have power to change something in the photoball environment to join his specific culture."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups that have to affect the tendencies to influence the disciple and calling Commission, which comes to the situations that are unreasonable," reported Pacific, noting their antipaties, for example, to the spanish shepherd Daniel's Christian.
One of the priorities would also be considered that the FACHR relationships with the Czech Olympian Committee, with which it would help in political shops to achieve more money from the airport.
"It's one of the key things that the new President should be able to win."
"If it comes to think of a hazard, as the political parties declare, so I understand their arguments, but at the end they have to say where the money will go," he noted.
As now Pacific doesn't have its partnership with the Plengin club, it would say that the Chairman of the FACHR should be "instranical."
Pelta is connected again to Jablok, Rajchl with the gorgeous Duklo.
"It's not ideal."
"I don't see, but no sense in that I'm in secretly transforming my action in the pneumatic club and for a year and half back there," brought the Packack.
Pelta promised new FACHR states to exclude choice path
Two days before the valley football association, one of the candidates to the President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the case of choice of principles, the FACHR had to have new states that would definitely exclude the sports of the election.
The Japanese functioner is before the fourth operation in Nymburce optimist and believes that the pre-selectable battle explicitly disappears the success of the photobal representation today.
Pilta had already promised that the representative and reaching financial resources would be agreed in the case of central election.
He decided to go to the last moment before the last valley crowd, so he could take a two-mone rate to start his pictures on the management of the photoball and present in a larger context.
"The people on all levels make a photoball a lot of long time and wait for the President in the fourth."
"He feels that it's the highest time to lead someone's association," the less man who is associated in particular with the jabble club, but whose number of years has worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That is why he thinks that he has enough experiences to guide the Czech football.
It is convinced that, for the current problems of choice, it is an eufore that dominated in Ivan Haschka government.
"Great on the Red Valentine Gardens were approved states that were not perfectly as they all thought."
"If it was not allowed to allow various expenditures, the President had already been since September," announced Pelt.
The reform of the most important document of the citizen agreement has been taken as a result of the delegated delegated.
"If I will stand by the President, I will take it as a personal task and I will make a personal responsibility if it does not happen."
"It's the first thing we can't be," said Pelta.
He continues to try not to cut off against their sufferers.
He had already stated that he could present a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchlem, which recognizes his legal education, and well knows that his anticandidate would be his first officer.
He wasn't a long time touched to Thomas Package, who didn't even leave a smoke on Pelt.
"In the photoball, something moves for a year, he got some success."
"But his attacks were imperfect and many people in the way the election campaign was cutting."
"It's why a number of them is now surprised about his real character," said to the contrary address of Pelta, who remains a faithful proclamation that he has already announced in September.
His strongest weapons are according to him to knowing the photoball from the lower coaches until after the representation.
That should be a high-shirt photoball.
"And I'd also try to finish all the afers starting the bohemians cazzo or the sound of the lone corruption skandal."
"Now, I'd like to act with the private and State sector to ensure the money for the whole football," said the CTK, '60-year-old candidate before two months.
Then he also promised that his arrival to the football chain would not indicate any personal cleaning.
"I should first be known with the fulfillment of individual employees," he reported to the Straight, where long without control the understanding nervousness.
Moreover, the current catastrophic scenarios who are running a valable crowd believe that in the fourth century they will not go to Nimburg too much.
"If it's the only sport point is how it's going to call in the third round, then we'll be able to move it."
"Fotbal needs confidence, and it's only that he will have his leader's finally again," remains Pelta two days before the possible decision day of his functionary carrier optimist.
Rajchl promises that the FACHR would start working hardly.
If the new Chairman of the Fotbal Association of the Czech Republic on the fourth Valent Group was chosen by the Additional Chairman of Jindrich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be satisfied.
Rajchl promises that if his choice is going to work hardly.
He wants to take system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual photoball areas.
He also promised to resolve Bohemians, to improve relations with the EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money to the photograph and continue in the work that Ivan Haschek had started.
"It's like the President I'd like to take a photoball as a whole."
"On international contacts with the EUFA and FIFA on representation, professional photoball, professional photoball after young."
"But I don't say I'd do everything myself," said Rajchl in the conversation for the CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide competence in the Executive Committee so that each of the members have a certain area."
"And I'm going to spend hard jobs to get in every segment a photoball on a milk step forward."
"A lot of people wouldn't be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticize the work of others," added.
Because of critical atmosphere in the football steel, he thought that he wouldn't candidate again.
"I know that I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's gonna be meaning and that I'm not gonna have people behind myself, who will still be housed up under the feet, and bear every one of my steps," he explained why he was wearing.
"A lots of people told me that I don't have to give it to me, because then they would have given it to others."
"This is the confidence that I can't just do so," he said.
It's the motive of him in the work that he started with Hashk.
"Then two years he made a big job, and I don't want to do it now."
"They are initiated processes that will have a call for a few years, and I wouldn't like to stop them," he said with fear that if the other candidate Miroslav Pelty would have the first situation on his own could return time before Hashka.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's what Mire Pelta doesn't die."
"To him, they're first invited people who would make a photoball so that it would be only for you."
"I can calculate a lot of things, but I'm sure it's not that I'm going to get somebody."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a photoball for everyone, because then they'll be all right and not just the choice," he noticed Rajchl.
He's going to make sure that he would be only the President of the Czech.
"And if some people try to turn back, I have to do the plan for Moravy's maximum."
"For example, it's time to think that the second line should be divided in a chess and moral part, which the victory would go to the first line."
"It wouldn't be so present when there are only three of the Moravy totals, which is a problem to the young players on Moravy," said Rajchl.
While the president also had the captain of the Plenum club Thomas Pacikak, Rajchl is not able to make his chance to choose.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech comar, who chose me for his officer and see that they are clearly successful after me," introduced Rajchl, who considers achieving ten million corners on unrighteous contracts, the introduction of TV contracts and the conduct of the aircraft law.
He's also giving it for a community that the shirt doesn't take a piece.
While Philto says that it is "disvalided from to return to the Czech photoball confidence", the second of the Pacific supporters considers a strong candidate who has a photoball to offer something.
"Nobody can realize that in Plzni the year he got a great job."
"If it was chosen, so he would like to continue in the things Ivan Hashek started here, and no matter in particular, he would not change personal conditions in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to do it in his effort," Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful foundation of Europe
Blue shock
Julia Stanek
Brussels from the view of Ufona, the surrounding basen in Budapest: Whoever walks in Europe can use its blue wonder - and after the visiting of the cities or traveling, let their slow feet beat in the termal balls.
The book will show where wellness is in the best water.
When Iris Meder was released in an embarrassed one and half year on a public road, she was not very mistaken: her balls.
When she led a sign on the water, she looked up to the height of artically created coffee, flew against the smooth potter (while a little kid, kids (whispers) who expected her to the border of the base and wondered extremely restaured season flowers.
If some flowers enjoyed her, she brought her into her writer, and with observed details of the way the building and the story of the building.
More than 200 flowers have studied this way by the story of the Meder Architecture and presents it in his right-handed book "Badefreuden (Raadt of Buying) ": People's flowers in Mnich, historical flower balls in Schwarzwald, "Third beton structure" in Taunuso.
13 countries led her "Case for the most recent ranks in Central Europe": Germany, Korea and Switzerland visited locations in Italy, France, Czech, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Germany is a real entity of planting culture.
With sports it's a lot of disappointment, says Meder -- it's just something different in the water.
In relationship with only that fand plants should be satisfied with blue cups and clouds, while they can go to health can devour their own horse of smoking forests or listen to the happiness of birds in the park.
"Any day I asked why the flowers must always be so sweet," says in Vidni Live Miss Meder.
"So I started gathering a beautiful flower."
Water glass doubles the architecture
Discovering in the Scotland base and electric oil for saun - the convention factor is so great that all the senses, Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they may be a real past for the eyes: "The place of the ground has a man in the smoke of water."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it turns the beauty of the whole building."
All of the options are doubled: high clenbee, pearl cachle, shock-shock.
The maloformed image smoke "Badefreuden (Badefreuden)" provides on 190 pages all that needs to know about architectonic and cultural history of historical ranges, but, especially, the smoke to the blue.
The observable exemplars discovered Mrs. Meder's collector in Hungarian.
Under the beautiful treatment, as 100 years old Shecheny in Budapest, there was water with the content of the spiritists in the original crass eggs (in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the termial glass, which the bases are filled with alcalic water and are located in the building of the lavage (Varosi Termalfürde in Jasberi).
The pretty looking at this offers a lot of packed flowers under the wide sky in Switzerland and Rakousca. Although a man has a curioso cooking cooking on the eyes of the whole city, he can look in the foreign booster of St. Anton to see the dream of the secret Arlberg - and: In the parish balls is a window of which can be able to follow the movement on the lyshian conference.
Even the most precious design of the base waits for the lazean hosts in Langenfeld: Avapark Ötztal seems like a phone that just arrived in Alpach.
From the top of three open pairs in the shadow stays a couple while in the ground of the Mount Otztal goes to the sky.
Alhambra and Blackwaldu
Not in every floor, Mrs. Meder's basen collector made the clown clown in the clown.
Many termal smokes are feeling along the smoke, in the Hungarian Bekessba, it will smooth through the top oil in the meaning that a man is able to believe he got into the medicine.
The vessels come from the treatment of water with alcal hydrogenuglizers that are almost black and which are stealing on the ground, while only a man is attached to the bathroom - some of the special interests of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also a place in her searching for beautiful dreams: when she wanted to visit the Chess Solitary and climate glass in Luhačovice, she ran into the closed territory.
In 1902, Duschan's Architect was intermediately closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked out with the windows of red-white-year-year-sheed seen, she had seen how he might have grown up the plot between the forests.
The sanctuary was set against it in a scarlet flower in Blackzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These are increasingly three phases of design; a man can find not only new romantic elements that come from their relationship in 1844, but also a maus wall in the Alhambra style, which was connected around 1900.
Since 1995, Palais Thermal is the favorite place of Lazean's beauty of Mrs. Iris Meder, and it is not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's a sort of exercise, connecting such a variety of structures to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a packaging, there is, of course, a marginal matter of the termal basis.
Agriculture speculation
Deutsche Bank is allowed to check the trade with the commissions
Christian Teevs
Did Deutsche Bank leave his business with agricultural surveys?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann's Working Group confirmed to investigate the consequences of specialization for the poor world.
Then in January, the boss of the concert wants to bring out the results.
Hamburg -
For society citizens, it is clear: 84% of the Germans are based on one studio for non-acceptable to scale the banks with agricultural surveys as pseudo or cook.
Two third-term questions require the Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions from this trade because these problems of the world's most important.
This is the result of the Fors Anket of the Consumer Organization of Foodwatch.
The study is concerned about the report that Foodwatch presented in half October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the costs in the global comodial builds are carried out prices to high and the banks are therefore not a community on the world's problem of famine.
The campaign of consumer protection is particularly confronted to the Boss Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Communications were originally considered to ensure that the tradeholders were insured against the costs of prices.
However, most experts agree that the participants of the capital market with interest on high risk trade have been rejected from offers and questions - and on the most important accounts have been reached.
Unless competitors in the United States reacted to the Ackermann crisis: He promised that the expenditures believed and said that no trade would be "the fact that the good news of Deutsche Bank would be given in the field."
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group of Effects from Foodwatch-Report controls.
At the end of the year, the results will be submitted to the presentation of the Deutsche Bank - together with the recommendation of how to be established.
At the end of the year, the representatives of the bank will then be dealt with what results they will be carried out.
Finally, the reduction of trades with coads or even a complete refusal may be reduced.
Ackermann works his help on his image.
The Boss of Foodwatch Thilo Bode reported, but currently broadcast his criticism of the financial investment: "State on increased food prices shows particularly drastically as the banks are fair to the entire joy today."
Let Ackermann be the highest bank lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank has to lock out from his portfolio all items used for the money for food price," said Bode.
"It's good if Mr. Ackermann's famine is about the hungry of people or the Deutsche Bank's report."
Ackermann's view is the first view as a surprise, but it is clear that the concert boss a few months before his department from the office would like to leave the perfect image.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the boss of representation would not come to the supervisory Council.
Returning from a sport agro-speculation could improve your image.
And about the possible loss, it should not be aware of that, in the end of his conduct.
Each second investment in the surface
Foodwatch's trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
There has been shared more than 30,000 Internet users in the organization campaign.
In the outside, Bode published anket, in which the Institute Force was asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Just once per cent, according to this, is legal that Deutsche Bank provides investments related to food prices.
Many bank customers would also take personal results if they had found that their bank is shared in such businesses: each other would consider all the investments in which the money is declined to spread with surveys.
43 per cent would be warned before such a bank, 49 per cent had stated that he was considering its account and moved to another institution.
Home of the 21th century in Vienna
Moved Pavilon
Ingeborg Winesowski
The architecture of the tops, falls and happy ends: Rakousky Pavilon from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 was achieved prices, became in Vidni Museum, remained empty and left.
Now it's opened again as an expensive house.
When it goes to modern military architecture, for clear shapes, slides, slides and new structure materials that are typical for the faith in technical progress, then the raccoon architect Karla Schwanzer for the Brussels World Building of 1958 is a high and glorious example.
Swanzer's pavilon received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his light and highly exploited buildings from the ocean and sculpture.
The state is still based on miles of the current architecture.
He announced the architecture so that he also built the Pavilon of Rakouska for the next world.
With his legal fourth BMW packaging plus as the key of the next stage in Mnich, he was in the end of 1973 prophesied internationally.
His as a temporary exhibition designed pavilon after the world exhibition was located in Swiss Garten in the Vienna South Baynhof (Jewish Trade), reconstructed and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - was called "Home of the 20th century".
But it wasn't appropriate for the building museum, neither space nor technically - the walls were mistakes for the end of artificial expounds, no climate.
However, it was used until the current arte was not attained in Vienna's new tent.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was still more and more.
Now Adolf Krishanitz architecture rebuild pavilon, now the name is "Home of the 21th century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of the current science.
On the night, the Museum Belvedere is opened in the board, the first design - a happy purpose in each respect.
He asked the new start of Agnes Huslein-Arco, which became a new director of the Rakou Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical science with a significant carrier, e.g. in the young crossbreacher, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's museum, and as a based director of Musea modern Salzburg, prosecuted strictly rebuilding policies and memorators, watched public media and private social money and determined use.
In addition to the current science, Fritze Wotruby's office should be established as a single place, it should be reduced by chair and book-up, and it should be established by the office building.
Excellent exam, low payment.
Then Krishanitz was the ideal circumstances.
Not only that he reconstructed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's sex status in Vidni and gathered counsel, but because he studied at Swanzer's Technical University at Vieding and Pavilon was for him "increasingly important place", where he looked "only every week."
He knew the project, and he also knew the problems of buildings that had already lost in his movement to Vienna and the change of use of its greatness and difficulty.
At the present rebuilding, there were a lot of greater problems: Buddhis was a "capult for Energy", says Krishanitz.
The profiles of the windows rolled fasads were replaced, using the slidesed glass of isolated steel and the smooth steel was replaced by special security steel.
Chloed monkeys-cel nests were broken or removaled, and the axes filled were mentioned.
Two undergrounds offered a place for new use, allowed by lighting channel between the building and the street, a lightning, to the entrance of the middle - almost new plane, but still bringing up Swanzer's pavilon.
The original entrance doors remained locked, the building is covered in an anticorsy-rounded tone.
And the kinosal is even exactly the same as he was before.
And that's all for a positive monitoring of the memorandum Office and the low budget.
"The lot has to be found a material that is good and living and also liked the memorandum office," says Krishanitz, and shows it on the floor of the sutheren.
All pressures, problems and rebuilding have remained flexible and aircraft.
It was hard with the pavillon, "the one who came here from Brussel," said recently, "Drop-in-the-City-historic."
That architecture is always "in a bad place" and he wants to "build a significant self-conscious."
In this case, but the 21th century's house is not at an unlikely place, because the urbanistic happiness agreement has been agreed: In the course of Switzerland Garten, the new projected "Cursor quarter in the Main Trade" with officers and resident houses.
And even more happy agreements: Home of the 21th century could have a support from the other Christian's construction, because the company Francesca van Habsburg buyed Berliner Temporere Kunsthalle and how to hear them, he is already one with a citizenship in Swiss Garten.
The tree plans an increasing crisis in millions of high
The tree spreads a crisis plan to protect the events of the bullets in the range of time.
The number of employees must be doubled.
It's gonna be millions.
In the fight against the smooth caused incidents of branches and deterioration, Deutsche Bahn gives Deutsche Bahn in this year according to the report in news more than 70 million euros.
The "Image" news have submitted a previously report with the call on the internal concert plan that it will be calculated in 2015 with a total investment at about 300 million euros.
The aid of him should be low to use the better use of balls and the next network also for external air conditions.
The number of internal and external employees of 16,000 persons is planned to remove snow on fertilizing devices and training.
The objective must be delivered to the launch of operation and 90% for the implementation of required exhaustions during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, he warned the chef Rüdiger Grub after meeting at the highest level with the representatives of government and industries before the accidents of the hair and the afternoon also during the air zone.
In the past range period, there had a travel in personal promotion significant problems, since others for difficult air conditions had no reserve.
So they wait for reading new regional aircrafts a year ago to approve the Community's fertilization Office.
In addition, ICE's subsequently access to the replacement of the ICE flows
The train is also not yet controlled that ICE's transports must be often allowed to control the party when the ICE has arrived in one floor on the main industries of Köln to destroy the transport.
Deutsche Bank pays a million investment in the United States
After starting around the boss Josefa Ackerman, there is a new trampot in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions off.
As if the Deutsche Bank had no longer enough problems, the Deutsche Bank had reached his previous statement in the United States: the Frankfurt institution paid in one compared management of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to compare sports because of the bank of five large type banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling hypothesis letters.
The NCNUA financial market regulator calculates a total number of large banks that the typical banks have made false promises to buy financial products; that risks have probably been reduced.
These papers were lost in the period of crisis significantly in the value and shopping banks with themselves into the propaganda.
"We're happy that we could resolve the subject, and it wasn't necessary to vote to the court," said the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't accept any accusation.
This is also paid for Citigroup, which has been taken to pay 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Matz announced the integrity of both money.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is compatible with a type bank in the United States and provides bankrots to protect claims.
NCNUA is trying to reach a replacement for billions of accidents.
Now the fulfillment is the first of their type.
The governor also went up on other large banks and in the year JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In several hypothesis letters, it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They are based on bank credits.
When the American bubble was broken around the disease in 2007, it became a number of financial fires.
In September 2008, the US-Investment Bank Lehman Brothers changed his thoughts on the top of the financial crisis.
Although the event has arrived a few years ago, the banks are currently foolated in the field of the wind.
Investors and surveillance officers have made read requirements to achieve transports or disagreements.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has run the largest full request.
The 18 international major bank is that two United States Financial Financials have been depreciated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in trades with hypotheses in a total of 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also needs to be fulfilled by FHFA, here is a total value of 14,2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The audit Office requires that the frankfurt states respond to the "required losses" and does not have any exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank refused the requirements as unreserved and declared that he wanted to protect.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion IBM
Buffett Financial Gurur is invested in the IBM IBM.
Since March, he buyed an action in more than 10 billion dollars.
The US invester Warren Buffett has always stated that it is not to invest in the IT and computers, because the long-term development of the company is only to prevent difficulties.
However, IBM's business reports now read and changed investments in the branch.
A lot of time before IBM had to understand that IBM provides the first service and orders computer systems for IT distribution of other companies.
Warren Buffetta's investment is based on the financial world for a rating.
In the consequence of this, the Mathematic Horn IT IBM is now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett consulted the CNBC Economic Challenge Station in the American Economic Station, which has buyed IBM action since March to $10.7 billion.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM operators with 5,5 per cent.
Buffett said he didn't know anything about his anguish.
He praised the management that was trying for economic crisis even on a strategy.
"You did a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM is already intended for long-term lucrative IT services as the output of the calculation center.
More than 100 years of computers offer software and advice and executive computers for companies.
Buffett with technological companies for today's worst.
It says that it is investing only to the businesses that also understand.
Instead of this, Buffett was busy after the gas, the manufacturer of mass, or after machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway's own neighborhood at about 80 own girlfriends also shared in a total number of major concerns such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the first Munchener back.
The 81-year-old Mr overseered in the 60-year-old century a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway and built with it a wise investment one of the most precious businesses in the world.
But his way of life is sown.
That is why for many investors throughout the world's cultural position.
He's almost inevitable meaning to make money to him the "Orakel from Omaha (Zaker of Omahy).
When Buffett's investment was known, IBM actions were made before starting the bubble was a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM also called, has a total price over 220 billion dollars and is based together with Apple and Microsoft for the most precious technological businesses of the world.
In the Microsoft business, so much Buffett, but he didn't want to get up.
The officer Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
Agriculture is max.
After disappearing the "Cells in Zwickau" the Turkish media on German law.
The news are even talking about the " blood ideal" which now lives again.
Eight detailed companies of the Turkish origin and one of the Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a real extremist background.
In this report, in Turkey and within the German Turkish citizens in Germany reacted with fear and concern.
Because for many German Turkeys, there was a terrible fear that was made long as dead: from the jururish attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 was not a comparable violence with the real extremist post.
That in Germany there is a xenofobia, yet there was no doubt.
However, the real extremist network discoveres the range that the dimensions are not able to be monitored for a long time.
"Have you relied blood ideals?", the titles of the Internet of the Turkish News "Haberturk".
The newspapers "Start" note that one of the partners should be a secret police officer for the protection of the institutions and are afraid that German authorities may also be entered into the right radical bathrooms.
The Turkish area of Germany reacted deeply: Remembered a weekly demonstration in the front of the Brandeburg's door of the racial violence.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish citizen in Berlin recalled the German and Turkish policies of the celebration act of the 50-year-term German agreement on the Republic.
In the happy colors, a common life was inscending - as a story of success.
As a ring here, a number of Turkish media: "Dark German to 50-year" is the title of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of a murder series.
In addition to the "Hurrity" letter for Germany, it is not allowed to take this thought connection.
"It's starting to lie," says the title of the column from Ahmet Culahci.
It indicates that they were killed people who paid the payment and their work brought an important contribution to the Renew Germany.
The most critical debates are discussed in German Internet Forces of the police procedure and its latter success in the training.
Why the German authorities have not found a lot of time before that the automobiles were surprised in the right extremist crowds were surprised.
So many are leading at least retorically prepared to use the drastical means: "If there is still a activities so highly, there will be nothing other than its own defense and weapons."
"It's probably the best yourself."
"For the quality of clarification and amount of suffering of the whole network, the internal peace in Germany is very strong, "Selen."
What means if the internal peace is grown in Germany, the attentions in Mölln and Solingen in the nineteenth years.
The photography in Solingen is a deep wheel to the German and Turkish memory.
For there was no other event to the Turkish who lived here clearer that there is a significant threat and Germany that the unbelieving and decline can cause the right violence.
However, the attentions made on the Turkey’s side the most comparable feelings of each other.
Do not repeat previous errors
In the touric pressure, the German policy was first criticised after attitudes: Helmut Kohl refused you in Mölln, who survived.
After soldier attacks in Solingen, he sent a turc president to the Turkish president, but left at the contemporary celebration of Köln to enter his minister in the territory of Klaus Kinkelm - Kinkel then in his statement, however, the excursions of Turkish were reached.
It's exactly like the value of the person measured according to the height of his gifts.
The current report of the Turkish media shows again how deep many German Turkeys are untrusted in the highest State legal organization.
Instead of detailed clarification and new evaluation of the legal extern terrorism in Germany, it requires this time open words.
Skandal Bank in the Curry League
The most comprehensive European bank is not in Italy or France but in Switzerland.
The UBS has suffered for financial crisis at least a bankrot, and from that time avoids from one crisis to another.
Now it's got to compare some German.
Axel Weber probably didn't think that.
After its deep department, the Community banks had been known in June 2013 to at least the same spectacular new employment: President of the Governing Board of Switzerland - unexpected and lucrative steps in the carrier.
Axel Weber felt publicly, praised Sweden for his beauty and UBS for her new solidity and told friendly notes to the future colleagues.
"The UBS has been rejected."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villegar and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be entirely different.
One dealer from the UBS in London has covered all bank security systems and has cut off about 1,7 billion euros.
Boss of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the UBS Management Council is also as an arrest - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It's already known that Weber banks from February 2012 will be radiated.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council will now be transmitted in May, not in 2013, as the bank was divided.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
There is no banker, often Professor Economic and Emission Banker, and it would certainly need time for processing.
We will then transmit the responsibility for the bank strategy that just again proved that the title "Bank of the largest scannes in Europe"
For the UBS is, however, big - until the last time, was the greatest dominant of the world - and it is now struggling for years from one scenario to another.
Nothing, so it seems, the Switzerland bank will not stay sharp.
It started for financial crisis.
The UBS was used to use a pretty good news until 2007.
The image of the ambitional and solid, but also the manager of domination is combined with ambitional objectives: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So the UBS 2007 was driving on one side with $1,6 billion more of the interested customers than any other world bank.
And on the other hand, he was put as a investment bank into the largest world banks.
That's what I'm doing.
A banker and a longer long-term banking professor in Curry Hans Geiger says, "I've always shown my students as a model of good banks."
"How could I just miss so?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first obvious that something in the UBS was shown correctly.
In half the year, Peter Wuffli's representative was a surprising captain, who still was based on a high intelligence and also a genial banker.
A few months later, I'm surprised why he's gone.
Investment division of the banks promrized subprime papers and had to receive billion.
In order to stay, UBS showed the increase of the capital in real 13 billion franks.
Therefore, she found actually investors, however, who would have recently restricted the nose: the Inspector Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that a man nor his name was not known.
But it was just the first time.
In April 2008, it has grown a threat.
The Bank has to recognize new billion losses, President of the Administrative Council of Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second placed administrative Council of Switzerland, has gone away.
In January 2008, the UBS followed the catastrophe: The UBS was in respect of its mistakes investments for financial crisis before the exploitation and was to be saved by the State.
National bank was sold from UBS for 10 billion of problem price papers, the Switzerland Confederation has given six billion franks to an obligation that could be a society bank.
The entire Switzerland was threatened - because it was aware of how it was dramatic for a small country when he has so large banks on his ground.
The end was an UBS in 2007 more than five times more than Switzerland's economy economy (see image).
"We couldn't save UBS again," says the bank expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe is the second.
A few months ago, the UBS was captured in a monetary sport with America and showed the achievement to give the data of the employees, which, if possible, the bank rates.
In addition, she agreed to payment of 780 million dollars, as the return of unrighteous ships from these trades, including currency reliefs.
The UBS has been granted more or less openly that he helped the data.
She has now lost something that was declined by her capital in the respect of the rich clients: the officer of discrimination.
After this scenario, Switzerland's bank secret was no longer what was before.
The leader of the representation and the President of the Administrative Council was followed.
And exodus's money for the customers.
Thus, the bank lost his trust in both central trade areas during a few months: in investment banking for bad speculation and in the process of a contribution to the payment of data.
And just when it was a little quiet, just when I thought that the UBS was repeated again, this disaster of business analysis comes here: the only dealer had cut 1,7 billion euro before the bank stated that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with the investment risk management, it seems not yet.
"In the case of Adoboli, I probably found that risk control has changed too much," says Martin Janssen, economy and Financial Professor of Financial Affairs on the Bank University of Zürich.
Financial director of a large German bank is sure that the UBS problem is not controling risk control.
However, it was exactly the idea of awareness that the Switzerland bankers had exceeded a long time ago to become fulfillers of the large riches of the world: no too big risk, therefore security for money - also from this part the Alpa Republic has broken the world.
The Swiss bank trezors became a symbol for non-speaking community such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particular quality chocolate.
The UBS center in Curry is still going to cut a short-good Swiss private bank - is just a little bigger.
The position is classical.
The Bank has its main seat in the Korean Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curry River, which is covered by the tops of the Switzerland mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the trades are the most highest in Europe.
Clenotnicts like Tiffany's are here among Switzerland's traditional trades like sugar Sprungli.
After centuries, there are Switzerland banks: from National Bank over Palast der Credit Suisse until after elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS is entered by severe locked doors.
Inside, the walls are based by the murmur, which stand before them are the potential cowed cross, beside the logue of the banks, a large direction to "seepfu".
UBS knows what the register is looking for: security.
This idea of the Switzerland banks both Switzerland's large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, have been struggled or advised as the boss of a small Switzerland private bank.
His name would not like to read in news, finally, as all Switzerland bankers, also with both big trade banks.
The UBS probably has increased too much, it is surprised - especially in the investment bank office, where the Anglosas has expanded.
The Switzerlands probably don't have anything to say.
"And if you wouldn't, they'd have been applied to the English ways."
It was actually an English investment banking undertaking that UBS has changed her first high cyclic and then a summary: No European financial institution has lost so much money as Sweden.
15 October 2008 was obviously a catastrophe.
"In the middle of it, the government's small coalyce of seven thousands of countries brought up to the largest saved actions in his nation's history," wrote Lucas Hessig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
At 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politics approved to save the bankrot standing.
How could it happen?
If they are talking to the Switzerland bankers, they see the problem in particular in the UBS size.
In June 1998, two of three Switzerland's large banks were associated with the potential concert.
She took the bank that was too big in the small Switzerland, and still grows.
However, it was helped that both various bank presides of the UBS were fulfilled: one rich, but the bank in Curry was able to be able to build in the field of mate and poor, but internationally stronger.
The internationalised investment bankers have come to a lot of money with which they could make a great rule.
With this UBS, two names are linked: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, leader of the UBS and Marcel Ospel, then the President of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a team of future," says the bank officer Hans Geiger.
"Wuffs, the high intelligent, amazing, who knows much about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who leads the feelings around a prison that has made a lot from the bank science."
But Ospel was close to the end at the Wuffli.
And Wuffs at the end, he probably allowed a decision error, "I think he thought his models are reality," says Geiger.
"This is tragic case."
Tragical, maybe.
It's clear: the pigeon has come before.
Officers of UBS are clearly reminded of the employees' rate of the concern boss Wuffli continued to repeat the same password: Srazit Goldman Sachs from the throne Down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the world.
She saw "League Tables", a group who documents the success of the bank at the same time.
The UBS was trying to be entirely upstairs.
Some steps have already happened to her.
In the business with devises and actions, the game was totally upstairs.
However, the competent advisers who have been convinced are increasingly one of the difficulties: in the international resource trade, in the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a large distance to the largest banks.

Mask on personal level
Emotionally strong new book Peter Anglunda with the name of the Beauty and Saturday: Trust history of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of states that are exciting to you.
One advice to keep in this moment: Take care of this page and make a bookmark out of it.
You are very well known with all people in the Roman statement of Mr. England, and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a magnet - in the moment when you feel like men and women in the history, you will feel lost and loss in various situations.
Mr. England is a Swedish history and newspaper.
In addition, it is a new subject to the Sweden Academy which makes Nobel's price for literature.
The book we're talking about here is very common -- the author himself describes it, very carefully, like "anti-historic work."
It contains a number of very known names, important agreements or honourable battles, even though there are almost no majority, energy newspapers and tactics and rescue.
It's not like a book about what happened, explains the author, like "the book of what it was." It's mainly on "emotions, receivements, experiences, and instructions."
"Blessed and amazing" in himself includes the war experiences 20 less toxic men and women, on both sides of barricades, from students and botanics even after horoles, doctors, officers and officers.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Others will be military prisoners, come on the ends, foolish, or die.
Their lives are amazing as the lamps of lights burned in the cow - news are added to the smoke, while others are hazardous.
The book of Mr. England is different from classic historical Romans.
It suggests that the first world war was only about the threatened shipping fights on the west border.
"Beauty and shadow" also researchs other places where the war drama: Alpy, Balkan, Eastern Front, Mezopotamia, Eastern Africa.
The soldiers in this book are soldiers with the problems that fall on them in the middle of the wedding, have to turn the Sunday in the shadow of the pyramid or bear with the future of much tse-tse.
It's about a very interesting reading from the beginning.
The war burns the lives of people as a natural katastrophe, like the Katrin's hurrican's shooting shooter.
When you're going to get a gun out of work, and you're a woman who's home with your children, you're going to escape or stay?
Who really closes this?
At least no one understands what's happening, even why the whole war was disappeared.
"Vakuum from the failure of facts," said Mr. Anglund, "he had been fulfilled with conventions, donations, hopes, challenges, presidences, conspiracy teories, dreams, nightmills and phamas."
"Beauty and beauty" observes the history of individuals, such as Florence Farmborough, English health sister in Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young mariner served in German float.
Their story is totally transferred from lifebooks, letters and others already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives can feel serious and amazing, but thanks to the locking of detailed moments and details are very living and trustable.
Many of them are involved on the training and equipment with him.
In the history of the German student, the author says, "Waters, all the same amendments."
"The load of the coffee, the like of the skin, the imitating of the gomy, the papers, the tree boxes."
He's still coming and describes the replacement of food in Germany.
It is reduced by the "mass made of lizzled river branched in the scooter (and fulfilled of false cooking from the tree), the tabaco of cutting corners and smooth brambors, bows with trees."
Remembers that there was "837 registred mass replacement in the production of parks and 511 registred coffee replacement".
Some story are about honor and integrity.
One of the Americans in themselves are internal decisions to divorce and brutality, which says about the war, "You finally understand that this is a human nature. No one sits in the agreed Christians with cigarettes and whisky, evening news or good books and shows that this mass represents civilization and that it is no barbars in the ground."
In addition, the British soldier knows that, with the greatest probability, he's dead, and nobody does not know it, but he's struggling.
"When a man finally suffers that he offers, he would expect at least that it would happen before the view of a thankful public," wrote.
Instead, it seems to be a "the judge which he has secretly shipped."
More notes are concerned with the department of the Old Europe and the implementation of new rates.
"The conflict has continued to be more economic counsel and competitive war," wrote Mr. Anglund, "the war between companies."
He discovered what he says "the new kind of animal in the next century: an explicit and ideologicly assaulted mass killer in clothes guarded on the peace that leads his blood and would not rise from the table."
People are just unexpected, the integrity is driving with herds.
Mr. England describes also the soldiers who were aware of the prostitute trying to take a major disease to get out of the front.
"The most biggest example of this behavior was the negotiation with a honococa henis that soldiers buyed and convinced it in the hope that it ends in the hospital," wrote.
"You're the most worthy of being cutting him in the eyes, which often has been smoking until the end of life."
In this translation of Sweden from Peter Graves, Mr. England's weak, but it doesn't show that it's a great thing to his human subject.
In the decades of detailed outputs, the way the war "with disappearable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate."
People's starting to ask why their leadership is to fight.
The best books about the first world war were most often more than with complex talks, such as "The Prime World War and modern Remember" from Paul Fussella or a country as "On West Bord" from Ericha Maria Remarquea.
Mr. England gives the presence of unconventional food.
His book has the most deceived conclusions that are popularly in the teaching literature.
But I'm not gonna betray him.
However, you will look like a single author to escape from the book, he will cut you a page from the list of herds out of the hand and burns it.

Nobody knew about the action, except some high officers, and the other was first said that he was being acting about the warning.
In the case of the action, the police commander Raymond W. Kelly, whose attitude was highlighted, had to have a policy department in the operation.
The cases of the past weeks were not able to be repeated, for example, to use pepper spreads against demonstrators, which was laid down the separation rules, and also the full public sympathies had passed on the side of squatters.
It was therefore a police operation that was to clean Zuccotti park from the demonstrators, starting up to two weeks of the continuous planning and exploitation.
The leading representatives were allowed to inspire operations in other cities.
The massive training for the case of behavior in crisis situations was in the part of Randalls Island, which was prepared for action in Zuccot park.
The leaders raised the taxed effort for disasters - antiterroristic measures with a quick movement of the great number of polices - with a town part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training was running on the evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Commands to move to the park came "for the last minute" to a person who was originally explained as "while".
"I know a couple of cops who were also invited to this action, and nobody said that he was going to Zuccotti park," said the person who just spoke with the condition that he remains in anonymous.
"It's what he's going to Zuccotti park, they knew only the highest position of the membership."
One of the reasons for the attack was the lecture that the city has already arrived once.
On October 14, the representatives of the city in the park plan had to clean up, but afterwards from the plan, because when they had received demonstrators, they were replaced before the start of operation to the park of hundreds.
Internal actions participated in policy from various units, including front groups of all areas - ten police members, which are usually used to distribute fourth with higher criminality.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day he comes to the park and reaches a large number of people, so one hour in the night was a ideal time when the action starts.
"It was appropriate to do it in time when it was at least people in the park," he said.
Before the units were expressed, they were located on the border of the Pike Slip Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, the busy cars with cloud lamps and amplions.
The light and replaced report from the amplions of many demonstrators were scared.
When the members of the order units entered into the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators have broken their things and departed.
The police says that until 1:45 morning, it was not the only state that she wanted to give the demonstrators the time to break up things.
Other policy teams were watched as they gathered together on the park border, so that they could get into it if it was necessary to carry out some interactions.
The reporters were cut down to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne said that it was for their safety.
However, many newspapers have the opinion that the police wanted to defeat them to see her units in the action, and also some policemans keep their groups.
Mr. Browne stated that the television cars on the Church Street leading the west border of the park could have achieved without problems.
The police went on to the west direction and spread up a huge measure of personal things that protested, including the guards and the sticks of full clothes, and they expressed a team of the hygiene division that immediately broke all that remained in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared a minute later on the Internet.
The most highest group of demonstrators came near the kitchen in their campaign that was near the middle of the park.
Some have created satarys and the police have started their methodical occupation.
Some ten people in the center of the campaign were attached together.
And two people were called to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the preparatory services were invited to retrieve the clusters.
Not until 3:30 in the park, Mr. Kelly reported.
The whole operation has been completed about 75 minutes later, the police has been expressed.
Mr. Browne said that 142 persons were arrested in the park.
The majority of the prisons has been carried out because of the "organization of efforts and resistance in the case of the exploitation", he explained.
The highest police officer in the place of action was Joseph J. Esposito, police officer, the highest uniformed officer for the section.
The operation also participated in Phil T. Pulaski, Detective Detective Officer.
Mr. Kelly was an advocate, but "I didn't share the operation's management," Mr. Browne said.
The second police group waited at the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, for the case it was necessary to allow it.
At the Cortland Street street, a block north from the park, and on the Pine Street street, a block from the south from the park, were involved.
Then the police developed a protective stairs from Zuccotti park.
In one place, the polices were visited, from which many were saved ships, how people are still extracted for this border.
At the north border, there were almost 28 persons.
The most amazing night actions have passed from the park.
At the fifth hour of the morning, one demonist was seen from Pine Street, as he went out to the police car head, and some others who escaped air from the pneumatic policy additives.
One minute, he went out of the damage.
At the end of the operation, one police and one protestant was hospitalized.
The department of the employees will request the town for the release
In the middle of the centuries of school workers who have come to work, they have planned to invite the city, and they say that the permission was not necessary, and also departed on discrimination, because of the unreasonable impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court is probably the last options that remains in the District Council's field of 37, in their cases to revoke the prohibition decision.
On September, the work was lost six hundred seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were looking at the front of the most placed employment of the city. Their remission of members of the officers described as a payment of the city for that the municipes were not allowed to access the Health of Working Readers by which the city would like to give thanks to the decision.
The representatives of the cities have rejected this commitment.
On the implementation of the citizen advice that was last month, Dennis M. Walcott said that the expenditure was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately checked that there was no particular discussion in the budget on the prohibition of assistant workers.
The representatives of the town part of the District Council 37 stated that they had already fulfilled the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of School that they would ask it, and in the middle of the pressing conference, which formally announce the request in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
In the process, Mr. Walcott and the Ministry will be charged, while the requesting side will be eight forbidden workers from which all are African or Spanish, as well as most of the other assistants who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the law of the city, said that the city wasn't yet seen, and that's why it's not going to be a single accusation.
According to the proposal of the wealth of New York Times, the campaigns were assigned to a number of forbidden in the poor parts of the cities, as they wanted to support their statement on wrong actions. They still think that the poor schools have come on more assistance, because they have already rejected sufficient financial environments.
They show that while in schools in the Staten Island part of schools, the Upper East Side was not achieved, and in the part of Upper East Side only at the minimum, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 in Brownsville, the work of 17 school assistants and in the District 8 and 9 parts in South Bronx was forbidden even 46 assistants.
Remembers that in the school of the Public School 36 in Harlema has lost five of the eight assistants, although it is about school where 68% students live in poverty. It says, "It's not about the neighborhood of the full moved parents who can build financial funds to make a budget."
The rate of the Public School 36 was reduced by 3,26 per cent and the school also came to the money when the city changed the way to calculate the bonus funds for each income student.
In addition to other cases, the directors of the Mediterranean School may be discharged by the way it was written by the document approving the forewitting of parents coordinators.
The word "excess" was used in the document to describe the "excess", therefore to interrupt the position, although this word often uses to describe a teacher from the payment list of schools to the database of available workers, which the ground is cut off from the central authority.
"Seventy-six parents' coordinators were released," stated in the proposal, "and nothing was only moved to the database on the position of available workers."
The mission is at the end, the Congres is ready to accept a agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that Republic and Democratics in the Congress are agreed with something about the resurrection in Libya.
However, before it arrived, the revolution had to be reached, the Government Dictor Muammar Kaddafi had to be arrested and killed and participated in the United States units.
The Commission for international relations of the Senate will decide on the explanation of the President John Kerry (Mass.) together, Senators John McCainam (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which the Liberians should welcome their successful resurrection of the United States Units to thank "stability".
"This statement we want to appreciate the respect of the people of Libye who started with the rebuilding of their country," said Kerry.
"The two sides of the political spectrum would like to express the support of their democratic trials."
The mentioned periods may seem innocent, but no debat that was concerned with Libye until it was not yet easy.
During the year, the lawyers of both parties were not permanently agreed between themselves and the White House on the indication of a series of statements to approval or reject the military role of the United States in the mission of NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain replied the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in Snimov because of the various opinions of both political parties, so it was never talking about it in Senat.
However, on the day when this proposal was rejected, the Commission denied and measures that would stop financing American operations in Libya.
Thus, the United States mission in Libya was worthy of the legislative purchase - the Congress crisised the way President Obama missions lead, but his members were obviously unreasoned to stop supporting him in his beginning.
At the end of the congress' hate, another event has been presented.
The Rebels in August arrived by Tripolis and 20 October was killed by Kaddafi.
Miss Nato was officially finished on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for international relations in its statement "gratulations to the citizens of Libya for their increasing respect and wonderfulness that they have made in order to liberate their people" and "Great men and women of armed forces of the United States and their associations who have entered into the operation on the protection of the Liberian Civil Protection, for a regular statement and professionalist."
In the statement, "the national interest of the United States is also ensuring a successful and unnecessary transition to the Democracy in Libya."
Does the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the lawyers be divided again at two half, as it had been approved by the Red proposal?
The last version was established by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republic parties in the Commission.
Lugar's speaker on the Sunday said that he's still not seen the final version of the new proposal.
In this week, this week will be voted on addition to the Act, which would require an exhaust budget, which should be the highest legislative priority at least all of the Republic and Democratics in the Congress.
These measures, proposed by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Statute on the budget or the other subject that will vote to the whole Snimovna or Senat.
Other lawyers have not yet made their proposals to pronounce themselves.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of the 68 additives that were presented in the Congress, and were involved in the largest theme of various themes.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to Snimov and Senat - and others are only of the detailed variables of others.
Only in Snimovn, you can find at least 15 versions of the corrected budget and another ship that would like "regular federal costs".
Some of the proposals are even true, but their residents - especially the republics who want to improve the news - can be praised by their "autority".
The expenditure of the budget rules approved in August requested to vote to Snimovna and Senat on the addition of the balanced budget.
In March 58, the senators voted in the use of an independent declaration on support of such additives.
In addition to the budget, several members want to establish and limit the number of periods in which Member States may serve the Congress, while Joseph E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in the function of the President.
The Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole number of additions that would others make the right to quality education and medical care.
The sustainable proposal remains an additive to prohibit marriage of couples of the same heading and the additive to prohibit the state balls.
Some lawyers also want to allow to cancel federal laws in the case of two third countries against them.
However, the members of the Congress are in the proposal of various additives very active, however, in comparison with the previous years, they do not explicitly excited.
In 111, the Congress offered 77 additives, while 100. The Congress was 66.
Their activity is even in comparison with the beginning of the 20th century when the members of the Senatory Library had offered more than 150 additives each year.
However, they were not more successful than the current policy.
The last addiction was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, however, the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Mighty, but not easy," says Guyord in his first television conversation from the shooting
Ten months after she was in the middle neighbourhood, a shooting on a public meeting with a volatory in Tucson, Gabrielle Guifords (Ariz.) on the evening on the evening, she was singing together with the melodie of the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and she told that more about return to the Congress is to be healthy.
Guyords appeared in order "20/20" at the ABC News Station with Diane Sawyer. It was to see that the creation of her creation still makes problems and she needed help at the time.
The entire order documented her difficult reconversation, which was required for the proposal of the formed cycle that split her before the lamb, broke the left half brain, and then she went out of her head out.
Three months ago, she was surprisedly returned to Snemovna to participate in triumphally with the vote of a deep strip.
At his first television interview from a year-day fire, when six persons were killed and 13 others were destroyed, the Guiords had smiled, smiled, and singed - because her repeating described as "in difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she feels, she replied to the 13-year-old Guyords, "It's good."
The conversation with Guiords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kellym, was part of the time special part of the "20/20", which was sent in the presidency of the new books of this Party, with the name "Gabby: Award and hope".
The Special observed the whole reconverseness of Guiord from the fire of 8 January.
In videos that touched Kelly during the first week, it is to see him in the hospital bed with his head broken, and to see him over the whole roof.
While her husband rebuilds her, she can't be more than one or two pieces in that time.
A few months later, the Guyords is arrested as he sits in a cold cross and therapeuts teaches her how to do simple activities.
Hiding the head.
Putting out the mouths.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, the Guyords spoke another word - "toast" when she required changes in her dinner.
Videos from ABC show that the hard work to repeat the Guiords game: The Congress of them can sing a terapeute on the melodie to the write "Girls Just Just Wanna Have Fun" from Cyndi Laupers and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
In the conversation of Guiord, which leads two hours to therapy day, the Sawyer advised that from the day when he came to the shooting, he remembers nothing.
Her husband said that the Guiord had read the new articles about the fire until 12 March when she first asked him who was the sixth, who was killed in the accident.
From the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is arrested in the prison in Missouri, where violently given medicines are waiting for the judicial process.
"He died a lot of people," said the Guyords Sawyer.
"Work, horrible, horrible."
Kelly Sawyer advised that his wife in the reconvalisence said, "I've been playing."
"So I said to her immediately, Gabby, you didn't play," described Kelly.
"You've got a laptop.
But you can do that, you'll get together and get back stronger than ever."
The military units are often met with respect than with respect
This event was a Gallagher on Wall Street, who brought millions of dollars for military veterans in New York, who don't have a threat over his head.
Kid Rock singed a balance of disastrousness, frustration and loss.
There were hundred soldiers, mariners, flyers and mariners around him.
The slowly clothed dawn rose up and pressed excitingly.
"Muses also served in the army were considered a hero," said David Saltzman, who ordered a garden benefit.
In addition to him, Mike Mullen, who had seen the role of military units in any way.
"All were represented as a seroot," wrote the officer in e-mail.
I'm sure the organizators think that's good.
I know that's right.
Just what I saw wasn't honored.
Thus, in fact, the receptions only illustrate an increasing relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes glorious American publicity.
The soldier is unprecedented by honor for his victims.
It's just that honour is something that says the soldiers.
The public is still more smoking as a single in the uniform.
"We are not victims," said the brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who is a lot of units in Iraq and quickly leaves African.
"It seems to be the only way that some can support us is to put us into the role of painful souls."
This subject is very sensitive for armed leaders who don't want to look in grateful or show relations with the public service.
They also recognize that the anger that they had to fulfill the units returning from Vietnam was much worse.
The result of this is that most of the words of distress are pronounced in silence and in particular between military veterans.
When the two sons of the Pensionary Plenum Mark Canciana returned from the battle actions where they served as the members of the Sea, their father warned that people will be looking for their service outside the army.
In view of some will feel respect and amazing because they hit enemies and visited exotic places.
Others, but it's going to cut off his head, "if it's unclean bad, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the fights in Iraq and after returned, he took place in Washington in the government.
He said that when he was looking for a job, some people who had talked with him were unexpectedly indicated whether soon after he returned to the battle can get the stress that is connected to work in Washington.
"When you are talking about your service, you have to count the negative reactions," taught Cancian his sons.
The worst of the army is partly worried from the American illness to wars.
The efforts on the battle field are only sometimes able to recognize in the country that has only a small conscience of its own army, and in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are only a little own effort.
"As a nation, we don't have a military army, as it was normal for the second world war," announced the general reporter David Barno, who was larger to the American units in Afganistan.
Instead of recognition of political and publicity, the mainly focuses on the suffering of men in the weapons.
The soldiers are identified as the number of actions they have overcome, the number of friends who have lost or for their consent.
The army's head of growth pressure to steal against depression
This week will be decided whether the court process 28 women and men against the army will be initiated because of the independence in the case of disagreement.
If not, the request is prepared to provide hundreds of other representatives.
The first chariot of Elizabeth Lyman was in the night when his colleague was delicately disappointed from the army, 25 years and was on the 11th week.
It happened in October 2008, and she turned into a cascar on the air base of Miramar north from San Diega. After evening, her friend took her boyfriend with 12 drinks.
She asked her if she could connect to her that she could be a little drinking at the room.
"In my head I've lighted a wonderful light," said Lyman.
Only the family of Texasan ignored her instructions.
I thought he was 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"If I listen to my instincts."
She says that just a few minutes after they entered her room, a man went to her, rolled her on the bed and threw her down.
This week, 18 November, will Liman and 27 other staying or ancient army members wait for the height of hearing that could have historical impact. This will be issued in Arlington in Virginia, and it will be about whether the accusation against the ex-minister of Robert Gates and his president Donald Rumsfeld will be made before the judgment.
In the accusation, Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to fight the extent of the extent of the army, which is in contrast with the rights of military.
The accusation was provided in the office by the Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the requesting side was at that time 17 members. However, during the following months, their number was grown at 28 - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were infected or sexually attacked their colleagues in the army and that the army of the notification of these attacks had failed in the investigation, condemnation and any honour.
Burke says that he's on the top of the army's officers, because the problem's just beginning with them.
"The army is a directive system," says.
"Who are the people who are in the position that they can be able to prevent measures against such acts?"
Burke also states that he contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, of which many of them could be part of other requirements given in the future.
Her strategy: Besides to cut all offences in this case - she put all the birds into one cow, as he says -- she gives a question in various cases, if it needs not to smoke the press.
The State Leader of the United States of Neil MacBride, who made the co-operators to reject the case.
The Court of Newsweek has received a detailed newsweek strategy - in principle, the current or ancient soldiers can not ask the army for a disaster that has suffered as a member of armed forces.
According to the Supreme Court Regulation from 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the destruction of the military in the active service.
"The reward of military services of requests," writes in the document.
The Ministry's defence was refused to express it.
However, the winds have been changed since 50 years.
Although women still do not have to serve officially in the fight, it is only a wording: in modern wars it is only difficult to find clearly given front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the groups of women's soldiers played more explicitly, especially in the community with civil women in the military area.
Result: between these wars, 150 soldiers of women's head - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time to come to modernization and to the army, explain Burke.
It's not alone in his fight, but it's in the case of three other legal leaders.
At the legal school, Yale's visitors of the Veteran Seminars are prepared for four major military academy for the development of women supporting hatred atmospheres.
Independently, the non-existent American veteran organization collects the bases for their claims to be attached against the army. This request is measured on the diagnosis of the "personality" diagnosis, which was fully detected in the victims of defense, to have the army for their desolation - according to activityists, such as Anu Bhagwati's assistant to the group of fighters for human rights of Women's Action Network.
The group has already submitted a proposal for a request against the State organization for the treatment of veterinarians, which is committed by discrimination practices, to which the requests of assisting from the parties stated that they were sexually attacked in the service.
In the Congress, nine other proposals were presented, which had submitted a group of senators and messengers from both political parties and proposed in them a series of real measures.
According to the officer for prevention and decision of the Ministry ' s violation, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains in most cases unexpected and in accordance with Pentagon’s own disorders, this number corresponds approximately to 13,5 per cent of the 19,000 accidents in which the year has occurred.
The report published in March is also deployed by the measure of criminal offences: In 2010, 20% of the cases in the army were reached to the Court in 2010, which is half against the civil legal system.
In the case of Burke's officers describe the attacks just as the first of the whole row to traumate.
For example, Lyman's first class, for example, announced the details of the military police for an hour after what he had to do.
During the night, it was requested to repeat the detailed detail on its detailed detail to the policy, doctors and officers.
All investigations needed to be determined and in her bed were found by the blood of the assassin - from the wrath that she made him on the ground.
At six months later, April 2009, Lyman solved the hearing of Lyman before the court in which the question was based on whether she loved her friend in the day of attack.
Seven persons were invited as witnesses of the report in the benefits of the fulfillment of the faithful one who was finally reproached.
"I remember the day when the judgment was issued," says Lyman.
"I felt that I was right there in the place of my birth -- with a cry I went out of the court's street."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I've said to my officer, "I wasn't his judge, it was my."
The Lymans ordered to visit the military psychiater who finally diagnosed a person’s disorder, which marked it as unemployable to serve.
In January 2010, the army was released without honor and thus without an excuse.
If the case of Lyman and other prisoners is going to get to another phase or not, it's a long train, says John Turley, Professor of the Pravn University of George Washington.
He notes, of course, "It's my point of view that they should be able to attach to other phases of advancement."
However, between them and the virus are a significant doctrine which was criticized from the first time, which has seen the light of the world.
I'm alone a global criticism of the Doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their obligations are not allowed to maintain the same measure of motivation and fearing measures.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them, but it's important for them to try it."
To change, it will only happen when good people will fight.
If there is no decision to hear in their efforts, Burkevoa, an attorney of the applicants, will gather hundreds of other persons who are prepared to give a request and begin to work on other challenges concerned with this subject.
"We're not gonna stop the army in this question to fight from where it's not going to reform," says.
Or until we die, according to what happens before.
The walls have eyes: how scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of a real extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his prospective views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was admitted to the Red murder, after being left in Norway 77 dead, participated in his first public audience.
Although Breivik could act himself, in the cyber-pross, he was decisively amazing: during the preparation of an attack, he had a lot of time at the computer, chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting legal groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of the air year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
Just how to find them?
It's easy - it's enough to express Facebook.
"We realized that it is not really so difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author recently published the reports of the British Research Team, which was concerned with the European digital population.
The basis of the personal information on Facebook is so common, says Bartlett that the scientists have enough to use the reklame on pages and to make it easy to determine the demographic group - something that marketing workers do for the whole year.
The Bartlett team, for example, found half of millions of right fans groups, and they took attention to them, and sent them inzerates, but instead of their environment to call them into a new developer group or to offer them some dial products, called them to fulfill the questionnaire in which the issues were issued on their level of education, relationship with violence and optimism to their own future.
With the Facebook with Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 fans of 14 different legal groups in 11 European countries were able to get out of the office.
"It's totally a new way to carry out research," states Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprised: on-line hundreds of the right groups are most young men who declare the growth of advancement.
But on the other hand, "the ones who combine their online activists also with off-line activity are smarter, democratic and less violent than those who remain on the screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is only one of the examples as Facebook becomes a new tool in the hand of scientists.
Research teams, healthy scientists and political researchers of these pages are used to study all, from health problems even after social trends hiding status updates, training on walls and pressing buttons "I love."
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each day of them provides three different data from this social network, which makes a "Information Supernew", which is in developing many new researchs. The number of academic works in which the name is the name of Facebook has grown up to five years ago.
For some scientists, the Facebook's twice in the way he gives them the opportunity to study people without to have to disturb them somewhere on the street.
"Before, it was paid that if you wanted to carry a research between people of the British national parties, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the side where they would never leave you," says Bartlett.
"This is all this Facebook, you just go right to them."
Others say that the page will provide a way to identify society and health problems and get out of them.
In the recent study of Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, a research team discovered that university students who developed their field outputs on Facebook were more raised by the problem of alcoholism than students who discussed this subject.
Moren proposes to monitor and come with a contribution to the student who publishs too many opile states.
"The problem is not to resolve if you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, a copy of Dr. Moren and Director of Health, Health and Development of Children in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify the worried children that we shouldn't have a chance to find."
Facebook provides the data of its users in the last time.
The information team made statistics relating to the conformity of relationship situations and the day of S.V. Valentine, the election participation in 2010 and the coefficient of the people's satisfaction (privately with the use of information to have access to the Internet freedom has already been said that the page should access its information base to the investigation and others).
But the Facebook users know that it's a page looking for them to like it or not - they're changing to play Scrabble with a friend who's a thousand miles away, it's necessary to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users are part of the research they don't know?
The scientists have clearly limited rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data are available to each one.
"After most of the users, I didn't believe that scientists could see their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociolog in London Knowledge Lab, about a study from 2006, which was conducted with the use of public facebook walls of their students.
"If it was about them, they took it so that they were only information between them and their friends."
Finally, it is also to consider the question of methodology.
In the study of off-line, there is no conclusion that the subject is just honest.
Facebook can't check how large parts are information on profile and articles on real walls.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook, these are two very different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has trained the research of new technologies for years, thinks that the hard and the writer remains the best possible tool that can use in the research.
"When you are going to speak to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," says.
"A company research should be on society and social activities - and a lot of social activities is still offline."
"Freed and neutral": Anders Behring Breivik is participating in his first public court translation
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who agreed to reach two attacks during the year in Norway, killed 77 people, during his first public court hearing in Osla himself as a fighter of "beat".
"I am a military leader in Norway's resistance and between northern temple rulers," he announced before the judge where 500 people were gathered together.
"I appreciate the aid against the court, because the mandator has made you an organization that supports the ideology and supports multiculturalism."
"I know my deeds, but I don't accept any guilty for them."
The Court Torkjel Nesheim Breivik stopped during this monologe because "he didn't want to give Brevik the opportunity to use this hearing as a podium of which he could report his opinions."
Since the same reason he refused to Breviko who brought a word prepared with himself, allowed to finally listen to offer his relative victims.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Breivika in the respect of the next 12 weeks, ordered to him any medium with 4 weeks and announced that the authorities will have a full control over all his visits and all correspondences after eight weeks.
The hearing has been involved at about 30 relative victims and survivors.
Some have come in the hope that they can look at Brevik's eyes, others because they're sure they are held under the cluster.
They all participated in the purpose of moveing the case to close a degree.
"I seemed that he looked cold and neidly," said the NRK commenter one of the living attacks.
"I wasn't nice, but I can say for myself that after what I saw and heard of the surprise, I was psychically raised a little further."
Brevik, in the dark cloud and blue cravate, remained all the time to hear peaceful and professional. When you come and go to the building without difficult to look at the present journalists and survivors in the eyes.
In the middle of Brevik, it is a major part of the "report", the judge stated that it was not crazy, and he recognized that there was no evidence that he had a partner.
For someone can be encouraged that the attacks of June 22 seem to be working on the only extremists and any radically groups.
However, it does not reduce the smokes and the smokes that are still in minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I'd like to look like a creature that's not like," said the relative one of the victims.
"If yes, it would be much easier."
7 Learning from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a film to kid this week
As Steve Jobs died in October 5., people who compared him with Henry Ford began to find out the views of the world, and chose him for his genital to the most modern inventory.
At the recent renewed Job's conversation, which was issued for special films that are in this week, Apple's famous companies will be the fact that its creative mind has completely understood commercial processes and workshops for its products.
He was a wonderful designer, snow and self-named member of the hippie, but also a pedant organizator and a person who had every debt of men in the less detail - he believed that many businessmen were threatening "the fact that the real idea is of 90 per cent of their work... [but] between the good ideas and the Committee's Final Product is still a long way of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the Triumf series of computers, who declared the use of personal computers. At the time of the exploitation, it was a uniform than more than a time conversation.
At that time, it was ten years since Jobs had taken to leave Apple company, and he had full hands of work with his new computer company NeXT, and he was unfortunately looking at how wide publicity we accept the Internet.
In the order TV, only a short part of the entire Cringely’s conversation was used and on original interview copies had been trained that they were lost during the transport.
However, shortly after Job's death, the VHS copies were found in the register guarantee.
Just this material, increasingly secured, creates a base of 68 minutes of Steve Jobs: Dead interview, which is able to be selected in this middle and fourth.
To someone who requested his desire to provide greater discussions, Jobs will be surprised that he can consider his technological philosophy and trade strategys.
And it also appears to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the conversation will be that between the question and the answer will be more pause - 10 to 15 seconds thinking when I see how Job's response is perfectly thinking to be the most highest and the best.
They appear to the moments when Job's perfectionalism on the plane, when at Cringely's questions are indulgently and encouraging him to make it quickly to the most important problems and the subjects.
The conversation was still attached before the ear Pixaru, iPod or iPhone, and it appears to be a terrible prophecy, when Jobs values what other companies do well and badly, providing their own future visions on the field of computer techniques.
One thing is to read the dead evaluation of Job's carriers, but to Job, which we see here as a deep sneeper in his geniality, is something serious and inspirative.
He has his own visions of how they can and have to look like.
It was a long time, and after his thoughts, he also started to go into the practice.
Quickly coordinated seven scenes of the lost interview, which are decided to notify:
How he learned to guide the company:
"In the years of business, I always asked, "Why do you do this?" and the answer was always the same, "Well, so it's just doing it."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, never think of things about business doesn't go into depth.
I found it.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to renew accounting in Apple company.
He was just disappointed by the way costs were called - often started with the "standard costs", on their higher, and in that moment he decided to express his own path - developed automatic tools, which had recommended that the trade costs could be determined during a minute.
As he made a roshman on the path:
Jobs reminds the "Modroe crabs", which constructed with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to be efficiently attached to the phone society and to call freely anywhere in the world.
The device was already written in the past, but Job's overseer, when the Blue box describes as power tools, is excited.
Tells how the Device tested with the placed phone, and during the conversation, they were not allowed to reconnect from one AT & T network to another, while they used the largest number of satellites.
"Now, at least half twenty times, we went around the world, so when we cried something to the place phone, it was called a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs suspected.
"We were young and we discovered that we can assemble something that is able to guide the infrastructure for billions of dollars throughout the world."
The same two we made a small thing that could control a lot of greater work -- it was an incredible experience, and I would never destroy Apple company without it.
Jobs continues the description of the smoke that he had at least arrived to the end. In the middle of the Blue Club in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked whether they could talk to the Paper, as well as what they had been best done for Henry's Kissinger.
The church members of the Catholic church were on the right hand to speak in the middle of the night with the American diploma, and at least before they built up the phone and the phone, two of them were discharged and listened.
How he loved the technology (and called with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, he knew a replacement to make a kilometer, he found a phone number on Bill Hewlett and called him.
A long time after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had already secured an airport in Hewlett-Packard company.
"It was the only company I met in that time, and she formed my view on what this company is, and how to keep his employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer that had been produced."
He was big as a coffee, he had a CRT monitor and I loved him immediately.
As a teenager I went up and high in the HP, I flowed around the computer and started write programs for him.
How the innovations are thinking:
In some areas of Jobs during the conversation, they talk about how they think of new products.
At the beginning of his carrier, when he was sold a couple of deceases with a lot of connections, one of his lawyers asked him to set a whole computer together for him.
There was only 30 payment days in which he had to consider, mount and add ready devices.
When he was later in Apple company, she remembers the problems that were discussed when the computer mouse was developed:
"I remember how we've been very divorced... they cried to me that it would remain five years [the Mouse that would stand 300 USD] until I stopped to buy it, I went out and found a designer."
At ninety days later, we could produce a perfect low mouse for 15 USD.
How much a big company says you:
A long time before Apple's resurrection, Jobs predicted a widely that many industry leaders in his visibility involving and losing their participation on the market.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox company, so you're doing better copies or printers, well and what's going on?"
You have a monopol market, so the company can't be successful.
In this moment, there will be already government for residence and marketing, so the companies lead to people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned with their own products are exhausted from the decision process.
Technological genius that carried out to her indecent position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - the exploitation and technical knowledge are necessary.
It just happened in the Xerox company...
The Xerox society could properly own the complete computer industry.
He could have been ten times greater than it, he could be Microsoft's ninety years...
Yet, in place of winning, they were made to win.
How to innovate as a form of mystery:
"Besides a great idea and a great resulting product is still a long way and a lot of work, and as this great idea is, it also changes and grows."
At that time, you're learning much about him.
You have to approach the whole series of compromises - specific things just electronic, balls, robots or business do not connect.
You have to have 5000 things to remember - different concepts - and make them together...
Finally, you are trying to think about the best things that have been created by mankind, and in some way you're trying to steal to do what you do yourself.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, but the best artists will go back.
I've never been afraid that I had the best ideas.
The Macintosh community was so wonderful and successful because people who worked in it were a wonderful musicians, crazy artists, artists, zoologists, history and conventions, even the best computer experts in the world.
Unless computers and new technologies, they would prove wonderful things in the full of other products.
Scalia and Thomas fed with the law on health care during their cases
On the day when the Supreme Court has seen at the closed doors to address the political contrary question, if we take an advice against the law on the health care of President Obamy, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in the celebration of the Honoured Legal Company, which will be involved before the Court of Treaty.
To the event, the last fourth, when all nine judges had come to discuss the proposals.
One of the proceeded cases was made a request for 26 States to prevent radically processing health care, which was approved by the Congress, a law that promoted concert activities throughout the world.
The judges agreed to listen to the claim, but in March, 5 hours are expected that the results of the results will further develop the President's choices planned for 2012 and the decision will be completed.
It will be Paul Clement, who served as the General Procureur of the United States for the Government of George W. Bushe.
Clement's legal company, Bancroft PLLC, was one of at least two company tattoos that helped to spooler the periodic party of the Federalist Society's group, which has been occupied for a long year.
Another company, Jones Day, is employed by one of the commercial companies of the laws concerned, such as the National Federation of Independent Affairs.
The next sponsor was Pfizer Inc pharmaceutical gigant, for which they are in the process of a large financial environment.
The evening was done in the Washington hotel for a few hours after the court discussion on the subject of the case.
He participated with her, except others, including Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed the law on health care.
And the hosts' guidance?
It's not a new thing: These two judges are the actions of the Federalist Society participating for years.
And it doesn't matter anything that would be in contrast with ethical rules.
In fact, these judges are invited to maintain the principles of conduct that are under the lower federal courts.
However, if it was not, their behavior would have fallen under principle C4, which says that "the judge can participate in actions that are just relevant and other organizations in order to reach financial instruments, but the judge should not be a speaker, honorable host, or should not be applied to the action programme."
However, the relationship of Scalii and Thomas to two legal companies in the case, and also with a large financial interest in this case, was sufficient to warn the activities that call for the government.
"This exciting threat of ethics and devotion against the code of behavior is in contrast with several judges that the highest court is conducted in accordance with the same rules that pay for all other federal courts," announced Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause Organization.
"The judges have drinked and celebrated social benefits together with laws who wait for the exercise of their case before the judge."
Their presence and aid to get financial measures through this action subtracts the feet of all disagreements that are inacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas, their critical criteria, showed only understanding and told them that they also combinate their judicial responsibilities with the group actions, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high concert activist.
In addition, the concerts believe that the ethical problem has principally the court of Elena Kagan and none of Scalia and Thomas.
The Kagan worked as a general procureur for the Government of President Obama when the first actions were made against the law.
The crisis of Kagan presses her to be involved in the case, and says that at the time the law was fighting so much than it could not be now deceived.
Kagan wasn't declared that he could get out of here.
Boeing Community has received a record law on the travel airport in 18 billion USD
Aerolinks Emirates consist of 50 two-level product airports Boeing 777 with the possibility of buying 20 others.
The Boeing company also sold six years of Boeing Dreamliner airlines Aman Air, for which insects more than 1 billion USD.
When some company gets a convention on 50 pieces of its products, most of it is not a reason for a milk.
However, if this company's aeroplane Boeing Co. and the price of those 50 airports makes a total of 18 billion records of USD, it's something different.
The same important report is also where Boeing has received the law: the Middle East, developing the gold deal for the future aircraft.
According to the proposals issued in the Chicag’s Sunday, the airlines at the Central East will be required by 2 520 years in $450 billion USD in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced his largest participation in the history, which relates to the dollar values for the commercial airport - 50 two-leading product Boeing 777.
The Sunday Law has come from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
Boeing community on the room 2011 Dubai Air Show made that airlines have the possibility to buy more 20 airlines, thanks to the total value of the insurance was spread for 26 billion USD.
On Monday, the Boeing company announced that the Oman Air aerolinks had six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes called as Dreamliner, who were extremely better consumption of pipes and passengers.
The total price of these six years is over 1 billion USD.
"It's a wonderful report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analysis for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many aircrafts at the Middle East are the most secret nations of food.
It means that they have not only money for the payment of the aircraft, but the increase of prices of the flows - the major aerolines, because it's one of their largest costs - it's not so determined because the land is solemn on high prices.
It's important because they are not likely to be in other aircrafts, that they may be able to build or deposit aircrafts because of the higher price of the pile, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," says.
The law from Emirates airline approves Boeaing's leader position on the market with a wide trip and brings to the airbus SAS companies that were trying to discharge the dominant company of Boeing with its A350 transport model.
Boeing company's victory comes four months after Airbus officers announced that the first plane of their largest A350, which is a direct concurrent airport 777-300ER.
The manufacturer took time to add the machines to a larger power of the motor.
Boeing Co Action Price increased 1,5% to 67,94 USD.
The sister of the Mexican President was in the case of all Mikoacan options.
Louisa Maria Calderon says that her advocat, Faust Vallejon, from PRI, helped the gubernamental cross-productor with drugs in honour.
The sister Felipe Calderona seems to have been played in violent state options on government posts in Michoacan. In the next month, one of her adversaries intend to win drugs.
Preliminary results have been attached to guidelines in the Government Options of the West State of Faust Vallejo from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The causes of members of the organizated crime to the whole election process, and especially in the last day choices are alarming not only for Michoacan, but for our whole country," said Louisa Maria Calderon in the conversation for the radio day after week options.
"There were warned to our candidates, the members of the groups for the research of public deficits, they broke the choices, built a powerful shield, and let people vote to the PRI.
The PRI page ruled in Mexico seven decades until the year 2000 when the Presidency came.
However, it plans a cruel return to the power and victory in the choices in Michoacan is a important step.
The PRI page hopes that it will win in June in the President's choices.
It seems that Vallejo smoked Calderon, who's leaving a day before the choices, was just very smoking.
Calderon, a candidate for a concert part of his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as a wine.
Thirdly, Silvano Aureolis, candidate on the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which still controled the Government Office. For the launched and excessive successful part, the President's elections in 2012 are very difficult.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the provisional results for valid.
Vallejo, an elder of the main city of the State named Morelia, any relationship with the consumer of drugs rejects and chooses other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan was a long time controlled by drug carts specialising marihuana, heroin and metamfetamine.
One of the family states of President Calderon and just in Michoacan in 2006 began military war against the purchasers.
However, the poverty has survived.
An elder from the PAN side, Captain Louisy Marie Calderon, was murdered only weeks before choices and many candidates departed from the choice of fear.
Nevertheless, the results of the elections in Michoacan appear to be for the PRI side, the victory will help you get a new impulse.
The expected leader of PRI in president's choices, Enrique Pena Nieto, welcomed from Waington Vallejo and said, "I think this victory could be very excited in the past year."
ADB Bank calls Asia to help save the Eurozone
Bank Asian Development Bank called India and China to be prepared to be prepared to save the Eurozone before its serious debt crisis, otherwise, it would be possible to achieve the whole world economy that would have negative impact in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the General Director of the ADB, with a seat in Manile, said that two quickly developing economics in the world must "deal everything in their forces" to help the rapid return of the currency block through the International Monetary Fund, or the right two agreements.
He warned that the States of Bric [Brasilia, Russia, India, China] follow all European difficulties "except unabsolved" and announced that asylum's financial assistance in combination with European leadership and means will help the long-term overcome of global economy.
"We're all together."
"So everyone who could help Europe from the crisis," said for the Financial Times during talking on the World Economic Forum in Bombai.
"Asia may be protected in a certain way, but it's absolutely not immunity."
"So if China and India can help, they should have done it."
The European Mines Board has already been tested several months of a serious crisis.
At the last days, Italia's expenditure costs were dangerously attached and the President governments of Italy and Greece departed.
The growth of debt crisis in Europe was afraid that the world's economy could be reloaded again to the research, and began to find the calls to achieve the new rearching white economy and helped Eurozone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed by the IMF, but noted that the rebounded aid - as the purchases of the Fund's financial assistance of the European Union, institutions for the European Financial Statution - that the Assembly partners of the European countries would provide greater exclusion.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Ministry of Trade, said, "India will do what will be powerful," to help Eurozone, because her own economy is now suffering by the export and disappearing of the foreign capital.
"Nobody wants to stay instable and instable Eurozone," he said.
"We're standing before a hard task and we have to keep the high peace of growth."
"It's not about the alternative, it's about a hot fact because we could find a job for ten millions of our young men and women."
Others believe that the economies, such as those Indians, do not have anything to help European economys when they are nucted to share their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of the Brown University in the United States said that it would be politically difficult to explain aid for Europe for 1,2 billion people in India when 800 million of them lives from 2 USD or less on the day.
"There would be able to find that the Greeks go to the passenger in the fifty-fifty-old, and they would have used them on the ships, which might have been hard to explain to them," he noted.
Lee Howell, the General Director of the World Economic Forum, often understood why Indian resources should be used to maintain good pleasant employment for many Greek citizens in the bad and loss sectors, such as the fertilization right.
Mr. Nag showed that the Eurozone crisis was threatened by the dangerous domain effect.
The proposal of banks that in Asia, between 2011/2012, will be 7,5% of the economic growth, now is the "risic of the pool" caused by the European threat.
He reported that the rare development of markets must create "plans of non-profit expenditure" to be protected before the episode and explicit deliver of the capital from their economy.
Warning from Pentagon on the potential defence area
The Minister of Protection of Leon Panetta in the Monday in the Congress has regularly added under the chain, when he warned that the automatic scars in the budget may be able to prevent national security and to choose financial string reactions starting in Pentagon and continued through battle in Afganistan to civil mounting lines.
Pentagon will now have to reduce the budget of 450 billion USD during the next ten years, however, now the reduction of more than 600 billion USD is reached if the Congress does not close the agreement on the expenditure.
"The impacts of these shoes would be for the whole resort destroying," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the incapableness of the Congress has been achieved to the agreement on the budget and from the taxed provisions of 23% of the pupils and the end of many new projects.
"Because so severe reduction, using this unreasonable way, the majority of our design or ship projects will not be able to buy only three four four buildings or ships. Moreover, it would be possible to be a serious blessing of other modernization opportunities," wrote the Senators.
"When we have to share many of our civilian employees, and as we have to reduce so quickly, we also need to have at least certain civilization to send to the nucleus allowance to be able to fulfil the target requirements."
"These changes can take up with the faith of those who take care of our army and make it seriously prepared."
Finally, the scars are touched and battle units, he told Panetta.
"If the accounts for financing possible military operations in the field are not directly undertaken, the closer operations will be negatively affected by the serious changes in other budgets," advised Mretta.
"It's going to cut off and in the contractual personnel, which will be followed by the following contracts that support the military efforts of our people."
"The employees will be reduced by the employees of which they will also pay for the additives and the following disappearance of law and political support."
Both Senators received Panett ten days ago and asked him about the details of possible impacts on the automatic defence of the Ministry.
"The results of the areas on the Ministry of Defence could make a rapid degradation of views in the United States as to the world military power."
"We are strictly against this severe measure," the senators announced in the common statement on Monday, when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not about the end we could live, and we're not going to sign under it."
"The planned scars are severe for the National Security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"Therefore it is seen whether Panetet's letter and warning increases the pressure on the Congress approving the budget and sending voices to leave Pentagon from the list of covered areas.
Panetta was in the last time in the talks of the potential smokes more open, although he had gone to his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of budgets in the Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was disappeared into a huge battle.
On the print conference on the week of the ministry, the Ministry of the Protection has marked a struggle image of what he can wait for - the army's army's board, however, in which the nuclear will be missing.
"I'll be like a ship without the sea."
"It's gonna be like a brigade without munition."
"It's gonna be as a fly without school pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like a chairman, built and bomb without enough number of trained soldiers who could finish the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the word in Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morals, not prepared, and it will not be able to compare the possible enemies."
"There's going to see the aggression."
In the Annex added with the letter of McCain and Graham Panetta, the reduction of "expressive operation risks: low reactions on crisis, conflicts and catastrophes; explicit limits of the possibilities of results and setting throughout the world; predicted unrecommended risks in future war operations."
Panetta also added that some of the largest protected projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, and those who are first in rare planning fases.
For example, the F35 aircraft planned by a new bombarder, the ballistic potters of new generation, the new ships of married battle, and the new earthquake vehicle who wanted to replace the army and the sea rate.
By stoping the further development and testing of the F35 airport, 80 billion USD would be explored during the next ten years, but his resident states that there is another step in the improvement of the army that is required to arise the country with potential graves from China and other rivals.
How to recognize lie
The late view of recent news titles refers to the serious and increasing lying and crying in every day.
The Republican President's candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work with accusation that he had sexually troubled a few women - both sides say that the second lies.
Officers on the University of Penn State were accused of a crown witness when they were trying to hide records about that the pensioned photoball trainer had sexually hit a boy.
The last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was approved as the executed microphone says to the President Barck Obam that the Israeli President of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu is lying.
The lie could destroy the whole carrier and include the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that were immediately produced by unexpectable evidence.
The president candidate John Edwards was accused that he broke funds from his campaign to try to escape his unmanished position.
And nobody will forget the medical circus that shot around Bill Clinton when he lied in the second time in his sexy income with Monico Lewins.
It's just the story of training in school and university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers only to look well in their positions.
The mentors who have to teach the challenge are sending a message that the lie and the lead is acceptable.
How many we'll meet?
The studies show that you're in the only day between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's imagine that many of them are favorable lie.
Another study showed that strangers in the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life were threatened.
The definition of lies, or "life recognition" is necessary to develop each one, for personal or work reasons.
However, it's no social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharad, when a man cries, "I have you." The recognition of the claim is a series of sciences that work with scientist data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed projects, especially in the area of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the investigation is that most of the old lying lies have been issued.
The lie look at you quietly in your eyes.
It's not the way they're kidding, cocktail, red, or smoking.
Nevertheless, don't be exceeding that it's hard to observe and decline.
The school identificator of lying can be able to decline the truth from a large state, detailed expressions in the face, the form of creating questions and their time.
I have tried a few years in the collection of scientists from the developing development of the lie recognition and is clear that the department of the claim is a modern understanding that can easily teach and in today's compatible world can help you - especially if between your work obligations belongs to the minimum, the order of contracts, the education or the guidance of people.
The good liars can read well and in others, let them be watched, direct their emotions and intuitively understand how the second side accepts them.
From research we know that extruding lying often than introver that men's lying more "mixed" men, while women say more lying "from others" - most of them to protect some feelings - women lying less of their partners than free people (including the lying that says, most of them are "false".
We also know that if you are sinners, others feel less offense when they lie to you.
How do you know someone lying?
First, watch the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "Initial observation".
Thanks to him, you'll have a later discovery with what to compare.
Take care of the body of the subject, his smiling, work with vote.
You should know if somebody usually throws up the feet, so that you don't wrongly accused him from the lie just because he's starting to smoke his feet through the meeting.
Then try to determine a false and neutral behavior.
However, make it just as an exciting signal, not as a evidence of lies.
People who lead lying can stop move the top half body when they are trying to remember their ideal story, they can turn to the door, move up to the east, explicitly change the threat of the body, or give the point of the "level after the end of the conversation" - transmitted unexpected delay and change the position when it is difficult to answer them.
People who exercise conversations often give false signal that it's an interview at the end to see how it's going to appear after his end.
Take also the language of the subject.
The famous is a story about how Scott Peterson had ever spoken and used the past time when he stated that his murdered woman was alive, which was divorced after her body.
"I have no sexual relationship with this lady... Mrs. Lewins" or the difficult question repairs.
The most common verb signs are very invisible.
Somebody can use a lot of "mixing language" when he answers a difficult question, "Well... to say the truth... of what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such responses, we don't know too much of the facts, and often is another warning signal.
There is no cocktail that can be disappointed by each lie, but it is possible to develop the ability that will be lying.
The help of these powers will have a man a greater opportunity to find no liar and leader in his personal and work.
Contracting plan for the establishment of a road consumption will be transformed after the decrease of the approval of the United States Government
A few days after the Government of Oboma had rejected the approval of the planned road disorders from Canada to Mexico - which has been sent to himself a department, but the environmentalists - the company who had a stage of disasters announced that it was able to change the project so that it would be done again in movement.
The TransCanada Community announced that the movement of the planned transport was destroyed from the ecological civil area of Sandhills in Nebraice, and it is convinced that the project would also be approved.
The Community announced the print conference in the Nebraic Government.
The Stups of TransCanada Alex Nurbax says that the company is convinced that the construction will finally be approved, although it will bring another transport.
This announcement came after the last week, the Ministry of the frontier stated that it describes a decision on the federal approval of the project since it does not carry out the potential replacement studies, with which it could not be able to enter into the area of Sandhills in Nebrasce and to the Water Board of Overall.
"This is really going before," said the Republican Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological judgment of the Ministry of the Constitution would likely have been decided to 2013, thus a year after elections in the next year, the authorities reject that the decision would play a political role in the decision.
Both in the written statement of the past week, the decision described as a request of the Ministry's border and declared to him its support.
1 700 miles of long consumption will be connected to Canada and Mexico.
From the Province of Albert to the Rafiner in Texas on the day Protector of 700 000 eggs.
This way will be to protect six states.
This project really hate environmentality, but loves the workshops that deny that in the work of consumption will appear 20,000 new workplaces.
However, the legislators in Nebraska were set against this plan and considered the implementation of laws that would use the company to not enter into the region of Sand Hills and to the water level of Ogallal, the main source of water water and enhancement.
The continuing study on the environmental impact that the Ministry of the frontier was achieved, found that the project would have only a detailed negative impact, but the source of energy industry said that the general inspector of the Ministry had published a new review of the whole original study process, and was mainly subject to two questions.
One time it was whether the lobbyist of TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was in 2008 by the Council of Hillary Clinton, had not been proposed in the conflict of interests.
Next, whether the company that was achieved to the original study was not chosen inadequately because she had the provisions for the TransCanada company.
Patti LaBelle is accused of that the bathlee has turned to fear.
The New York Family says that Patti LaBelle's song was awkwardly entered into their manhattan house and throwed their daughter so that she turned back from that fear.
"Lady Marmalade" exited the 18th months of Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "the changes of personality, I'll lose sleep" and "hearted fear of strangers," she describes her family in the prison to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
On November 10 of the lonely year, the technology Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a teacher in school, and Genevieve was able to get a family exit.
When Kevin Monk came to the car, Roseanna Monk was gathered down to their house in Riverside Boulevard and sent with him and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a minute, and the kid was loosed at the moment.
"Anybody appeared after me and said, "You know what your daughter does?" I said "no" and I went to take her.
LaBelle's wedding woman was punished.
"The aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter to the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She cried out and started talking hardly -- she cried out the most simple expressions...
She had a smoke with water and started getting water after me.
He says Genevieve got hissterical story.
"I said that woman, "See what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle seemed to her mother - she still had Genevieve - and had to stop her until she's driving, which finally left her to the waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl called so much when she returned, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle asked forgiveness, but there were no answers to them.
The employer and speaker LaBelle don't respond to our phones to tell them all of them.
The labour requires nearly unconsciously, but a family law manager, Sam Davis, said that the case was worthless and that the family plans all the judicial money to take charity organisations with a child with a child.
"The purpose is to use Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her starting," said Davis.
"Those behavior is exactly inacceptable, especially if it is attached to teacher from schools in the 19th-year-year-old child."
Economic disappearance of climate
During the first year, the Government of Mary Lopez Valdez has grown in Sinaloa's unemployment and incompatibility, including foreign investments and with them and economics
In 2011, it is written in the economic history of Sinaloa. One year of the Government Mary Lópeze Valdez, who is named the Government’s change. This Government has brought a great expectation in the case of economic progress, although the unrecommended climate conditions at the beginning of the year have not been indicated any growth and has even arrived to the main economy development indicators.
The lower fever temperatures have caused millions of losses in agricultural areas, restricted the possibilities of growth of State economy, with awareness of reducing the economic activity of 3.6% in the first semester of this year, and in the area of agriculture, the history of 31,16%, which was dismissed by dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the reports of the caused failure that the Mexican Council for maintaining external development were notified at 582 835 hectares undertaken, 78.03% was completely destroyed and on the remaining 21.07% were found part of the failure.
In addition to the economic activity until November, there was a constant growth of unemployment in the State. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography of Peace of Insurance in the State, the independence in the first three fourth years was recorded. Since January to March was unemployed 55 053 citizens of Sinaloa, which represents the independence of the independence in over 4,53% of the Economic Population. In the second quarter-term session, the independence of 5,28% and between the quarter and the total degree was not achieved, and 6,19% of the non-existence of the 1869-year persons.
Less liquidity
For unemployment during the year in the Sinaloa State, more factors can be made. According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantese, Director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Faculty is possible to explain insufficiently, based on steps that have been carried out at public policy level.
"We are witnesses of insufficiency, which relates to various factors, and among them is other loss of liquidity on the market because of the restrictions of resources in the consequences of the legislation that he approved the Congress in conformity with the fight against the monetary money, and for people who are illegally strengthening the dollars, it is not easy to make it investment or to use it."
migration stops
López Cervantes showed that the democratic factor is also involved in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who go for work to the frontier, in the United States, was reduced, but because of the reasons of unnecessary income and then, as even when these people are in the border, it is hard for them to get their jobs, and people remain and require work from our State, and thus the unemployment grows."
Incompatible
The analysis of the work market in Sinaloa is also reduced by the cause of increased incomprehensibility that is raised in the area of work conditions. For the National Statistics and Democracy, 60,38% of the employed citizens in the State are working, and they would not delay the doses in the process of social security.
To the unemployment and incompatibility, there are additional employment market marks as lower payments. In this administrative area, the lower payments of the whole country are referred to in the records of the Mexican Social Security and the Secretariat of Working and Social Planning.
The average month of workers in the Sinaloa State was in September 5 352 pest, deeply under the national average, which moves in part 7 375 peset.
Reduction of direct border investments
In 2011, the increase of economic activities and the growth of unemployment was also recorded the highest investment of direct frontier investments for the past 10 years. According to the Ministry's Financial Affairs in June to June, the direct range investment of 630 697 dollars, which represents 87,74 per cent of $5,143 312 for the same period in the past year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the State will carry investment in 17,280 million pest per year, and these investments, especially to the services businesses.
Draw
In accordance with the Economic Population scenario of the Government of this State, the State Congregation requested to approve a piece of up to 3 billion peso. This would be determined for investment to infrastructure projects in 18 cities in order to rescue the economy. The local congress approved the board in over 2 600 million peso.
Reaction
According to the officers of the business sector, the first year of the Government Mary Lópeze Valdencia has shown the loss of the government's capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Transformation Industries, declared that in 2011 the devotion of individual sectors, including the same government.
"The economy in Sinaloa was really invisible in this year, and we have to work intensely to get back the south we lost in the air year. In 2012, we have to double the efforts, the harmonization of all of us, especially the right and synchronized functioning of this new government, hope that the next year will be much better."
Economic polarity
Loredo López stated that the events as a smoker at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The failure economic move was made a series of events, except for other shoes, and one of the main results was the reduction of the economy that had not remembered sufficiently quickly to reach dynamicity, which would allow to achieve the acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services, and thus we felt deeply under expected prognoses in the end of the year."
Refunction definition
According to Teodora Salazara Uriarte, President of the employment Confederation of the Mexico Republic in Sinaloa, it is necessary to contribute to the dynamic productive activities.
"We are noticed that it works, and we believe that it is necessary to prepare a long plan where the objectives and economic direction of the State should be redefined, because it is important to promote all the potential of material and human resources that are with Sinaloa."
The work that is before us
The President Coparmex showed the importance of establishing future views that would be better guided by government efforts.
"I would certainly say that the Government was trying to get good results in various areas, in the area of economic development has come to some progress, but it is important to create a long plan."
He showed that the current administrative has shown progress on the guideline of the public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to say that the government is trying to be proud, and I can say it is to see the work done here and I believe that the government knows that there is also a lot of work before us."
8 kg marihuana
The resident of Navolato was judged for five years of prison and for 100 days of trial for cutting eight miles of marihuana.
The General Procurement of the Republic informed that the dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuel Sandoval. It was sentenced for a criminal crime of health, particularly for the arrest of marihuana for trade purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was held by the mexican army composed on 7 June 2010 when he was in the street of Cipriano Valdez, in contrast of the station 80 in the quarter of El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer went in the other type of pick up the white colors. In the car in the car, he had a black tattoo and on the room of a small bathroom. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marihuana.
For these reasons, a certain man remains available to the Court of the Second Section and the management remains internal within the Centre for the implementation of legal impacts of criminal acts.
The project articles are required
Social projects such as Habitat, Safety of Public places and 3x1 for migrants are dangerous that they will not be attached to the end or that they will have a great supply for the cause of losing economic resources, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Officer of the City Social Development pointed out that if the structural employment has still gone before, it is now threatened that the Government of the State will not be able to ensure the competent additions required by means above 11 million peso on three programmes.
He showed that the total investment in these three programmes is at least 50 million peso. The state is 25%. At this time, the funds for work have added only the Federation and the city, so it is possible that the projects will be successful.
"They have to assure about about 12 millions and even though the year has already come to the end, we didn't get anything, but we have already had to get part in July," he said, "Surely, we have not lost time, we have started projects and continued very carefully, but we're missing money."
He showed that in the long-term year for the management of Jesuse Aguilara Padilla, he did not complete the appropriate additives, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to request a piece to offer more than 7 million that had not given them the State administration.
"The matter has already happened in the past sixty-times, because the State had no economic capacity to participate and programmes continued, and we had to get to the missed programmes, we had to get the means that would pay the things that did not have been done."
Although there is a vote from the State representatives on the transfer of these resources, he pointed out that the request was sent to Armandu Villarreal, the secretary of administration and finance, to ensure that the management and the corresponding proceedings were first reached.
"We have to give us 12 million and even if the year is close to the end, we haven't yet got no peso."
The Court approves "End of analogy sentence" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogical signals of digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has lost in the last years.
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) refused the essential claim of the Senate and the Possional Secretary-General against the Presidency Decree, which wanted to be fulfilled by the "Analogic Signal" in 2015 instead of 2021. He concluded that there was no needed eight voices that would pay it.
Many of the four Ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that the President Felipe Calderon did not proceed his authority when he gave a decision in which individual steps are presented to transite to the earth's digital TV.
With this result, the request was rejected by the Senate, and because the most qualified of the eight voices had not been achieved to express the court to the establishment or the injustice of the restricted decision that remains valid.
The proposal of the Court of the Ministry of Olgo Sánchez Cordero provides the possibility to declare a decree for unexpectable, since the regulation of all questions on radio and television is the matter which is under the law of the Federal Commission for Telecommunication (Cofetel). It is so to ensure the principles of hierarch subordination and the exclusion of the law.
For the project only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the same Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, as the Senat, the Spanish dream supported essential sports in trying to fight the decree. The Ministry of Sanchez Cordero accepted the requirements and stopped applying the decree and all actions described in it, leading to transmission to digitalization.
The meeting of the Ministers also decided to reject the request given by the Mission, without entering into the debate on the proposal, which is also concerned with the Minister of Sanchez Cordero.
In its explanation, the President of the Ministry declared that it was not compared to the proposal arguments in the meaning that the federal execution could not be structured through the general rule of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it would do it, it would be covered by the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and mentioned that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunication sector is an appropriate federal exemption that has a fundamental mandate to determine the Directive of the State.
Analogical signals of digital signals are one of the biggest changes that have used the world for the last years. It relates to the best use of radio-electric spektrum, better quality of signals and more channels.
It is considered that the change would be a department of the use of digitalization that requires decisions in the public interest. The digitalization is not only technical, but "the issues of economic, social, political and national security issues."
As indicated, these questions "require the operations of the whole rural system, in accordance with the principle of the Economic Control of the State, and includes the whole series of competences which the Agreement carried into the government's hand."
He recalled that the whole number of countries throughout the world has already rejected the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, although they had been available to high-specialised technical authorities.
He said that it was not possible to the Government by providing an incompatible decree which includes in certain measures in the field of the Conference of Legislation, to carry into the administrative area of the laws prepared for legal power.
In Michoacan analyses the possibility of calculating "A voice per voice"
According to the data published by the PREP differences between the first and the second place in the Government options are not amounted to 27 per cent. The voice 879 of 6074 of the choices were not yet counted.
The possibility of calculating the "good by vote" was found in aeroplane options in Michoacan, where, in accordance with the data published by the Programme of the previous election results (PREP), the differences between the first and the second place in the non-all gubernament options of 27 per cent, and it was not yet calculated by 879 of the total 6074 choice courses.
In this agreement, the President of the General Council of the Election Institute in Michoacán (IEM), Mary de Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, remarked that in a few days ago, 9 November, the election authorities adopted a whole number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal election reform.
As it is still recognised, Michoacán did not officially confirm his political institution or his State choice code or the Law on election justice. The State Congress approved reforms soon before they had to apply the legal period for their entry into force yet in this election period and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel forgot their publication in the state of law of the Official State Office with that we had to reach against him.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) has resolved the essential sports initiated local legislation and published the head of the State in the cases of "injust and illegal" because it does not have the right to apply or not.
At the question of the "vood by vote" Maria de Los Angeles Llanderal replied that by approval of the relevant measures by the General Council, it would be possible to make party and total calculation of the local choice authority.
This means of partial calculation of votes, one or more election packages, shall be carried out for the following conditions: the choice results are not matched; there is no record of the calculation of votes and calculation in the corresponding field or there is no president given available; or if the bugs and the clear outputs of the optional results are not available.
Furthermore, the total recommendation of votes in all elections will be performed if there is an indice that the differences between the potential winning of the choice and the candidate in the other place are less or round of one percentage point; always when at the beginning of the meeting the explicit request of the leader of the parties and/or coalyce that proposed the candidate on the second place.
The entire review of the voice will also be able to implement when after a series of numbers, the differences between the probable wind and the candidate in the other place are low or less than one percentage point, and also when there is an explicit request of political parties, which the candidate has finished in the second place. In such cases, the choice packages will be issued by part of the numbering.
It must be considered that in this situation there are choices in Morelia, where the PREP is the difference between the first and the second place of 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 choice courses were not yet numbered.

The new Italian government will be called in the center.
The named President of the Government of Mario Monti will come tomorrow with the Italian President to present him a new government, which will fulfil the crisis that keeps this country on the property of economic catastrophes.
The President of the Government of Mario Monti, named tomorrow, will come to the Italian President to present him a new government, which will be fulfilled by the crisis that is maintained by this country on the property of economic catastrophes and which has been carried out into the danger of the whole eurozone.
The Chairman of the Chairman gave a report in which he announced that Monti, named in the week, is in the middle of the President Giorgi Napolitan, to confirm him that he could create a government.
It is expected that the Government represents the majority of the technologies, although it is not yet clear when the new government is able to take power.
Monti announced that the President presents the results of his discussions that he led to political parties in order to create government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to convince this difficult phase," said the ex-European newspaper.
Monti did not explicitly say that it would be able to create government, but the ton of his comments stated that the overseers were convinced.
"The frame is now well designed," added.
Monti has completed the process of creation of governments for less than three days, so in a shorter time than it is normal, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, because of the highest depth of the unmantainable level.
The new administrative led to the ancient European Commissioner Monti must apply a sustainable package of effort measures required by European leaders, and it will only be possible to renew the renewed trust in Italy.
In Montigo, there is a great pressure to write. Instabilly, the markets have passed the measures from the Italian delegates BTP with a ten-year-year-old rate of 7 per cent border, at the level when Greece and Ireland had to request saving.
Emma Marcegagli, the President of the Italian Officers of Confindustria, said to the newspapers after meeting with Montim, "We said we are very supporting this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity to get Italian from this packaging situation.
Monti's hope for success has been explicitly raised thanks to support from the PDL Silvia Berluscoi, which the crisis has made on the Sabbath to replace.
"We think that the efforts of Professor Monti are predicted to good results," said the newspapers Angelina Alfano, the secrets of the Mediterranean Series.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian parties, is significant because until this time, all of its members have been established against the Government of the most technology established by Monti.
Aid to Parliament
The new Monti Government must have a strong support to the Parliament to promote non-popular reforms.
Any transmission or reaching in the given effort could be chosen by new and disagreements on financial markets.
The Italian Association of the Foreign Banks has been added to the claim and warned that Monti could mean a catastrophe.
Monti started in the morning with political parties, departments and business groups, young organizations and women.
On the day of operation, it's gonna end in the worst night.
Monti was named President Napolitan on week, which allowed a very quick progress in the crisis.
After a short degree of the last week, when Berlusconi had already been clear that the democracy was given, Italian delegations returned to critical border and reacted to the immorality if the new President of the Government has succeeded.
Save Italy, which a public debt is moved up to 1,8 billion euros, would be above the possibilities of current euro zone financing reserves.
Monti announced that his Government should be held in force until the next elections planned for 2013, and that is, in particular, general prognoses, which says that the policies give him time to implement reforms and then proclaim forward options.
Monti said that he would like to fulfil the policy in his cabinet, but the greatest parties remain that this government should be established only from the experts to bring Italy out of the hate where the country has gone from the cause of financial pressure.
Political resources have stated that the incredible unbelieving and non-compliance between the parties is complicated to try to attach to government and political personality.
Spanish participating international stages often than the Costarians
From 22 Spanish footballists, ten cross border of 50 international passengers.
On the side of Costaky, only one of the 22 allowed players has grown up to the number of 50 boards.
Great contrast on the side of Costakya, if we compare 22 players of both countries who have come to friendly excuses today at 15:05 at the National Station in San José.
While the officers of the world and Europe, the number of one month of the FIFA rating, they have a wide scale of interim exploitation class A, Costarica only has the conversion of Michaela Umana, who is the only one of the international challenges.
This number has received the last fifth at the breakfast against Panama (0-2) at the station of Romel Fernández.
Spanish footballists who play in the explosion of the stars and in powerful English first ligue clubs hold the intensive activity on lens shampionates and households and outsets at high levels in the framework of European pools like Champions League.
We also need to add experiences from the national Spanish team in compliance with Europe and the world championates.
Costarian players have a very limited possibilities of front-term pads in the area. For example, there is Concaf, which is considered as the least level in the FIFA frame.
We see that the largest number of foreign excuses from the Spanish representation has on his account of Iker Casillas, who came to the last Sunday before England (progress 0-1 in London) to the former branch Andoni Zubizaret with 126 international excuses.
Casillas will also go to Costarica today and gets a new record for Spain - 127 international excuses.
Xavi Hernández, a key player of Barcelona, has 106 passengers on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially published by the EUFA with other Spanish players who have been on their end of the centuries, which have already reduced Zubizarret to 126 and the Middle Affairs Schalke, Raul González, 102.
The hundreds closed Carles Puyol with 97 shoes.
Following Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres from 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costaky and near Michaela Umana moves the left steel Junior Dyaz with 48 shops and Bryan Ruiz branch 45.
Next only 5 overscreen the border 30 passengers: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The minimum number of ships.
With less than 30 passengers in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 boards of Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myria with 23.
The rest doesn't have 20 years old.
While Nano Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costarice Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are waiting for their first storm.
The best shooter of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and follows him Fernando Torres with 27.
On the costanic side, there's the best achievements of Bryan Ruiz, nine, about two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifty-five-year-year-old land in her turn at the opportunity of celebrating twenty years existence
"The path to Kostaric is a dream that's reality."
In the exclusive conversation for Viva, Jeff Ament base from Pearl Jam said that the group is prepared for the next week to offer one of the best concerts at the National Station.
We were waiting for more than 20 years, but the same group ensures that the possibility of playing in Costarica represents a full dream.
This was the basis and a member of Jeff Ament who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the south-American continent in the framework of tours in the opportunity to celebrate twenty years of existence and on week 20 will be on a single residence in Central America.
This day will go up from 19:30 to the National Station together with the The X and national musicians from Las Roberts.
This is an expression of the conversation that you will find the whole replacement on the La Nation on the Internet pages.
Perl Jam will play in Costarica. Do you know what your fans are doing?
The way to Kostaric is our dream that actually happens.
In South and Central America, we were a second and a great experience.
I've been on Costa Rica once once, once once, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we're gonna be here for a few days.
So we have a great joy that we can bring you our music.
I'm asking, because there's a group of adults, the fanoises are very intensively prepared for these days.
What do you say to your most beautiful friends?
Thanks for you staying with us so long for years.
We were almost 21 years before we arrived in Kostaric, thanks for waiting for so long, and we're sorry that it was so long for us.
Some people are talking about the concert as the greatest show of the year.
Did it call you a bigger pressure?
Some of the largest shows we've led for the past 21 years have come in the horizon a few weeks.
We've brought some great shows in Sao Paul, and we hope that we've got in the form of concert in Costa Rica.
We're really happy for this concert.
We love this land, we love serphy, we like jeungle, and for both activities, Costarica is the best country in the world.
How did you recognize Kostaric and her hair to surface?
We have a lot of surface friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarando.
My friends are going to surf in Costa Rica or Nikaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best places of surfation, so we learned about Costarica through people who love surfation.
If we look at your tours, you've prepared a great show with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costarica?
Because we never played here, we don't have any limits that we couldn't do.
We're trying to imagine what's best show with different songs. We're trying to play a couple of songs from each album and imagine our fanois good and different repertories.
You're never packing a repertorie.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine alb and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we'll play every night.
When we have two three songs we haven't played long, we're focusing on them and we're surprised, because we remember why we liked us so much and that we've already forgotten it.
So it's more interesting for us, and I think it's more interesting for people.
This turn will celebrate 20 years of dreams.
When you look back, is it hard to believe all you did?
Yeah, it's sure.
First, I think no one of us could imagine that we're in one big rock group and that we're staying in it over 20 years, it seems like a dream.
We know how power we have given us and find us that we can still play together.
We're happy and loved to create music.
We're happy that we can look at the places we've always used.
We couldn't get better.
What did you mean that you were a significant part of the relationship of the branch?
It was always honorable for us that we could be part of this group in which the majority are involved.
People of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprised when the sounds come from the group of friends, it's not very often happening.
From time, the group will come to a group, but it is much less common to take up five to ten groups from one city.
We're hungry, and we're feeling that we can be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're playing some more.
Last year, we were on the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw Soundgarden on the road, and we have happy that they are all our friends, and we are honored that we could be part of this depression that occurred in Seattl.
It is also very common to maintain a group like your field and also have the same members after these years.
Yes, we're four together 21 years ago and Matt (Cameron) have been connected to us 13 years ago, and the same time is much longer than the normal duration of the group.
I think we're all happy first that we're still in this world and the second of our role plays real that we're still interesting each other.
We are all neighbor friends and thanks to this, we have been able to open musical paths that allow each suffering freedom to own experience.
We believe one another, we care for music and I think it could not be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but you can do what you like.
How are you looking for equality?
As we grow, it was going to be more easier to find the equation.
We're trying to go not too much on the tour because it's very easy to fall into this path of dawns and people who love our music.
When you know that people came because of music, you remember that you need music and what you gave it, respect, and you don't have to leave to unless you are celebrated, rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and at the beginning it was something big.
As a capel, we had three years, and we never had any album until Andy died (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it was so long. The most important is that we are also friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the chapel with us. When I hear a song or look at photographs, I remember Andy how incredible I was with him. It was always a joy to work with him, to talk about music or football and many others.
It was an incredible person, and it misses us.
The National Captain of Las Robertas will be confirmed to start show in Costarica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as a prejudice?
Yes, the production sent a video to us with a few proposals, and this group loved us most, so we know what Las Robertas offers to live and must be very funny.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's words alive?
It's a question of Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's singing her, and I think he's gonna add the first thing he's going to do.
Who affects you as a base?
Many people.
As the first, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much that I could talk about the basic teams I like.
How did Pearl Jam get to maintain the grunge, even if he's not in the way?
I think we're always feeling easy to separate from the word.
When it says grunge, I'll imagine the groups of which I have changed like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvan and all the others that have occurred in the same time. And if this music is valid today, it's something great, because it's a music that's going to listen for it and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At the beginning, your music had a easy smoking character, and now it's more positive.
What's going on for this change?
It's interesting, because I feel that in the new albums there are some tracks that are easier, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breath, which are considered to be very humble, but they can be considered positive.
On both of them, when Ed played them, I wept, and they're singing deep darkness.
I think when you grow and have some trauma in life, you lose someone of your family or your friend, these things will begin to influence your mind and music and these two letters for me.
I also think you can be a happy man and even do a bunch of music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical tests
The president Alberto Fujimori was in an accidental hospitalised in public hospital, where they will test him for the reason of the favour losses that he suffered in the field of the field of the grounds, he informed his observant doctor.
72 years of Fujimori, who rejects 25 years, will take freedom for the elimination of human rights under his government (1990 - 2000), suffers several diseases, including linguisms, because it was four times operated and the doctors are currently under control.
The apostle Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said the television station Canal N, that Fujimori will take tests in the National Institution of Nation of Opacity, where they should find why he hurts and why loss powers in the bottom.
Aguinaga said that, according to his opinion, Fujimori could get mercy from humanitarian reasons, however, the old president himself does not get mercy because he feels innocent.
Four times had been operated because of the linguish, he fulfilled 18 kilograms and added further diseases as a difficult erosion gastritide, cysta on the slides, ledwin stones, high pressure and both problems in the feet, called the doctor.
Fujimori rejects the penalty from September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Political Operations.
In April 2009, 25 years of prison was condemned by 25 people who murdered the armies of the military soldier in the first year of his government.
Musical to visit Mexico to send political designs
The official delegation that leads the President of Uruguay, Joseph Mujica, introduced several ministry and businesses, starts in an outcome of Mexico. It is the purpose of achievement of the expansion of trade between both nations and to touch the political subjects of the region given.
The music is in the middle of his Mexican Province, Felipe Calderon. One of the most important meetings of visits is the full meeting with the representatives of the policy, trade and advisor of uruguay community in Mexico. The programme was published by the U.S. president office.
The meeting of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between both countries," published the Uuguay President Office on their websites.
According to the local communicators with the Musica will try to take Calderon to support Uruguay in Sport with France, where the French President Nicolas Sarkoza has established South America's country on the list of money gardens for G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his statement, Sarkoza rejected that the countries who will continue to achieve the position of paying gardens will be issued from the international community, and this announcement has been called the rejected statement from Uruguaye and consultation with the majority in this European country.
Mexican President G20 from November. G20 is a group created by the most powerful developing countries and developing countries. The Latin America countries have been concluded since January this year, the Agreement on the exchange of information to refuse the two views.
The Uruguay Government in recent years encourages the agreement on fishing exchange with the purpose of obtaining from the " Black Lists" Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in which countries have not adopted all required international cooperation standards in the data area.
From the Mexican and Uruguay trade view, the Agreement on Free Trade (FTA) has been concluded since 2004, taking into account the contribution of goods between both countries.
Your installer runs in 3D thanks "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fights more than 25 years recently to save the Princess Peach from Bowsera's faults, however, he never found in 3D: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of girls with the stereoscope technology.
The title that comes in this month to all trades throughout the world was already created from the beginning to use all characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS transmitted console that allows to play 3Ds games, and you should not use brain.
"Mario is a position that must say how to work a stereoscope without breeding," introduced a specialised printer in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Allvarez, during the presentation of video games in Madrid.
Alvarez showed that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo created specially for this room", because until this time successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Gelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo speaker said that except that the dream is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows us to use a fast and full party.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "unanimous", which is the task to join less exploited users.
As you realize this level, you can leave in "the second round" on the level games that are this time more popular.
Furthermore, users can choose a real time between "agressive D" or a person who affects only the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play 3D to be able to perform the most different calls and "not belong to optical climates."
This new procedure of Super Maria in 3D also provides the return to the transfer console, which has not been achieved since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays the notes of those who monitor and repeat the successful forms of the previous parts. He hopes that a vital man's installer will have to travel dangerous platforms to free the princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in moves, around, overseas and among the enemies, it also appears to be "gave" Luigi.
Colom approved the delivery of Portilla to the United States
President Alvaro Colom in the outerland announced that he put steps in the question of the ex-President Alfonse Portilla, which is responsible for the payment of $70 million in the United States.
This ends the process that it was to respond to the request of the north country that requires Portilla to judge him.
On the Press Conference of Colom confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he had remembered that the Court of Criminal has already established a statement.
He ensure that during his mandate, he was "not safe" in court decisions and allowed all the issues that he got on his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be delivered to murder and sergio Marroquin for a serious crime for health and Edgar Strata Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trade.
Colomn's step means the execution step after all courts and essential instances were exhausted to lead a process against the ex-President governing in 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Court and the Court of Justice (CC), Portillo will be delivered after its legal situation was resolved in Guatemala and will be committed to maintaining human rights.
Portillo was considered innocent in the absence of 120 million in the Ministry of Protection during its presidency, but the public Ministry was called and returned to the game.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people in the state of migration
The Organisation has taken place to help children without education that they should not face the front of the society.
The billion of the first 25 years of existence of the social support of Trinijove is very important: 6000 young people who have painted social exemption have been helped. The organization will help them to realize difficult situations.
It is necessary to read a lot of hundred workplaces that were received for this society group.
The last year, the balance was also served in the framework of the festival act that was reached in the former product areas of Fafa and Coats and participated in more than 300 persons.
The Trinijove Organization took place in the fourth Trinidad Vella in 1986 with the purpose of helping young people with lower education, without work relating to drugs or situations when they could fall into social exemption.
The last meeting in Sant Andrea participated in the large number of organizations and institutions cooperated with partnerships in over 25 years.
A variety of political representation, in the time of choice, showed a single character of the work that trinijove realizes.
Along with the President of Generality, Artur Masem, and his president Jordi Pujol, participated with the old socialist advice for education, Ernest Maragall, and an older objective of old and modern ecological socialist Ricard Goma.
In the large room of Fa Fabra and Coats, the current advice for Social Behaviour and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the General Director of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove had taken up in a very difficult time and that today's entire number of transmissions, but he added that the work that the association has brought to today is a good basis.
The President introduced Trinijove as an example of how to fight indigenous circumstances and how to add respect to people in difficult situations.
"The Crisis is not for this organization and for the work that he does, I do nothing new," he said.
It came to get up the house in which gigantic birds were organized
The shooters had 11 of 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 Ocpants left the house yesterday in the midnight, and they don't put the opposite
Everything proves that the night's shadows of the 51 neighborhood in the Balmes street are finally at the end.
Twelve people have left the building that they lived unlegally and where they organized gigantic birds that built neighborhoods, and they have left the Court Regulation and have no need to contain the police.
After the end of the operation, the lock was turned to the door to refuse the recurrence of the situation.
"On this moment the entrance will be watched," said the manager.
Opupants who took 11 of 13 bytes in the construction data - residents are residents - they took all electronic and partly and water equipment, except the walls, and left all kinds after alcohol drinks.
In the first three bytes, there were channels of large birds that remained for two days, and the other weapons were built.
Under the building, Balmes 51, which was also crazy.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press, that after the time of the building was built, the markets were rent 80%.
The driver shows that the builders of the buildings have done her unexpected competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros where the discotch is 10.
Furthermore, the officer of the employment had to respond to the accommodation of the seats because of the depth, but only the problems of visitors, but the citizens of the house, and especially those who participated in the party of the party of the party, which frequency and intensity in the past weeks, increased by various citizens.
The director explained that the problems were so big that even agreed with the officer of the building, and for nine months he would forgive her.
The city police also confirmed that in the past weeks, she received more courageousness from the seats at the situation.
The President of the City Group of the PP Party on the Council, Alberto Fernández Dyaz, requested the last week to "the building was immediately exhausted and so confronted with the problems of the citizen usage that are in the neighborhood, and with the destruction of the areas."
The President of the people explained that there was only one sentence before the year, but in the last months, the officers had received all the building fathers and at least all the lives, and in one of them even got a ransom.
In this Directive he added: "It must be concluded with unrespectiveness and to be successful if it acts against civil responsibility to which the building has come."
Yesterday, the city police also shut up the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes the police arrived in the building 35 on the Mont-al street after they called her neighbors who saw entering the building four people.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects have met in the opportunity to ensure the management that is more than the field of respect to the honourers
The 16 ports of the city selection manager will again open the debate on the role of the Park Collserola in Barcelona.
In half of 80 years, during the largest light of the metropolitan de Barcelona Corporation, this samoshistry printed several packlets on the Collserola park support.
The aircraft defined the mountain as a large metropolitic park of Barcelona.
Moreover, he was fulfilled with a number comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB in 1987, the park returned to the thoughts of many as the top border of Barcelona. Catalan metropole is even one of the small ones that are not orientated north-south, but the top (hour) - Down ( sea).
The quality of Collseroly as a natural park is in this direction.
Reference wasn't already Central Park, but Yellowstone with divorce in place of Yogi.
That was the position until September, when the rabbit announced my council of 16 conquests on the same number of incoming gates in Collseroly.
Of course, the gate's loads a lot of the thinking of the park.
Be this, or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or hour?
In the context of the pure organization, as based on the reflection of the city, this question becomes the middle subject of all barcelon architectures.
It is already the same threat, as if two members of these old boxes have been chosen at the meeting in the board, they give their hands.
And just this cause has chosen one of the serious agreements between the three Barcellon Architects and the Universal Professors.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Model and Marta Bayon: the election management has its remission.
According to Roldana after the question of the side of the smoke, "It's necessary" to discuss and about the "Hore side", so Ildefonse Cerda on the green jabls was not attached to the end.
"We have to go out of the principle that the greatest barcelon park is a plane.
Except others of your great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," reported an architect for the name of "Birds to Collserola" in himself "lexicological past": we can't imagine them "come income to the park, but even as the extent of the area where it is possible."
Model, like Roldan and Bayon, with experiences of urbanism world, qualifys the proposal as a "intelectual explanation" " some dangers".
The dangers of the "existence that presents today a project of public location" after the experience of 80 years, which had been in the Forum's "the labour's song".
The first fear is the only limit of the border where it should be established.
"It means to make another step," it is basically to move on the step.
"The new urbanistic and planning tools must be reached, because they are current (with the universe metropolitic plan (PGM) can make real assembly."
If we are focused on more details on the question, Model thinks that the powerful Sweet Collserola can "reason for the park," but the barcelone part of nowhere, and that's because of the right topographic reasons.
Motel also reminded that there is already a work that has done the Patronat de Collserola, which "not have to finish on smetish", even when he welcomes the reality that the rabbits offer his gramousness, that he's going to go to the project from "the first moment".
It also understands that the nearest of the mountains and the cities are like a propulsion that allows architectures to enter into the debate, but "that's supposed," that it should be just this technical profile that leads multidisciplinary teams (it's all the ability), which should be created: "Architektes should be only tools."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is composed, because in the bases for the choice management, the global view of Collserola has not been able to have 16 election managements that are concerned with all the mountains - sea, but there is no appropriate study that is looking at the area and getting it as a whole.
This makes it, at least, he was invited to all 16 election managements.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can lead to the concept and definition of the architecture of the neighbourhood.
According to his opinion, the Council should agree that the space that is directly on Ronda de Dalt should ensure all the length of the exploitation area that would ensure the plot transition between the city and the defence.
Casino promised Jonas Larazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of prison, the lawful forcer Cadino Red made mercy to the brother's elders of Monterrey in the process where he was struck for a detailed investigation.
Manuel Jonas Larazabal tried in prison 72 days, and now it will be released after his lawful power Casino Red made mercy before the Second Court of Criminal in the case of the case of the division in which the brother of Ancient Monterrey was invited.
After care at Casino Royale Maintainer Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had asked to pay economic costs to allow the railway in Monterrey to allow illegal operations in the safe house.
After the public requirement, the State Procuration started a criminal excuse of the brother of the panist's old man. On September 2, he was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agency of the Public Ministry No. 3 was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antigo in the main city of the State.
In this place, the following 49 days after the second Regulation on the prison was issued and the Agency of the Public Ministry made the possibility of community or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transmitted to a criminal court in Cadereyt to submit to Casina Red officers a percentage of one and half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with a centrally severe examination because he had been raised to death.
The leaders allow him to stay in the cities in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, the command of arrest that gave the secretary of the Second Court of Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, which announced that at least two months of investigation was gathered together the evidence of the evidence that allowed Jonah's sin. For example, the replacement of 1,5 million peso to the Casine's expenditure is allowed by the operation.
This lunch is the legal ability of Casina Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, offered the judge Joseph Luis Pecin and requested mercy for the old brother of the region. On the basis of this, it will be possible to return to freedom.
While the legislation was committed with the Director of the Public Ministry, Ramiro Aria, asked Garcia Gomeze whether the challenges were corrected and who of the companions decided to have mercy.
On the basis of the Official Letter 197/2011, Jonasi Larazabal is made lawful kindness. In the process that was leading against it, it will not be possible to give any difficulty.
After translation with legal power at about 15:50, the Court urged the immediate release of Larrazabala Breton.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yanéz, came to the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to announce Jonah that he had been made official kindness and his case was sent to the archive.
He also announced that the Court had submitted a provisional Regulation on his remission.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jacome presented details about the aircraft accidents where the government's secret, Francisco Blake, and other seven persons.
The Secretary-General for Communication and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the investigation of the disagreements in which the secretary of the Government of Francisco Blake Mor and other seven others demonstrate that the officer has affected directly in the field of full power, and that no pilot should have the chance to try to attach the low approach.
On the print conference Dionisio Pérez Jacome, secretary for Communication and Traveling, said that before the aircraft, pilot constated that climate conditions are allowed to be able to.
"The parts that appear to be proved that the unit came sometimes to contact the territory, she fell into the floor of the trees of 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the trunk."
He also informed that the unit was defined for 19 persons, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transfer of the personnel.
In addition, he stated that, based on the investigation in the nearby area, there were no parts found on the land.
"For the search was found that the parts of the aircraft were not found in another place, then the aircraft was attached to the penny as a target.
"The officer was defined for 19 persons, fulfilled all the requirements for the transfer of persons.
Teren shows his skin with seven to thirty grades.
The secretary confirmed that in the present time it was the most important to get the most fastest results, but the investigation can keep a few months or a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the general director of air and support services announced that at the time of the nearby, the president of the General Stage moved the east speed and had a problem on a mixed remote territory.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it has been a regular aircraft operation during the period."
At the print conference of the SCT Officer Perez Jacome, Perez Jacome designed six basic investigation points:
Visual years:
In accordance with the aeroplanes, the years were performed according to the rules of the visual aircraft, it means that the airport should be seen at the ground during aeroplane.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports provide adequate conditions at the start, in accordance with this airport, the direction on border, between the DF and the Mexico States, were the relative levels in lower heights.
Selected tracks:
Probably, because the smoke was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavac valley.
The location of the narrow.
The coordinates of the narrow and the last record of the officer from the Council are agreed, it is likely that before the prison was not achieved to lose control or to disappear the aircraft.
The separation of the aircrafts on the border:
The information that we have in the present time is allowed to imagine that the narrow has arrived on equal tractors and from the side.
Nakares the floor of the aircraft's rebounds indicates that during the nearby on the Peninsula was a entist robbery.
He wasn't signed by explosion or explosion.
There were no evidence on the place of disease that would testify that it came to the exploitation or food.
The results of the investigation show that there could be a number of contacts with the firm.
During the territory work, the airspaces were found in high to 9200 feet above the sea, the territory is considered, the top of the steel goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the cases where it probably has been achieved by the detailed trains.
Information provides elements that, as it seems, indicates that the exploitator could get to contact the country in several places.
After a deficiency in the circumstances, in the field that is more common than the field of exhibition, there were no rests of the ransom found, which strengthens the idea that the ransom has arrived in the situation when the ransom was still complete.
The Mexican Health Agency started the research of the type that makes the observation
Health insurance Institute provides a research to find a gen responsible for children and employees.
The Mexican Health Agency (IMSS) announced that the research to be carried out by genes that cause children and young people. The research called "Genetic Observations in children and young people" allows you to get the results of the surveys.
In the report of the Research Medical Units in the biochemie area from the National Health Centre of 21th century, Miguel Cruz López explained that the multidisciplinary team was established by doctors, sisters, experts for food and social workers.
This team is concerned with the support of specialists and requests of post-gradual study from the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and from the Research Centre and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Politechnical Institute (IPN).
The study can also be a wide publicity that has or has no permissions. People can come to the participants with the IMSS Sport Center in Valle de Mexico, where each meeting will be conducted by 8 hours for younger tests.
He noted that the investigation started in the Sport Centre of Cuauhtemoc (Mexican State) and from 8 October this activities also carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sport Centre (Veiod Mexican State).
As data are received from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sport Independence Centre (except from the Federal District) and finally in the Sport Centre Morelos (secured from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the objective of this research is to determine the directorys and the significance of genetics, in the case of development of obsessions, and to explore mexic children and young people's risk factors and to prevent the impact of chronic degenerative disease.
In the opportunity of the International Diabetes on 14 November, he reminded that the goal is to gather data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with agreement and monitoring of parents, for the application of specific issues on exchange.
The questionnaire will also be asked for physical activities and family anomes of heritage diseases with a purpose to exceed risk factors that may cause disease as sugar or ledwin insufficientness.
He suggested that every Sabbath with all participants carry anthropometric measurement (water, height, height), blood pressure measures, is determined by glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulina and study genes (see to identify genes that are involved in the remote child obsession).
Cruz López pointed out that this research rejects the concerns of healthers over the alarming growth of children.
"Health Ankets held between 1999 and 2006 showed that only six years of the children have increased 77% and 47%. In dramatic growth, the MPSS was also in the case of overcome."
He pointed out that one of the reasons for the search of indicators is that the population of the country is different from the other population of its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexico has 65% of India-American genetic emissions, 30% of Europe and 5% African, and this fact is turned into genes responsible for diabetes and surveys.
He explained that generic genetic obsessions are usually explained as an incapable of exploiting the sustainable energy we consume (colories) and that is stored in the shape of woods.
The investigator explained that the right use of participants includes the total evaluation of the child’s status to find whether any knowledge of surveys or obstacles are shown.
He showed that even the presentness of the dark colors (acantosis) on the core and the preliminary indicates the probability that the given one will take the metabolic problems and the pre-carbon states.
The information is still confident, the doctors give it letterly to parents and explain to them all measures and changes of lifestyle that they have to carry out their children’s disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main folders that make surveys, observation and other chronic diseases: a seed way of life that indicates the absence of the day physical activities, the global visit before the TV and the use of transport media instead of a short distance.
It also makes a large calorical accommodation, it is a larger consumption of flashed drinks, uhlohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high content of tissues and proteins and genetic matters that are subject to this research.
In Asfalt with UNAM will not be exhausted
Rafael Herrera, scientist of the Chemical Faculty of UNAM creates modified asfalts with polymers and creates so much better function, independently on climate conditions and temperature
If it was correctly concerned, it would not be necessary to modify at least 200 thousand ices after each time of rain in the Valle de Mexico, Rafael Herrera Nayer, scientist of the Chemical Faculty (FQ), which also added that if the construction and the maintenance of the asfalt dealings were added, it would be a significant limit of exhaustion, or even if it could be possible to disappear.
In his proposal, the technical reason of the exhibitions that he had been presented in the International Year of Chemicals, he noted that the laboratory under his leaders have changed asfalts with polymers, which should have the amount of similar characteristics such as as asfalt, but also greater mechanical difference, as at lower temperatures, as well as at lower temperatures.
Mr. Naier believes that this kind of modified asfalts could be used in locations with extremely temperature climate, for example in some cities in the north country. It would improve the function and reduce the creation of the plants.
He explained that asfalt, the most difficult part of the skin is the buying molecules, the molecule with a large molecular substance that is called asfalten, and others with low molecule substances that are called maltenes. Asfalt adds a typical viskoelastic character.
Vicoelastic characteristic asfalt consists of a high temperature, around 180 degrees, belongs to the technology, at 120 degrees has high vicosity and at 50 degrees, at least in a constant state, while asfalt has tendency to be low.
This means that the asfalt difference in the streets is not unique, but in the day changes according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, he warned the chemical ingegnery.
The science of the Chemical Faculty observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered flexible for the creation of six grounds of materials of which three lasts are related to asfalt.
In the middle of the top levels, the asfalt entry is created by small chambers in the asfalt and then stealed.
He showed that every stone that creates an input is to make a asfalt.
When car or pressing, it is so possible that the powers are well distributed.
If it was about modified asfalt, it would be better, it would be a chemical ingegner.
He added that at the asfalt input, the last layer named plastic, created by a small stone, then a letter also in the asfalt.
In view of this plane will come to contact the vehicle raffles, it must have more mechanical power than asfalt entry and must ensure the car rental.
In view of that, as a part of the depth will be established, a large depth must have enough depth and must be taken attention to the material of which it is prepared.
Climates, particularly the profundity and temperature changes, are also very important factors that must be on memory. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of asfalt items.
As the territory is deep, the water is broadcast inside and it is hard to get out, it makes the smoking of all the layers for and the impact of the exploitation.
He explained that during the creation of the plots, he was like the first cutting of the plane and then comes to achieve the asfalt items. But it is not available at one moment, but it's a allowed process that should be stopped at the first characters using the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National Scientific System, he also explained that the car is another important factor in the creation of exploitation, and therefore the depth of each single levels must be responsible for the vehicles and must be concluded that it is unreversely, and that we can only refuse the periodic impact of the model.
Rafael Herrera noted that if it is about asfalt, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research at the beginning. For example, asfalt emuls that are already available in other countries and allows easily to edit efforts and we should not use high temperatures.
What happened to a candidate from Valle to become a new Miss Columbia?
The analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna did not get the corner of Miss Columbia.
The Valle has the title 14 of the first multimission.
The Valle del Cauca wasn't achieved again in the corner of Miss Columbia.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with the winning of her wind, received a silver corner and shirt, based on the first majority of Colombia.
On the basis of the earlier financial results in Cartagena, where she was winning and egged, Mrs. Atlantico, the first department received 14th more. Melina has been connected to women from Valle del Cauca, who have received a victorious corruption, but, finally, had been issued by the first majority of Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borre (1949), Patricia Belgia Ayala (1979), Lorenia Álavarez (1981) (1983), Mary Alza, Olte Arena (1987), Lennavia (1988), Blanca (1989), Eversale Macella (1989), Pennella (1992), Al-Geral, Al-Geralden (Grance) (1993), Al-1993).
What's wrong?
The result is, therefore, a great favorite that showed in all the previous colleges that she had to become a new Miss Columbia, and not soon became the King Police and the most fair face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have arrived for example Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which later have been submitted and the title of Miss Kolumbia.
One of the key factors who decided to be called it only First Multimiss, is the fact that she didn't pronounce her response to the question, "Who was the book most liked you and why?" which put Martin Murillo Gomez from the literary editor Leamos.
The candidate replied to the question:
"I believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the form of culture, and the book that most influenced me in the child was "Small Prince", very deep book.
This is a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors, one of the beautiful books called El Ardor de la sangre.
However, this answer was not pleased because of the term "culturalising" and the second because the candidate had not explained how the individual mixed books had been recognised.
After the end of the celebration ceremony, Melina announced that he was quiet and has a joy of the result: "The world is wise what is going to happen.
And you people, read if you can, the little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotic Newspaper stated that the candidate was the best, unbelievable and the one who took all the preceding prices (Gastronomic call Oster, public title for the best arterial clothing and the King's mother), raised the construction of other challenges, exceeded the Queen, who went up on the scene.
It was compared to the first presentation of a board on the board of Hilton and during two views before the final coronation.
Even when she cried on both, it was to know that she had mistaked her power and smoke, who had made a representative from Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, the newspaper "Come home" on Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has received the title of the first multimission confirms the fact that the candidate that has received the most titles at the time of the conference doesn't finally come with the crown of the Queen."
Furthermore, Valle was almost invisible to the medium, and it wasn't paid to him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince his interest in social work based on the National Court of Beauty.
On the border, two days before the election of the International Body of Lucy Doughty said they looked for a woman who would know the social needs of their country.
"In Mrs. Columbia's council, it's not enough to see anything more than just a physical beauty, it's necessary to focus on social feelings, it's important to the candidates before they enter into the concurrence, they were entered into such projects," explained.
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle has lost a point because of the loss of his background and the fibrose that was on the back, but it's totally in contrast with the worthwhile, which chose her mission "indigenous beauty" for the most healthy body, the right consumption and the responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernan Orosco, who prepares the Queen, recognizes that Melina was not the best body that there were the best girls, "but the problems with fibrose on the back that was not too known for my opinion, they took her points to the last day."
Meanwhile, the Guido Hoyos newspaper of Cromos believes that the family of the Valle has made a mistake when she had a few chirurgical procedures.
"Cirurgical principles are all right, but in the Valle they didn't agree.
The body never had her strong side, and she chose her dawn here."
For the reason of this evaluation, which the National Conference of Beauty was first made, after the overseer in the bowls, came to the cruel proposals that had been fulfilled. It was stated that this was the satisfaction that Raymund Melin was able to make it not to endure the highest corner.
If it is true or not, it is certainly that Melina has started the year of his domination today, not as a King, but as a prince, from the position that gives her the possibility of representation of Colombia on various international cohesions, where the National Court will be named only.
However, it was written in the history as one of the kings who were not able to get to the highest corners in Cartagen.
That was the work of Cali citizen who identified the death of Alfonse Can
Cali's officer's pressures came to his story as a man who confirmed the death "Alfonsa Can".
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4 of the lonely year, the officer at the pressure of CTI in Cali entered in the history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Can", and it was through comparison of the prints of the prints.
This week, with the seven officers on the cycles that work for the CTI section, was Eliazar González, men of Puerta Tejada, who works 21 years in the court research.
At the beginning of his carrier González worked on the council in Choco, where he had to spend more than five days in the field to get to the place where the dead were needed to identify.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle, and after he solved the relevant cow, he began specialising the pressures of the sticks, and this science is in the study of the cock crew, so for his hands and feet.
In the week when the operation was carried out against the Alfons Can, Eliasar said to take the clothes at least three days.
I was waiting for something big.
On the fifth night, he went out to Cauca in a pigeon from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead, and that he's sure one of them is a man who led the oldest gueril in the world. So they asked him to take a card with the prints of Guillerm Leon Saenze (the true name).
However, when he came with a investigator team to the place where she found a dead, he didn't recognize her because of physical examination, but he looked very different than in the community environments.
He didn't have yours, he was clothed as a bunch in the given area, without a shoe, a lot of shoe.
But the prints can't.
Along with a gallton lupoe, a test and a transplantator and the light of Eliazar began comparing the dactrine records of dead dead letters from the card.
The eye didn't look at her, it was Alfonso Cano.
In the same night, a man of the origin from Puerto Tejada was convinced to be defended, John Carlos Pinzono, confirmed whether he really acted on the Supreme Leader Farc.
Find Track
For the dactyloscope from Siyon de Cali is the recognition that Eliazar Gonzálezo showed President Juan Manuel Santos on the print conference of operational services against "Canovi" very significant.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactyloscope is an exatic science, without the possibility of errors, which can play a key role in decisions of criminal actions.
In addition to identifying deaths, these people help to investigate criminal acts such as a crime or a murder and confirm the identity of the victims.
When they are captured, many delivings represent false evidence or don't have papers.
We're going to get them the prints of the puzzle, and we'll find them in the database.
The investigator said that, in the case of a disaster, he had to remove the walls of the house, because he was struck in this place to get the treasury of full shoes and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not determined to retrieve prints, but in this case we could get the pressure of all the hands and identify the believer who shared in several crawls," he remembered.
In the case of a murder can also confirm or exceed subsequent subsequents.
Recently, they found a dead man with alcohol lake around themselves.
On the basis of the investigation, one of the family advisers could be responsible for murdering, and the pressure on the bed was truly confirmed.
Although it doesn't be able to confirm that he was really a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared to the crime scene.
The CTI officer explained that from the objectives, "searched by chemical or physical reactive substances."
When it appears, it uses the transplantator or the path for them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is the deliving database, or to the Registration.
"The problem is that in the present time there are more Colombias who have no data been taken," said the CTI representative.
He explained that it wasn't all as it was shown in the CSI television programme.
Like everything you're threatening, it's not gold, not all you're touching, they're staying.
However, if it may be used, the corresponding comparison must be carried out.
"Smoking" protests in New York.
The hundreds of demonstrators were intrigued on the subject of Zuccotti, where they wanted to establish.
A large part of them was waiting for the order of the space exhaustion and moved to the near park.
The members of the Department of the Wall Street were exposed in a struggle representative of New York, when the court tried to get back to Manhattan's theme from the morning. Then they tried to take another newyor park.
The hundreds of manifestants were pressed on the subject of Zuccotti, where they wanted to receive the court command that allows the "smoking" to stand back in the places. The second part of the smoking reacted to the exclamation because she took the park in the north city where he came to another arrest.
"If the judge doesn't allow us to go back to the destination, we'll sit in another place and continue in a legal battle with the purpose to return to Zuccotti, and as through the meeting, so peaceful demonstrations," said one of the words "We're going to go to Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray declared that the response "smoked" to the exploitation of the camp, Michael Bloomberg, came to the court where the judge Lucy Billings had ordered the violent exchange of places and allowed manifestants to stand there.
Nevertheless, the "shirts" was taken another park located on the central Canal Street and the sixth Avenue, close to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the pharmaceuts in Trinity Church.
At least for a hour, they were able to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some manifestants, but Bray didn't know the exact number, but he told him that he had seen that the pool was set up to some newspapers.
The Organisation ensures that some hundreds of people were sitting in the place, and also the delegation of religious representatives came to declare their support, and she also tried to deal with the police.
In the middle of the subject of Zuccotti, who is a private leader, remains closed, and he expects a judicial action to get just outside, and at any time it should be analyzed by the law of the morning evacuation.
Some of the replaced manifestants even developed and gave copies of the Court and even gave them to those who looked at the subject, which was called "a few small tribes", Bray, who rejected the fact that some police demonstrants had.
The Court commands the officers to exit members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" or to use "the laws that were published after the commitment began, or to disable manifestants to access to the park with business or other places which they used before."
Ancient Bloomberg introduced for the pressure that, in view of this court command, the city has stopped the opening of the public space and the manifestants noticed that local laws do not allow them to return states and spaces.
The highest representative of the city personally violated the early exhaustion of the subject of Zuccotti, the operations in which were arrested for 200 persons, and to which it was approached, because the manifestants "the law has violated."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the targets because it was "the place where people didn't go to protest, but to disturb the laws and in some cases to build others," because " Some businesses have received exhaustive letters" and "sounds were afraid of their quality of their life."
"The morning exclamation was worried and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests on the courage of the American worker people," added a steady, who convinced an elderly that you don't care the freedom of expression."
The Office of Wall Street also showed that they had the plan to organize the "great action" on fourth part in cooperation with the community and convention organizations to remember two months after which they remain protests. They began on September 17.

With Michael Buble and other significant Canadians will appear in the TV program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was a assistant Tima Allena in "Home Improvement", a boarder in "Baywatch", a "Playboy", a wife of an annual musician Tommy Lee, and now the heritage and the model will be Mr. Mari in the special military series of Canadian TV.
The private CTV TV station today announced that Anderson with the singing of Michael Buble and other significant Canadians will appear in the TV programme "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will celebrate Mrs. Marii.
CTV today showed a TV program in which Anderson, also known from the Internet pornographical homes, appeared with his old husband, "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as Mrs. Mary, who looks in a witch pancake that represents Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene Peters, a known Canadian Indian comic, which recently acted as a moderator on the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.

Japan's return to life after a painful landscape
HDP grows at 1.5% by the consumption of households and ends the period of feeding started in March
Since March of the Long Year, Japan's economy was paralyzed, now it returns from the worst landscape that has grown in nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the country has had to be caught from 2 of the World War.
The first toxic governments have calculated material losses for 300 million dollars, the morning, which is increasingly increasingly difficult global situations.
After three four-year fees, the HDP value of the HDP between June and September was able to turn the page: HDP increased to 1,5% in comparison to the fourth and 6% of the year.
The results of the second fourth year - for Japan's payment year begins in March 2012 - also provides the greatest growth in comparison to the period of January to March 2010.
Life may be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary for the renewing areas of destroyed agricultural and follow-up tune.
The companies increased their investment to 1,1%, the expenditure of 0,9% of the periods of ship to March. One of the first pole after six months of unexpected growth is one.
However, the real development of Japan's economy is explicitly out of the impulse that allows us to use the crisis to send out of it or to re-infrastructure.
Japan has been established, especially by the development of home consumption which presents 60% of the Japanese HDP.
This variable has increased 1%, thanks to increase the expenditure on vehicles, paths and free-time activities.
Stigma Yenu
Toky was attached to the internal market when the Japanese variation became one of the "safe values" for investors who fled from a long-term crisis from the eurozone and the worried prognoses of the United States, and it is the privilege that is, in particular, a major interest for export businesses.
With stronger changes, products in the frontier are greater than negative for the country which economics are determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony counted their weak results in July to September until September.
While the markets are still covered by the EU border countries, the governor Yoshiko Noda is obvious.
"We need to take attention to risks that survive as the destruction of some foreign economys, the impact of the impact in Thailand and the rapid increase of Yeun," said the State Secretary for the Economic Policy of Motohis Furukawa.
And actually, perspectives are not rebuilding.
The Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OECD) concluded that most Member States have shown clear signs of economic respiration in September.
The indicator who prevents the independence in the world economy showed that the economy of the main powers is declined.
She rolled about four decades at 100,4 points in August.
The Eurozone has even been achieved under a average of 100 levels, and it has been 99,13 points.
Athens are again widespread.
Papadimos says that they will be approved, but the concerts do not support any written obligations
The Greece continues to pay more to the labyrint, which leads to the exit of a large debt crisis in Europe.
The case that the New Transport Greek Government 's 's 's 's 's 's 's 's requests of Brussel than by the real political reputation of powers is beginning to confirm.
While the new emphasis, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday allowed to have no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days that he received in his name would probably be short for their application, President of Conservative Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new supporting measures in any case should not be supported and repeated its request for the exposure of new options on the date of 19.
"The main task of this Government is to apply a summary decision of 26 October," announced Papadimos yesterday during the Parliament's debate, which explanes the vote to the Government tomorrow.
The challenge with 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the disciple code of the officers and the new measures against payment efforts will be between the first initiatives.
However, Samarase report doesn't explain the doubts about his position: "We have come to help the transitional government, but we have no more agreed."
The President of the Conservatives came to the EU and the MMF address a little far, and these organizations have to block 8 billion which Atane needs, but he also announced that it does not support and does not support any obligation to implement the measures.
The European Commission was already distributed by the impact that Papendre had made the reference games yesterday, noticed that its requirements were irrelevant: it does not block any assistance if the new government and representatives of the main parties are not described "the written obligation without doubleness and whatever possible."
The speaker for economic interests, Amadeu Altafai, explained that inspectors from Troyka will return "before soon" to Aten and will handle with the new government about "what needs to pay the sixth parts" 8 billion. The definitive date but there is no existing.
Greek friends have a minute for what we're going to do.
King Sophie: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The King exchanges the original position of Spain in relation to this type of financial
Spanish "the significant position on global levels on micro-financing".
King Sophie remembered yesterday that the country became a second gift of the planet, whereas it is about this cooperation tool, which is based on the means of social progress, justice and hope for the best future for the world. It is a tool based on trust in humans.
The Queen started the 5th world micropowers in Valladolid with the convinced that "no doubt" that this kind of operation is "except necessary" to achieve the centuries of thousands of years that have established the United Nations for 2015. "In particular, the fulfilment of the objectives that have to be achieved to reduce the half of people who lived with less than one dollars in the day, so with a part of the one who creates a piece of pounds."
Spanish "I will continue to work" and expand the network of the welfare "in all coats of the planets and take this job responsiblely," she showed the King Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and the accession of the Sumitite, which will end up to the fourth, "search the creation of best capacity and opportunities for the most important and especially for women" who are the initiatives and the initiatives of the Sumitite, which are particularly defined.
"We've got a lot of people" and "More calls are still before us."
The summary of microphotos should be not only a diskused form but also a platform that supports "based targets".
Her Majesty explained that the goal was to have access to these financial services until the end of 2015 175 million of poverty families and to reach 100 million families on the work of poverty in which they live immediately.
The Concept of the Micropolis in Spain and in other countries of the world has expanded after, "What happened on this path, the superintendent of Muhammad Yunus," brought the Queen and added that it was "the act of righteousness and the needed recognition."
The father of this tool described as a "increasing idealist who went on the path of battle against the poor." His work was known for 15 years ago when he went to Bangladesh to meet him directly in the place of his politician.
After this experience, the first world summit in Washington and another meeting, for example, in the Northern Sealand in 1999, in Canada, in 2006. "For all these hundreds, I could consistently develop unexpectedly, the Queen explained that the project has served yesterday the title of "the head of the family", which made it in Valladolidu.
King Sophie concluded his exemption by calling the participants to enter into the debate and search for the solution and allow them to continue to fight the poverty.
"Etical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, announced that solidarity is "the ethical imperative", which has to be guided to all democratic States.
In this meaning, she said that it would be a mistake to cooperate with developing countries only with the balohobyte period because this cooperation is "permanent obligation".
Jimenez is considered that the micropowers represent the "serial and potential policy to remove poverty" and now more than ever before the rules of developing countries must work in accordance with solidarity criteria and disappear to solidarity to be victims of slaughter.
For Spain, a micropower is one of the main development lines of cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, announced successs that served the concept based on that we give confidence to the people that all others close the doors. Starko Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva attended participants in the city that "opens his doors of solidarity, which is sofortable."
The CDU proposes to vote to the European President based on the general election law
Without serious difficulties for the officer and president of the Christian Democratic Party of Angel Merkelo, on Monday 14 November in Lips, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe on the programme was not originally, but it was even at the past, especially to be satisfied by members who consider the policy of the Government today in Greece and maymorrow before Italy.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission was at least adopted.
Only nine of the number of 1001 delegateds were against, and 10 delegates were maintained.
A number of chemical eggs stand on the end of Angely Merkel's exhibition and takes a few hours later Wolfganga Schäubla, a very proper European Finance Minister, was not left for doubts.
The main thinking of officers and proposals can go to the Slogan: "No less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "9 million of workplaces are directly in euro."
According to the offices in Europe, "the time has been changed."
This could be considered amendments in the Treaty of Lisbon to send the control of the European Union on the payment policies of the Member States of the European countries, but it could also be made to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the universal election law "with the purpose of a European afar."
This is, in each case, one of the proposals of the accepted congress, which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It's probably not likely that all twenty-seven countries are on this revolutionary step are quickly agreed: against the United Kingdom and the directors of the CDU think that we also take the same position to Nicolas Sarkoza.
But the direction is cut off.
The delegates also rejected the greatest proposal to determine the weight of each country in the representation of the European Central Bank in accordance with its economy's weights, which is obviously exhausted in the transfer of Germany.
The officer made a number of references to the Conrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kohla. She was not trying to get the congress to speak about the "little" European States or States that are in difficulties to criticize an aggressive Germany.
The proposal for Europe is required for a paragraph of the importance of the "Francio- German friendship", Angela Mercel France was not cited.
It's just an enemy.
When she remembered that it was just two hundred years ago, she had a blood fight at Lips.
In fact, it was one of the most courageous assaults of the Popeline Army.
What does the weakness of the worklessness?
After supports, the UMP and the Government of the Offensies against the worklessness are launched.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be visited on 15 December in Bordeaux and visited the authorities for social support, where the subject was made on the subject on combating society and reform of solidarity from 2007.
As the implementation of this ofensies, which goes out of the desire to carry out business in the context of a higher presence, but nothing is less clear from the view of the rule of the President's campaign, is the legal majority wants to focus on the worklessness.
First, because of payment supports, the Government wishes to ensure the employees of the private sector of the fourth day of worklessness before they start support in the disease.
Of course, without a competent agreement, the employer who is sick would lose four days, so at least 15% of his month adoption.
measures that are risked to make a lot of bad blood, but, according to the list of Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
In addition, measures to be carried out by further symbolic advance measures: to give to the State employees a day of unemployment unemployment (which they still have no possibility to reach three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of the debate, the real majority also starts the subject of the suits this time to crimes associated with worklessness.
"The controls will be more easier and more: if you are attached, you will be returned," advised Xavier Bertrand at the conversation of the RTL state offered on 13 November.
As in other cases, the notification effects seem to be inadequated with regard to the truth of crimes in worklessness.
These were actually the subject of permanent monitoring since 2002 and the political relationship that brought their fruit.
France is not more sick than anywhere in Europe.
Let's stop in some of the official numbers first.
According to Caisse’s national health assessment (CNAM - State health insurance), there was more than 237 million euros in 2006.
According to the French Agency for Research and Health Documentation, in 2008, their 11.3 billion of euros were 5 per cent of the health.
In this part, 46% related to maternal contributions and employment rates and 54% related to employment capacity, e.g. 6,2 billion euros.
So only 2,5% of health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting group studies, France had a average of 14,5 days of work in the year 2009.
The average that hides certain delays: another anket published in 2007 on workshops with Monster.com showed that 75% of 40,000 français employees were responsible for no working day.
Other studies, this time carried out by disease insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37,8% of worklessness was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% remained long.
When we compare them with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more than any of the worklessness.
A long study conducted in 2010, two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that the total absence between 1994 and 2001 (of health reasons or nivs) has increased in France between 10% and 11,8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 18% in the Netherlands.
The conduct of worklessness is only a very small part of the work on black.
If it's about the ground, they're just a small area.
The submission of legislation from 2002 has been made that there are systematic controls intended to work insufficientness less than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM concluded that at 1,5 million controls, 13,8% of 285,000 carried out because of the short-code inability "injusted or too long", e.g. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled inability of less than 45 days, 11% of the cases “incompatible or unjusted” were calculated at 1,2 million controls, e.g. 132 000.
The total of 169,000 "injusted" cases for several million employees who had worklessness.
The number that represents much less than the number of printing work on black.
According to the UMP Dominiquea Tiana sentence of the June report on this question, this number would be represented to 9 to 15 billion euro failure in the choice of a year, such as more than all the highest day reviews and, therefore, more than the supply associated with the last mentioned.
Papdemos: Greece must apply a new saving plan
Greece will need a new saving program to renew its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Lucas Papademos had submitted these words to the President of the Ministry and added that hundreds of days of his government would not be fulfilled by this task.
"To restore our economy's feet, we need support of our European partners and the new safe budget plan," reported the boss of the Government when he was in the middle of his first public statement at the beginning of the debates to vote on confidence in the Parliament.
The payment of the decisions adopted on 27 October in the eurozone summary will be the "the main task" of the new government, for in the game it is to participate in our country in the euro area.
Following that, Mr. Papademos suggested that the public deficit of the country will be from the end of the year "in about 9%" of the severe home product after 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
Practice rejects new competent measures
The Leader of the Rights of Antonis Samaras offered his support to already approved measures to try to decline from the long-term crisis, but noted that his side is not addressed to any additional effort measures.
"We don't take any new hand measures," advised Samaras to meet the messengers on his side of the New Democracy.
We agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting against the depth, but we are against any political policy that would prevent economic survival.
Mr. Olli Rehn, the European Economic and Monetary Commissioner, which warned that the MMF and the EU are not locked on the required rate of 8 billion euros without writing to all the parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word is sufficient and that it does not support anything under the external click.
It is necessary to legalize etangacy and assistance to self-assistency, says the Commission of experts.
According to the reports of the Canadian Canadian company, the death was taken to Canadians.
In the situation of the political care, the Commission requires the ability to provide governments, health institutions and doctors to work together in order to ensure the best political care and also in cases of sanity.
Canadian society lives a thought of death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually accepted to talk to the doctor about conditions in which they want to die and accept decisions in this meaning.
This is one of the extents of the reports of the King Canadian Company, which shared six experts of work in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends the Government to amend the criminal law so that the assistance of self-assistency and etangazia should be allowed if this option is as necessary for the patient considered for competent acceptance of such decisions.
At the beginning of experts, the recent anchet of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Canadian has been located on the 10th place, the study notices that "the medicinalisation of death in Canada has caused the culture where people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or not, 77% of the Canadians have no access to the political training, they share experts with the Mandat of the Canadian Company.
And through the dead house that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is paid for the whole Canada, while this number is the highest number of 86% dead in the hospital.
In the case of the delicious question of ewanazie and assistance of self-assistency, the carriers of the reports are to be concluded against the federal government's position, which has already said that no changes on the criminal law on the ewanacy and assistance murder.
According to experts who also control all countries where these accesses are legalised or not considered criminal cases, there is no evidence that this decrimination causes some disagreements in the application, such as in the practice of ewanasia or assistance to ungodly or incompatible persons.
In addition, p. Jocelyn Downie, the composer of the report, confirmed yesterday at telecommunication more than reading cases in countries where the ewanazie and the assistance murder is not legalised.
"Etangazie is running in Canada, where it is just illegal."
"Assistant self-seed is also executed in Canada where it is uniquely illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are cloned by etangazia
Remember that, according to the monitoring of Angus Reid forum in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already been expressed in use of ewanazie, because they believe that the allowed persons to the end of life to disturb their suffering.
And 66% believes that legalization of ewanazie does not mean that we send a message about that life of old or individuals have a lower price.
In case of persons who act assistance to self-controlled, 41% of the questioned persons judge that they should not be judged.
In the case of holding or interruption of patients, the situation is less clear, says the cars of reports.
In the list of their recommendations, they also propose that it should be in the criminal law indicated that the disagreement of the treatment for which it exists rightly confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission also requires that the experts should be trained to respect the rejectment of treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal disasters.
In the situation of the political care, the Commission requires the ability to provide governments, health institutions and doctors to work together in order to ensure the best political care and also in cases of sanity.
Finally, in the case of the political or final effort already used in Canadian health devices, the Commission requires that it is considered at a moment when it is not necessary to reduce physical pains, equivalents, and to maintain the same procedures.
Recommendations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already published their expenditures relating to the conclusions of the reports of the experts of the King Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist on medical law, qualified the position of experts as "external" in other ways because it does not limit the practice of equivalents to the disease in the final phase.
"This opens the door to the situation when everyone who would have been launched with life and who would have more than 18 years, could ask him to help kill himself," says Peter Deschamps, who was studying repeated reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also understood that it seems to be like the authors of the reports to establish autonomy persons above all other values that create social priority of the company.
Because "in society, there are wonderful tags and limits."
The specialist of the Medical Rights of Margaret Somerville also declared the "functional measures to conclude the report that he qualified as "manifest for etangazie".
Margaret Somerville, who is the same member of the Canadian Company, is particularly surprised of reports relating to the absence of surprises in some countries where the ewanazie and assistance murders are legalised, including in the Netherlands and in the United States of Oregon.
The Jordan King calls President Assada to reject
Damashk's talking about "Complot".
Serie is more isolated
Students of Bashara al-Assada showed yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressures were intensified on Siria, President Bashara al-Assada, who spends them with the Russian support and talks about the "complaint" against his country.
Two days after the remaining Member State of Siria in the Arab States, the European Union sent his sank against Damage, while Turkey and Jordan, the Siria country, took the opinion in the effort of the challenge of President Asada.
Jordan King Abdallah II was yesterday the first governor of the Arab State, who called President Basharah al-Assad to be killed in Siria, where about 40 civilists and members of the military forces were killed."
"If Bachar had interest in his country, he would have to give demis, but he should also create conditions necessary for the new fase of the Syrian political life," said the king Jordan, the country in Siria, in the interview for the BBC state.
At his side, the chief of the Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davidgol politished that the efforts of the Turkish media to the Syrian system undertaken since the beginning of the year were not corrupted.
"They who are in the Middle East in peace with their people and can't be happy, they're gone" he spoke with a ship on the Seven Syrian, which Turkey applys what is more stronger line.
The United States enjoyed the "consensus against Assado and the unpotential operation of Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab States and the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the European Union, the Liga of the Arab States, the country as Turkey applies the more severe tone" by the repression in Siria, noted Mark Toner, speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced, during this time, Dera was lost in the south of Siria of 16 civilians and 19 members of the provisional forces.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civil persons have been lost by tracks and middle shopping from the hard colommets in the city of Jobar's area in Homs.
However, at the Syrical Conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Walid Moual declared that the country was "reached out of the crisis".
Recently, he also reacted to the decision of Liggy of the Arab States to stop Damascus, which represents a "safe step".
Serie's not closed, he added to the "Complots that are not successful against Siria."
Following its decision to leave the Sirian Member State to discuss in the present Liga of Arab States "Mechanism of civil protection" and to send 500 human rights, newspapers and military observers to the country in the plan.
The French Ministry of the Republic of Alain Juppae is also aware of the thinking of the United Nations observators to help protect civil persons before the repression of the regime, which seems to be "paranoid".
The new special meeting of Liggy is invited tomorrow to Rabatt to adopt a view to the plan on the resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December, and in which the army was intended to be carried out of the cities followed and the freedom of prisoned manifestants.
The Russian Ministry foreign Sergei Lavrov considered the decision yesterday by the Ligy of the Arab States 'false', while China ordered Siria to take the crisis to resolve, but it was therefore a full support of case sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices after Italec
The next Italian boss of Mario Monti requested markets for a little time to create his team and to start implementing the program that will contain the "offers" to reach the confidence lost in the last months of the Government of Berluscon.
He was a European Commissioner yesterday discussed with the political parties before meeting the employees and employees today.
It should be set up a relatively smooth cabinet based on the technologies not to the Parliament's parties.
"Multi talked about the important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, an apostle of one of the reading parliamentary groups of participants with discussions, after meeting with the designed Ministry President.
The Chairman of the Poland of Gianfranco Fini hopes that Mario Monti requests the Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation ends by Mario Monti by the representation of the small team of 12 President Giorgia Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented the nervousness on financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
"The Democracy pays exact terms" in the case of the preparation of government and its programme, he raised and added that the markets will be sustained and understood."
His name was adopted by the President from the beginning of the time, but the worst was revealed after the unexpected unexpected conclusion of the industrial products in the euro area.
The named Ministerial Chair should establish a team in particular technical, although he understood that he would like to accept the "policies".
He declared that the new government was held up until 2013, including the date of the following elections.
According to the Chairman of the Poland, the new Government of Gianfranca Fini will be trusted in the Parliament to the fifth.
Mario Monti promised that he would act with a marginal ability and the goal to become Italy's strong article "Europe".
The European Commissioner of Olli Rehna showed that "i with our new government's diagnosis of Italian economy."
The European Union is convinced that Rome will not obtain its objective for a balanced budget in 2013 and requires new significant measures.
The Chef of the Confindustria Confindustria, who is in the town of Montim, has been intended to relive the economic or country that does not show growth, could not keep the deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, an older European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his famous knowledge and independence," Professor" symbolising the authors of the leaders' expression to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "economic change" after 17 years" berlusconism."
The big unknown time of his team's life.
President Napolitan would like to examining the previous elections, for Italy must place the State debates for 200 billion euros until April 2012.
The Soviet Scientific Helped Iran's nuclear programme
The Soviet Scientific Vijaszlav Danielko helped Iran to issue the detonator useful for atom weapons, reported in an alien American non-governmental organization specialised on atom risk.
The Science and International Security Institute (ISIS) shall be addressed on the recent report of the International Agency for Atom Energy (MAAE) and other unique documents from this United Nations Agency.
The last week, MAAE has made its “great concern” if it is“the potential military dimension” of the Iran nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS institution, the largest of the MAAE documents would be V. Danilenko (nr. 1934) had to work three decades since the sixty years in the Soviet military research center in Celjabins (Ural) where the production of synthetic diamants of the exploitation method.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre had to leave the centre to establish a manufacturer company in Kiev."
His economic difficulties had to bring him to contact the Iranian majority in Ukraine in 1995.
Before he returned to Russia, he had to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iran program.
In his last report, MAAE reminds the clear data of the development of the detailed Iran's detailed system" out" from the work of a foreign specialist who didn't only know this method, but who, as a Member State of the Agency informed, was working during the essential part of his work carriers on this technologie in the framework of the military nuclear programme."
Protimuslimic criminal actions and degrees of 50%
According to the Statistics of the FBI published in the Sunday, the number of criminal acts and delicts of muslims increased at least 50% from 2009 to 2010, while the other race and religious violence were in the same time low or few.
According to these numbers, the total number of violence against muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, including 49% increased progress in 13% in violations against Catholics, increased by 4% in transgressions against the Jews and the total nature of 14% in contradiction of crimes and delicts.
The entire number of "negative criminal acts" has been very easy to 6,628 cases from which 47,3% were raised by the FBI and 20% of religious differences.
"After the inhabitants in 2009, the human rights of First is renewable to see these criminal actions and degrees again," the organization of human rights First is increasingly significant," added the organization in his communication.
"Human Rights First a long-term pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of odd criminal acts, must be considered seriously dismissed by human rights," adds one of the leaders of the organization Paul Legendre.
"American government can and must be done more to join with these crimes," adds and rejects that this could be improved by the police reports of "negative criminal acts."
"Onnamental criminal action" in American federal law is inherited during the battle for civil law.
This legal line was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish violence connected to race, colour floor, religion, origin and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The web page offering microblog services has introduced changes in the design in order to allow its users to observe the activities of followers, whereever she likes her Facebook services.
New menus "activity" and "name" allow better and directly to know the activities of other persons who are looking for you or persons whose answers are "tweets".
This allows you to know whether they can monitor the articles, if they apply to the new accounts, whether they have favorite articles, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested in August for a small percent of users" before it was expanded in the whole network, the AFP agent said to Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known by his little instinctive function, with some of the incomprehensive terms (RT for the reacted extension of the assistance of someone else, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) makeing the welcome of the initiatives, opens a larger public with a more comparable manner and the larger Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network of users immediately in their "tweets" differently raises the significance of this innovation.
"It's enough, it's killing a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @ymb123.
"The Function of Action will help me look for some of my Twitter elements," sent @dannykronstrom.

registration of the golden rules on the equivalenced budget in the institution
The Government of the Great Social Democratics and Christian Democratics, which is in Rakous, decided in an urgently to write the "profit rule" budget policy in order to reduce the public deficit and to decline such as possible to reduce the assessment of the Raking Rating Agencies (AAA).
It was the social democratic officer Werner Faymann, who announced this decision to conclude the Council of Ministers in the situation when the Rakia public debt is with its 74.6% higher than the criteria of the Maastricht Agreement, but much less than the longer countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Rakish solvency was reduced only one grade from AAA to AA+, we should be paid every year for three billion euros more," argumented multicancer and ministre foreign, Christian Democratic Michael Spindelegger.
In this regard, the Court considers the request of a summary of the eurozone referred to in Brussels 26 October 2011, where the bodies and governments were directly requested to reduce the public deficit and to achieve the equation of public accounts in the statue or to the law.
The availed racist government tool is close to the " German model", Germany was the first European country that has received such "government".
The public structural deficit shall be held each year of 0,75% of the huge home product (HDP), and the public structural deficit of the federal State shall not be able to move any year to 0.35% HDP, while the community countries, as well as foreign countries, shall be expressed as a balanced budget.
The objective is to be achieved in the range of 2020/21, under the criteria of 60% of the Maastricht Treaty.
Power only
Node is a serious new intervention on deviation markets
The Japanese Ministry President Yoshiko Noda warned that Japan's institutions should be replaced on the devises markets if they should only continue to strengthen.
"Let's think how we've done this last time, if we're finding a very disagreement," in the change course of it, he explained the Senator Y. Noda.
Once again, the history values that have used Japan's authorities to intervene in October 31.
The day Tokio sold the ones for a dollar to reduce the value of the Japanese measures that recently completed the records of the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since that time, the purchases of investors who consider it as a "safe stage" in the most recent world's economic respiration and the European crisis made by the commitment.
The dollar was reached under 77, and the euro was cut down under the symbolic board 105 only close to the field, which the last intervention was called.
Before financial crisis in 2008-2009, $120 only and EUR more than 160 alone.
This replacement of Japan's measures fair to the island export, because it reduces the price of Made in Japan and reduces the value of the expenses received by Japan's foreign companies when they are carried out to home mines.
"Japanese is repeated" with a violation of married agricultural agricultural and volunteer tunings that revealed Tohoku in the northern country, the Y. Noda, who is afraid that this delivery would not be killed yet in the flock of crucial survival.
The third economic power of the world has renewed in the third quarter years of growth (1,5% in respect of the previous fourth year) and it is first in one year through the export growth and the consumption of households that are concerned.
However, the President of the Ministry urged that the higher value of it was not elected by the "National Economic of Japan".
The Japanese Financial Ministry of Jun Azumi called the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), who started in a two-day meeting of his political and ministry Council to adopt all possible measures to lead to them.
But the multi-governmental guarantee of this Institute Hirohide Yamaguč warned that BoJ had already adopted "compatible measures" that indicated that no additional changes can be expected in the middle.
At his last meeting at the end of October, 5 billion billion of soldiers (47 billion euro) increased its purchases of State posts and increased to 55 billion (519 billion euros) party of the party that carried out various price papers to pay liabilities.
Eurozone:
Shooting, shooting, shooting
The risk of the risk of the crisis is still undercovered by the European indicator.
At the name of the new bodies of Government in Greece and Italy and the better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the railways continue in their growth.
The European builds are still worried because of the stability of the euro zones today in August 15, November, to negative expectations.
In Paris in 10 hours CAC index 40 losses 1,4% at 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt is lost 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"Only, with a new review of costs from the half of the eurozone states, which are in difficulties, and the markets with actions in the world are only part of recent ships."
"The rural investors only recognize the risk of instructions," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets, citated agent Reuters.
The Burza in Tokyo was cut down with 0,7%, which has suffered because of the fear of the market participants on Europe's capacity to conform with a significant crisis.
"Japanese, as the rest of the world has eyes covered in Europe and the change will continue only in the intense variation coridor until the investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, the fund manager of the Midwich Investment Management.
This restart is not achieved in respect of the future of the Eurozone, the same change that continues in the field.
Euro is achieved at the least level since a month and half.
In 10 hours, the value of $1.3570 has the value of $0.4%.
According to the maclers, the CDU officers of Angely Merkels on their congress have adopted the proposal for the proposal to exit from the euro areas for countries that are concerned in difficulties and should not therefore have to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates remotely 6%
The officers in Italia and Spain remain on a very worried higher.
Tomorrow, the expenditure of Italian decades has 6,85% and the increase of Spanish decades is 6,2%.
This enforcement of the market participants is further strengthened in the southern European countries, but also in France.
The Boss of the future Italian Government Mario Monti was directly requested for the market time to ensure that the situation in Italy could be raised by the highest of its debt.
The New Greek Ministry President Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October in the euro area will be the "the main task" of his government.
Spain is again in the middle direction of markets when the country is in the week-day choices in a post-shirt dream.
The difference of sazeb ("spread") between the decades of Germany and Spain has received a new historical maximum.
In expectation of the numbers of reporting amounts of eurozone growth
Statistic numbers say that France has recorded the economic growth in the third quarter year of 0,4% of the preliminary consumption of households, including a bit better than expected growth of 0,3%.
The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE, however, revised directly under the numbers for the second fourth year at 0,1% of HDP instead of stagnating.
And in fact, it's the fourth year, which's the most worried economy.
From its side during the period of Germany, the growth of 0,5% was registered.
The first euro zone is expected for 11 hours, while the European Commission just warned the risk of new resources.
Energy policy:
the facts have to win over dogmats
If there is a subject that cannot understand on the basis of short-code developments or under emotions, it is an energy policy.
Availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the companies' power and competitive capacity.
It is natural that meetings in choices are the opportunity to think about such inputs and the place that uses nuclear energy.
Debates will be successful only when all the results of economic, social and environmental opportunities are investigated.
France must establish their positions on objective facts and racial data.
It's still on the planet of 7 billion people's lives, but the demographic development will choose a depth for the 2050 series of questions after electricity, if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to save the important part of life.
At the same time, it is necessary to achieve the absence of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and it cannot therefore forget the necessary need to reduce the emissions of plants that cause the purpose of combating climate changes, which is the subject that is currently from the ecological debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And therefore, Germany remains alone in his decision to deny nuclear energy.
However, it is not a case of Belgium that underlines its decision of the need to find a different source of replacement to himself, nor Switzerland, which considers the right establishment only the last generation of electricity.
In addition, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with decisions in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand their park on one unit to rebuild one electricity interrupted after the airport of Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy sometimes is presented as a example, reality reverses it.
The Berlin choice is shown by the reduction of electronic prices, increased energy compliance on the floor imported in particular from Russia, a high-creasing rate of CO2 emissions electronic equipment on the ground floor and air.
All these inadequate effects are already feeling for a few months.
The case of Danish serves us to think about him.
The European champion in wind electrics, from which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest carbon consumers and plants due to the injustice of the wind, because CO2 emissions are higher than 65% and the Danish electricity prices are higher than the European average.
In addition, our energy policy will pay our neighbor factor for electricity about 40% higher than how much French households pay.
While the globalised economy of energy costs constitutes the key factor of competitive capacity and the maintenance of the industry on the national territory, the French businesses use the costs of the best electricity in Europe.
For this reason, each significant reduction of nuclear energy would be called for a strong increase of the price of electricity, which would be made by an illustrating beautiful declaration of re-industrialisation of our country and the protection of buying powers.
The price that the major majority of France refuses to pay, as essentially not against this energy, as shows the investigation of public measures.
Remember that the energy policy has allowed our country to set a 125,000 direct workplaces and 410,000 workplaces.
The strong exporting sectors are able to achieve a large number of small and medium-specialised companies of workplaces that cannot be transmitted to the border.
If France decided to leave the nuclear, it would offer a few numbers of these small and central companies and would come to 6 billion euros for year, which the country is achieved for exporting nuclear equipment and services.
Which electronic leader would commit a nuclear reactor so that he would work 60 years while his manufacturer would be planned?
When energy equation solutions, it is necessary to allow that there is no fuel source for energy production, or that there is no devil.
Development of low CO2 emissions, nuclear equipment and renewable energy resources carried out by the French industry AREVA tests the complementary energy resources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest safety level.
In France, we have the State Agency for nuclear security that leads a non-compromised and transparent monitoring on staying nuclear electronics as well as on the establishment of new electricity in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognized have the idea of safety in blood.
For fifty years, he knew the nuclear industry three serious hazards.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred in the conditions of normal operation and remained without human sacrifices and results for environmental environment.
In the Blackwalk drama, the concept of the reactor and the human inappropriate errors had been made.
In the case of Fukusyma, some of them seem to forget that the hazard was the result of two natural catastrophes in the unprecedented range of 10 thousand persons.
The nuclear industry takes the learning of this holiday as he did at the two previous.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities who live with nuclear security, managers and constructors is that the EPR type reactor represents concepts to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to achieve such.
While all interesters who want to establish a nuclear electricity, they consider it, the establishment of its design in Flamanville would be a great gift for the AREVA group and the EDF company and the freedom of the way to strengthen the direction of nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to search for the best energy solution for our country, but it would not be responsible for emotions, dogmatas and machines to control the debatte so decided for economic, social and financial situations.
Is it for the economy of migration or opportunity?
The migration policy understood by Nicolase Sarkoziho was criticized from various urgents - deployment of police, courts and administrative policies, compatible with this policy with the State of Human Rights, which is in France.
Recently, it was a administrative disagreement that was an object that was a foreign student who became the current officer (see Liberation from 23 May) announced that France does not need other talents, officers and services."
But it was only sometimes decovered under the economy.
Notice says that in this area there is a large agreement between the left and the right.
In the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac announced his statement that "900000 unemployed would not be a problem in the country where two million employees of immigrants are located" and on the left Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France could accept all the world."
The only difference is the magnitude gradient
In 2005, there was fear of the invasion of the invasion of the Poland towns in the French territory shared on the right and left.
In both campaigns, the immigrants are considered as a share of economic and French society.
The only difference is increasingly increasingly, which we will make the immigrants to provide.
In his programme, Francois Holland is limited to banality when he says that the common development is allowed to resolve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a smoking and a problem may be paid in choices, economically, but very dear.
How the Economic Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remember in their recent publication of the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definite Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 s.): between specialists there is a wide consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, migration and employment in countries which migrants are achieved.
Limitation of the immigration protects growth and disagreements of employment.
The concerns of the events of the migrants are based on the thought that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their country.
But the experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than the French employees to do work in sectors with loss of employees.
Nearly qualified imigrants in sectors which do not apply French employment, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not sufficient to offer.
Positive impact on the grounds
As the chirurg will have difficulties to work in the country where anesthiologists are not retained, these completion between France and migrants make that the arrivals of the imigrants have positive impact on the fields and the employment of French employees.
John Peri thus counted that the growth of migration movements of 1% would choose the increase of real mixtures between 0,6 and 0.9%.
However, it is not the fact that the difference of the immigrants contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (the highest part of the naturalized immigrants between the American Nobel neighborhood prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based on imigrants).
The migrants are also in Europe's pure countries assistance to social systems in average of 1% of the full budget.
The World Working Organization, for example, declares that one immigrant in Germany will be brought for the life of his life to the public budgets (e.g. 150000 euros) in the Germany.
Nicolas Sarkozy told the beginning of his mandate to get up for an unexpected percentage of growth"s exceeding dawns."
The remarked dawns that served to distract the immigrants had just an effect increasingly.
Europe has found democracy, remaining to think of the European Democracy
Democracy is amazing and very cruel riches.
The European Continent should remember that, although it was in Athens two thousand years ago, he had been raised through the XX century tragedy of world wars, total systems, holocausts, golgues, but also France in Spanish, Salazar in Portugal and Greek.
Some people could believe that to finally triumph the democracy over their enemies would be sufficient to exercise the choice and to execute it in a way that is the best way.
Nevertheless, Napoleon is already known that it was easy to think.
The universal choice law, which is required of the democracy, is not sufficient and can be the "abusing tool" as ever said the Republican philosoph Ettienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: public space, public spirit, values, separation organization and control of power, education, lightness, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we live is a critical economic, but it is just as and from the beginning of the political and democratic crisis.
The recognition of the Greek Referency type is no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-night of the value of two depends on the need of the great political return, but also declines the worried poverty of his impossible, its independence.
This ambivalence must be considered to be convinced.
The fact is that the front lines of democracy have been transmitted today and that many of the Republican fighters have no longer shooting the right direction.
We can't get anything if we need a number of national references arranged according to the need and deorganized.
Bianco established by the European absolute monarch or steel with the foot of the foot into the empty nationalistic throat: What a choice for the citizens!
No, we don't want to take the glutins, but a common, full, peaceful, unexpected choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spanish, Portuguese, and we wouldn't even know where to stop the calculation - because the crisis is in Europe.
This is, therefore, the entire Europe, which is attached to the dikte of markets and rating agents that suffer their inability and sustainability of solidarity.
This is, therefore, the whole Europe, which is decreased on the international scene.
We are reduced by the transfer of supervisibility to Europe, but it is the whole Europe that will shortly lose my superstition and each of its nations.
It is necessary to return the draft management of the European Democracy Project.
For only together, the Europeans will be able to reduce their debts, to rescue market governments and to prepare future.
The East of Crisis will present a decision on European level that will not be accepted without a complete democratic legitimity, otherwise it would bring us into the enterprise.
After we had long fighted against this proposal of socialists and Jacques Delorse, all today require the European Economic Government.
Come on.
But think it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such citizens would be a new foolishness and a new blind street.
We must take a new attitude of the European Building.
To take the Republic in France, the Republic must be "boy".
The revolution in interest was not enough to do it.
This lecture is paid.
We have to build Europe, which will be more economically integrated.
This will only be able to make Europe more politically democratic and real European democratic levels.
Let's be Europeans to build Europe.
"Incontact" cards are wide
In optimistic atmosphere, it is opened in a villepinte near Paris, the world-widget of chip carts.
In 2011, Eurosmart should conclude the increase of world selling cart with microprocessor (bankcards, SIM cards) on 11% of more than 6 billion units.
The most weakest is a segment without contact technology that allows you to pay in a lot of property or to solve the purchase by only closer to the reading cards.
This year should be sold throughout the world 460 million chip carts against 320 million sold for year!
Their parts should still be attached (580 million units expected) in 2012 and achieve nearly 10% of the total market with cypcards (6,925 million carts).
After a long time in the APEC countries, Europe is achieved in an uncontact place.
At least 26 million bank cards of Visa has already been built this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are worse: 40,000 non-contaktable Visa carts were delivered.
But the big business strings work for two.
Carrefour gave 2,5 million without contact cart Pass MasterCard this year.
To make a higher speed, the bank needs to save their clients from now.
"The two major French businesses have been able to distribute systematicly in the future to their clients without doctrine bank cards," reports Gérard Nebouy, General Director Visa Europe France.
Banks test the place mobile
But this is the first step to pay the future: mobile phone.
NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needs to implement transactions today only a small number of devices.
"They took the late."
"But to their real divorce should be achieved in the next year."
"For 2012, we sold them for 80 to 120 million units in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President Eurosmart.
But the banks are ready forward.
Bank Crédit Agriculture has reported last night the execution of the test in Caen, which has been carried out from December to June to June of the next year.
The iPhone equipment will be built by the office of an uncontact payment by approximately 200 customers and cooperators.
The BPCE bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Assembly also announced yesterday that he prepared for the offer that allows its clients to pay a mobile phone without doctrine.
The Teroristic Front goes from Sahary to Nigeria
Party's worries between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram section.
Long-term suspects that there are the teroristic group Al-Kayda in Islam Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigeria Section Boko Haram are confirmed.
In the week of the Sunday of Algerian Ministry, Abdelkader Messahel even recognized that Algier had been a "security."
"The treatment of both organizations operating, and the reports of the expert services show that there is a great cooperation among them," explained without further explanation.
It seems that Paris has similar analysis.
The investigation of two Frances in Nigeria in January 2010 could be helped to clarify the participants.
Since the AQMI members were disappeared from one restaurant in Niamey, they should be Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory in the next day killed in the same time as some of their income in operations by special French units.
In Saturdays, French and Nigeria investigators had to find a number of phones with the cycles of terrorists.
Teroristic part
The analysis of the calls carried out to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the Radio France Internationale Stations (RFI), the investigators are interested in more than two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, who lives longer in Maiduuri, a city in the north Nigeria, which is a collib Boko Haram, and the other to the person who says that he's near AQMI and seat.
"It's a progress, but it's likely to wait for more sure evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We already know that the section is happy for the external and intellectual support and shows what is more active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo.
In the last months, this "supported" appears more and more in the development and demonstrations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which separately include human victims or still more complex exhaustive equipment of the same way as the AQMI organization devices are used.
The international community on the chair with Washington has been carried out on Nigeria since that time to take care of the problem that Boko Haram raised.
The Nigeria authorities, in fact, considered a group for the community of light mysticals, was a lot of significant interest.
Quick Success
The Section Boko Haram was based in Maiduuri around the massage, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammeda Yusufa. Boko Haram, which means in Haussa’s language, is the west standard of sin, approved to the Islamic Emirate on the Muslim North Nigeria.
In this poor region there is such a quick connection.
The section is policy and requires a basic maintenance of the Islamic Law Sharia, while its staff fight against the Central Government.
These people are focused on coats, bars and offices first.
In 2009, the staff Boko Haram stays extremely activists and confront their attacks against the police station.
The reaction of the government is usually the same.
The army turns around the city, and the results are 800 dead.
The Master of Mohammed Joseph's section is a challenge and murder in prison.
Since that time, the group radicalizes and leaves its employment on the north.
In 2010, Jos attempts in which 80 people are dead will take another in the main city of Abuja.
In June, it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram's headquarters are on his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local Office of the United Nations will be the first international territory.
The creation of terrorist axes in Africa, which should be carried out from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned with all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Kayda Islamic Maghreb turned to Mali and iger and Somalians from Al-Shabab in Kenya, Boko Haram is shown as new dangers for continent.
Last week in Nigeria on talking with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Jupee said that France is in the state of property and is ready to "provide all information."
World in accordance with the candidates of the President
In the questions about China, Iran, or help of Israel with Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are predicted in unknown and unknown.
Can America be able to handle the world with simple or even comforting thoughts?
When I hear the President candidates, the choices could think about it.
A few days ago Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others repeat the vocational statements and struggles in the area policy, which is traditionally strong of the Republicans.
Sometimes the unsubmitted slogans of China, Iran, or the help of Israel are raised among themselves.
Mitt Romney, the best designable candidate in the respect of the "Grand Old Party" named the authorisation of Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their obligations" because of manipulation with their changes," which is the basic subject in the United States, the migration parts of its migration in Asia.
That's hard if this has to contain the execution of trade wars in itself, he said.
Jon Huntsman, an old Obama's majority in China and the only candidate who had some sophisticated view of the front-line policy, was not at the point that "accepts" emotion.
He required severe, but a constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obamy).
But Huntsman, who's on the last places in the choices, remains unbelievable.
In the image of the President Reagana
Romney also promised the military officers on Iran, if they don't succeed sanks when they stop his nuclear programme.
"I'll be choiced, I'll trust Iran," said the fanfaronic.
"If Obama will be chosen again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Oba that he declared in his responsibilities to this partner.
Officer Herman Cain, the second best with the local candidate, shows an unknown unknown document.
Recently, he called a steadfast position against the Chinese military grave, because Beijing's trying to exit nuclear capacity" - obviously unknown fact that China's own atom's weapons since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to be able to fight against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug carts.
The use of resistance against the proposed terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perrim and another candidate Michele Bachmanno.
Everyone is far away from the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a hard weight in the foreign policy.
The protesters of the current president say that Reagan had also a simple thought and, although he won a stubborn war.
They recognize that Obama himself was a Amateur and that he added water to his wine in things to fight against the terrorism.
They advise the success of his native dialogue with Iran, an unleavened "boys" from Iraq, his statements relating to Libye and thus admitting him a loud range.
But the attack is not easy.
The resident stimulates the national security policy of President Obamy, who removed Ben Ladine, often positively.
From Iraq there is no confidence in the military resources that lead to destruction.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically, so that it may be possible to resume her leader position, the top of Obama on the right place.
North Stream, a new Russian floor in Europe
North Stream's remote plot to Eastern Europe in Russia and leading after the Baltic Sea Day began to work.
He needs to add an equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, Russian plynerian cycle, wanted to fulfill this event.
More than 500 hosts, among them four bodies and governments, recently an inaugurated inauguration of the North Stream, a new floor, which is linked directly to Russia and Germany under the sea.
Similarly German officer Angela Merkel, Russian president Dmitry Medvedav, French Ministry President François Fillon and his Netherlands colleague Mark Rutte joined the control around the twenty-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-e.
This new floor will begin to produce each year to West Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of the Russian floor in the first range of 1 224 km of the region of Petrohrad with the whole country of Mecklemburk-Marin.
The second consumption must be completed at the end of 2012 is allowed to add totally 55 billion cubic meters, which is a quantity equal to the whole French consumption.
And it is already reminded of the possibility to set the third destruction of the floor on the same track.
For Gazprom, this large status of victory is a timely completed.
The protest of the project was strongly protested by Poland and the Popular country.
North Stream, in fact, allows you to add a floor directly to Germany without being led to a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose somewhere on the power: the possibility of pressing Russia's threats to close access to the south-European markets is more difficult for them.
It was most explicitly expressed Varshava when she was not able to compare the North Stream to the "new German-Swiss Package", with calling to the relationship between Hitler and Staline in the Occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it's a political issue of citizens.
The West Europe has obtained its support to this Russian project in it a greater security of its purchases.
However, it is for the price of the price of European energy, since the project created markets between the European East and the West.
Russland has been able to provide its vision of the right link between Russia and the rich western States with high consumption of the floor, which is close to its end.
"This plynood is a folder of our partnership with Russia, a new tendency that organically associates us," confirmed François Fillon at the celebration of the opening of this floor and demonstrated, in which point there are great planner contracts of things as political as economics.
This all explains the wide smiles of the representatives of the Gazprom in the large number of in Lubmin, the leading place of the floor.
The stability of this flow is also a significant technical action.
The submarine consumption is to be protected from the oil of the beton plane to be protected from the coats of the sea ships.
It ends the sea day in a average depth of 200 m.
At his station, it was necessary to remove the mining field from the 2th world war.
"For their security, at least one hundreds have been deleted or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a speaker of the North Stream company.
It was also necessary to increase the measures for the protection of the faun and flowers.
Samoothy destruction is a long cock hair cutting as 242 Effellov, which has never been interrupted in all its length, no ventiles or stains of maintenance.
One control board should be built near Sweden, but the leadership of the project refused it when the Sweden had only wished to see the Russian State company how it was used at their borders.
"In the case of the accident, we'll stop the plane for less than one minute," says Jens Müller.
In the case of the increasing plot contained in the floor, the air is unleavened.
But this case is considered to be a lot of probable, since the answers were proposed so that the increasingness would be one for 100 000 years.
The control of the exploitation of the stage is carried out by the underwater ship, while the inside of the floor is controlled by the devices circled within.
This device shall be carried out in the middle of 1 meters and is pressed by the plot.
For the purposes of all three days of speed 3 m/s, exact information on the events of cow deforming parts shall be provided.
The long-term plot was proposed to work for fifty years without the need to be a smaller right.
Circularization is easierly ensured by pressure.
The value of this button is 200 bars to start and 100 bars in the target.
For the implementation of this project, the forces of five companies were associated.
The leading position remains to Gazprom, which holds 51% part.
The German companies of E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) have been associated with it, as well as the Netherlands company and the French GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called North Stream confirmed and implemented by the flow.
The business has a city in Zoug in Switzerland, where it's very nice.
The Gazprom, afterward, proposed for five years of the Treaty that may be renewed, all its capacity for transport.
"Gazprom will have a total capacity to be a lot of really carried out anywhere," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the flows was assessed by 30% of the operators and 70% of the bank funds.
The total costs of work should be achieved by 7,4 billion euros for both consumption.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs have increased 240 million.
But the minor activists are sure their costs are returned to them, because risks take only Gazprom.
Plynovod goes out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a write border with bovine rivers.
The winds of high 4,5 meters are creating the outside gate.
The sniper measures pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming floor before they are transferred to German flows.
From the last outer terminal, this terminal accepts a million cubic meters of the Russian floor every hour.
When you get full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Tag recorder
The Italian company of Moleskine, which was based for fifty years ago, wants to offer a joy of writing again.
He brings the boat of goodness, the hours of the light of the light.
The writer Moleskine is easily recognised by his black dress and his lists of white white colors as well as with the time.
Because the writer Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian business Mode Mode of Sitting in Milan will be decided to introduce a new design, but separated recorder on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultor working for the business, is mentioned by a new product.
The writer is inspired by an old manufacturer technology "moleskin" (mitace cup), which is used for editing the top of the lake.
This type of writer was very priced by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to an old and forgotten target, which was the icon of pre-guard artists until the XX century," says Mary Sebregondi, which has become a leader of persons in the Mode Mode.
Success is here.
In the middle of 2006 and 2010, sell 26% for the last year to set up 12,7 million coins.
The situation is a remote production from the first year when only 3000 writers were prepared.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set a nice portrait to buy, for the writer is to take an advice as a student or professional.
The image of the writer Moleskine is that his owners are people of space, cultural, and open spirit.
A small Italian company who had 12 employees at their beginnings, which has at least one hundred and since 2008, has two officers, one in Milan and the other in New York.
His writers sent to the book and through the FNAC trade string to small buckets in the middle of the cities where he could provide his identity.
"We have seen the spirit of time and this need of a new write, through a huge e-mail development," explains Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural signature brings the development of the Moleskine writer: the recent tag opened the "Income", where Architects or artists make their writer.
In August, on the opportunity of the film festival in Locarn, a new recorder recorder also made a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this culture orth and diversifies its products: balls, diary, tickets, notebooks ... Mark is expanded in a total number of pools.
Success that has built the consent: In 2006, a company Mode to buy SG Capital Europe's investment funds, today Syntegra Capital, a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is that high part of unemployed employees?
At least 19% of the inspectioned persons are looking for work.
Today, 15 weeks are opened for employment.
In 2005, the volunteer public policy has been carried out in the percentage of non-employed persons are two times higher than average, including 19% to 9% for the population.
Is that smelling?
"No, Eric Blanchet, the General Director of Association Adapt, who organizes the Tiden for the employment of the emphasis."
"From 15 years are careful."
"In that time there was no percent of unemployed two times, but three times higher."
"But it's still a lot of things to do."
It is necessary to say that for unemployed individuals, they survive reading transactions before their training to work.
One of the older persons: 37% has more than 50 years (17% in average).
They have low quality: 80% does not have maturity and 2,3 million high school students are only 10 000 individuals.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widely expanded: 53% in the absence of 38% in average.
The criteria that are particularly complicated to the return to the employment and that represents the "directory of the problem", says Christian Grapin, the General Director of Tremplin Association Association, based on 1992, to help the companies to accept an indicated employees.
That's so much if it's about the objective.
It remains unpredicted, the ways of thoughts that are sure it comes, but too late.
The study conducted in April of the IMS-Entreprendre for la City discovered that the managers have a loud level of knowledge of individuals" s "seemed to the persons on the past cross and psychic or psychic losses."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achievement of the objectives to employ 6% of the employees established in the law of 1987.
The last known numbers from 2008 are equal to 2.6%.
"Now we are moved about 3%," says Peter Blanc, the General Director of the Agefiph organization, confirmed by the election of commitments that do not follow this law.
It is also the number of "committed" businesses, as well as the payment of the payments that have been paid between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 of ECUs (a 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, who increased the articles, created a strong pressure on business, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real understanding, especially in large businesses."
Only 59% of the employees from 20 to 49 employees are employed by 82% of the employees from 100 to 199.
Hazard: "How luck."
Before in the outer evening (20h45), the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were not covered the happiness that would bring them this friendly excuse.
We're not going so far to write that the collection between them, but the image is symbolic.
They sit near at the office of Stade de France at a short time, and Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were avoided.
Five months after his wrestling gesture in the front of Turkey, the Belgian trainer gave his player only praises.
"I am with Eden and his progress is very satisfied, and I am actually loved his land."
"I want to move forward," ensures the French Lille player.
"If it's a difference between his execution in clubs and national humanity's challenges," it is one and the same, it is justified."
"I'm a whole year in Lille, that's not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clean my tag."
Hazard, a quarter against Romania on Friday night because of this warrant against France, comes to the station in St. Denis to finally shut up."
So you can't forget "happiness".
Play against Bleus, which has built up from 7 years and in their winning taxes in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been fancy," she says.
This is needed to add more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More about that, because against Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), he remembers.
"We've been crucified immediately."
"I can play against them, it's just happy!"
Good-order Leekens reminded the "hearted".
"Hardost" to shoot the "Shearted" feast.
"Hrdost" is also in the quality of the "suds" that France has been more than a year after the trauma in the South African City of Knysna again became a very high level."
"Laurent Blanc made a great job," he divorced.
It is necessary that Belgium will be mistaken on the next mystery of Europe, the technical photobacter would like to see in 2014 in the aeroplane with France's direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will be great," he understood.
"We just build something, players are ambitious, they have a healthy hungry."
"You'll know that for the next challenges," including this against France.
Portuguese very self-secured
The Portuguese bucket Paul Bento has a great optimism barga against Bosnia (22:00) this centre in Lisbon.
In the way, the two teams were wrong with realism.
"In the end of those 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paul Bento is seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese photobal representation in which the carmid is since 2010, is qualified on Euro 2012.
Portuguese shares from happiness in the fact of 90 minutes.
He's staying with one shot and one supply, Bosna.
When you know the five results (0-0) in the Bosnian Health, it seems to be clear that nothing has been exposed.
Portuguese had had more than a hour of survey, but it was not able to give a so-called hair that would like him.
"It's a good result that doesn't contain a risk in himself because we didn't have a lot outside."
But home on their wonderful Stade de la Luz in Lisbon are the Portuguese convinced that they should be able to build in the public, even though the ball is decisively like "excellent," says the optimist, but would be considering Bento.
"We're waiting for a very equipped challenge, but we're very sure that we can have the top," reported a Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50% chances to be on Euro 2012," the follower Carlose Queiros related.
The unresolved passenger in Bosnia would allow Portuguese to give hair and gather.
The unresolute pack can suffer Bosnians who also need to give a hair.
"It's a good result that doesn't contain a risk in himself because we didn't have a goal outside," says Bento.
"We'll play against the team that has a great technical quality and which has players with great individual qualities," added.
As in the Senice, the Portuguese will be interested on the Bosnia team immediately from the beginning of the maximum press so that they don't have time to think."
Good thought, under the condition that this time it will be realistic.
