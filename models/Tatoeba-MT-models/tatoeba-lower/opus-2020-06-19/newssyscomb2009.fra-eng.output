Triomphe of the right people in Austria, they have 29 per cent total
According to the preliminary results, the parliamentary elections in Austria have made a sensitive advantage of the two parties forming the current large coalition and a notable strength of the population parties.
The Australian Popular Party (PEVP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Moltrer is seriously threatened, suffers particularly important losses.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepared a triomphal return on the political scene at national level.
According to the preliminary results, socialists (SPE) remain, with 29,8% of votes, the first political force of the country, however, compared with the elections of 2006, lost 5,5% of the votes.
The OVP, which, with 25.6% loss nearly nine percent of voices, has yet done worse.
It is the worst results of the two large parts of the next guarantee; in particular for the population party, which declared the anticipated elections, the result is literally catastrophical.
Once July, when the OVP left coalition, the population party had a significant progress on the SPE.
However, the electors were immediately punished them to have left the Government to escape.
Since the first reactions faced to the results, specifications on the possible demission of the head of the Partie and the current vice-chanclier Wilhelm Moltrer were pronounced.
The observators believe that this could happen since lunch during the extraordinary advice of the Partie's direction.
Such evolution would facilitate the way to the result of the result of the election that remains the most probable, to know the renewing of the great SPE and OVP coalition.
However, seeing the strengthening of the two right population parties - free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18% and BZÖ 11% of the voice - socialists expressed the fear of a recurrence in 1999 when the population party was agreed with the peoples (in the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it is that the BZÖ was separated in 2005) on a common government, which also raised the sanctions of the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any part and that he would prevent the return to Vienna on the national political scene.
The last part of having access to the Green Parliament, but these are easily lost and returned, among the Australian political parties, of the third to the fifth position.
Of course, no other parties have broken the limit of four percent and are not accessed to the Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are risked to refresh
If there was no problem on the chess investigators accused in India, illegal cafards accused, it would follow, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Chess Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refreshment of the Indian Czech Relations.
The Ministry declares him today in New York after he met his Indian homologic Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem wasn't regulated, then, yes, a certain refreshment would happen," stated it after the meeting, after a checical initiative.
Mukherjee said, by exiting parliaments, the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, it mentioned that in the case of Peter Svácha, which was deleted from the accusation and punishment of an amendment, the Central Government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling's case, which was placed under the jurisdiction of this.
"It may be a problem," said the Ministry.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučara, condemned at three years of prison, would be called to a higher instance.
Then, he could ask freedom in caution and wait for the judgment in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner is expressed in the same sense also during the parliamentary.
"The counsel is to call a Supreme Court, after which it may be grateful," said the Chec diplomacy captain.
The only way that the Czech Party can intervene in this case is to provide the condemned "a competent legal support", indicates the Indian Ministry.
He also said that such aid was already brought to them from India.
"We want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition continued for many years.
The Indians also recognize him," indicates Schwarzenberg.
In the same time, as he said to the CTK, he submitted to his partner that the Czech Republic had a lot of importance to the problem occurred in the chechical entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of those technical researchers as a great pregnancy," said he.
The Ministry asked whether he had received the promise to take care of the business from India.
"I have already received a lot of promises," he only said.
A Czech makes the fight for the sea background
It is close to a mural electronic card, which is represented by Australia and the adjacent sea zones.
But it doesn't interest in the continent, but a little lost point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is in Australia, as well as the sea's ground is adjacent.
This area is, however, great as its own continent," says the Italian jurisdiction Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the trend members of the United Nations Division for Ocean and Sea law.
His chief, the Director of the Division, the Chec Justice Vaclav Mikulka follows the presentation and the full time to others.
The time for work and entusiasm characterizes the regulatory atmosphere.
The sea background hides a little known world until now, rich in natural resources.
There can be found from petrole, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for now unknown, which can contain the key for the development of a medicine against the cancer.
A larger background than the earth shuts
The literal States have started our days to aspire with veterinary at the new submarine territory.
According to the United Nations Convention, they serve their rights, on which they agreed in Montgo Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is especially from the area of which it is called the continental shelf, which often belongs to several hundreds of kilometres from the coast of the country given.
This age can, according to the Convention, provide exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"For simplifying, it is considered as continental shelf the part of the sea fund and its sub-sol, which constitutes a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
It is exceedingly exceeding the borders of the literary sea, often beyond two hundreds of thousands of marins who represent exclusive economy ladite," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country presents the Commission for the establishment of external borders of the continental shelf should be supported by a large scientific and technical documentation based on cost prospects and metry.
It is the result of several years of preparation work.
"The one of our roles is to address the Commission of a legal and scientific assistance.
The Commission has taken five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For this time, the success was only known for the last three countries mentioned," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly wide its submarine possessions, has recently known a global resistance.
The New Zealand, also win from the territory - the extension of the marine fund, which has assigned to the Commission last week, corresponds to 1,6 million square miles, which represents the extension of the multiple country by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit that they will take in the future of the exploitation of the marine fund will be, as they project it, inestimable.
Progressively, other countries will present their requests.
They can do it in a decade of 10 years after ratifying the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental shelf ends, starts the area of the season, proclaimed by the convention "Common Patrimon of Humanity".
There is no other State plays exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is assigned by an international institution established by the Convention.
"Now, we don't throw up there, the marine background is not a Klondike," said the director Mikulka, exaggering that "thes areas are clearly defined and their regimes are attached to a contract."
Czech Republic of the Pacific
A part of the marine fund is today also in the Czech Republic.
She shares it with other States of the ex-bloc of the East countries in the framework of the Common Interoceanmetal Organization.
This has received in 1991, in accordance with the Convention, as well as investors of some other States, the state of the one called "a pioneer investors".
She has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawai Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investors leads to the surface of the ex-Tchecoslovaquia.
The fund is moved, it's a type of submarine reply from Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an extension with a total surface of 75,000 square miles.
The area represents a rich gishing in polymetallical concretions containing nickle, cuivre, cobalt and manneese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurisdiction.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonia employer of the Division, brings an example of such concretion.
She remembers a little ground pump, or well, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, who, according to the league, animated the Golem.
German special forces were located for the freedom of otages
The Government of Egypt was concerned with the assistance of Germany for the resolution of the crisis of otages - experts have come.
When the situation has become serious, special units were prepared, but they have never passed in action.
Moreover, on the circumstances of the liberation of the eleven European tourists taken in Egypt is revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated directly in the safeguard operation.
Thus, as specialists of the Federal Army, as well as Officers of the GSG 9, the aircraft of the federal police and the federal police office of criminals, as well as experts in logism of the Technical Hilfwerk were in the place of liberation.
Thus, the port-word of the Ministry on Monday's communicating, German forces have not finally been required, the officers who have delivered their prisoners and have been when they recognized the immense freedom by force.
The Government of Egypt would accept the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on support force.
"It's not happy until there," said a port-word of the Ministry of the Federal Interior.
The aggressors took the group of German tourists in the south of Egypt, five Italians, a Roman, and their eight Egyptian partners.
After their department in the wilderness to the south of Egypt, the otages were transmitted into the border area between Egypt, Lybia, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the tax collectors is permanent until now vague, as well as the details of liberation or possible payments.
Those who have been saved have been healthy and saved in the Cair.
Steinmeier stated that the released offences were under the protection of the embassy of Germany.
He didn't tell anything about the details of the liberation.
In Berlin for the time, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the "Image" magazine, the five vacances and special forces should have cut off on a Airbus of air army and arrive in Germany March.
The room of representatives of the United States refuses the safeguard plan
The first room of the United States Congress has cut off the plan of saving financial markets in several 700 billion dollars.
The Dow Jones smelled in the bush.
With 227 voices against 206, the room of representatives of the United States rejected the safeguard plan for the Government's financial markets.
Although all the calls of the President of the United States George W. Bush and political men at the head of the two parties, the programme that should jump the financial market has not obtained the majority.
In a dramatic manufacturer, the participants tried unexpectedly to convince the opposers of the good based on this large plan of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, called the deputy to a favorable vote that the plan would be immunity.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the evitation of something that has not yet happened," he agreed.
During the vote, Down Jones was lower than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the statistical safeguard plan could be capable.
He reached a little time before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the failure, to stop again.
Experts now project new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme may enter into force, approval and room of the deputy and senate.
Organisators sign a growing number of reservations
This should be a good hiver for German travel agencies:
In relation to the reserves for the next months according to a study, the case number has well increased in comparison with the previous year - for the hiver saison, even more than 30%.
Despite low conjunctional perspectives, German travel safe remains insufficient according to this study.
In regard to the reservations for the hiver saison, the travel agencies have recorded a number of businesses more than 31 per cent in the same period, as it trusted in Berlin the German Federation of Voyage Agencies (DRV).
According to the Research Institute of Markets GfK, growing numbers of reserve already dominates the months of southern.
So the number of venders would have cut up about 11% in comparison with 2007, trusted the DDRV.
The sources of these results are the numbers of the GFK, which analyse monthly the data of reserves of 1200 travel agencies and which makes estimates for the global market.
The reserves of traveling from the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Because of the low dollar course, the travels to the United States would be particularly requested, the DDRV declared.
There, the increase of reservations would be exceeding a Third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our content would be particularly searched by Germans.
The travels organized particularly are very requested, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of higher energy prices and food products, the costs would be here "plasy calculated for the client than for a individually organised journey."
Consumers can economic money among others with the reductions of anticipated reserves or offers All Inclusive, explained Laepple.
The months of earlier have also been maintained as well as the increase of the sell numbers will be recorded again in relation to the last year - even according to another study, the number of Germans who have entered a travel was lowed in comparison with the previous year.
My first time at the Beir's feast
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits continuously, of beer in letters and festibrities in tiroline costs to design.
An event at the bird's party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we actually don't have a big-chose in common.
She's blonde, TV animator and takes a tirolian cost on measure.
I've got the hairs, I'm a student, and my clothes are a chance.
But one thing happens to us: at least three minutes at the bird's party, and the photographs are already thrown up on us and fill their memory card - very flatcard, and this is my first visit to the bird's party.
That's how we're doing friends.
The good market costs of Tyrolian seems to be achieved by its objective.
As a tourist of the bird's feast and normally inhabited at the north of the Whitewurst equator, my feeling to be well in the traditional cost was until now limited.
But once on the Teresa place, it's half more worse.
Everyone or almost takes a tirolian costume or pantalons in cows; nobody has a smoke or hate - it is completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolian costume collects a few stranger eyes at the state of bananes-choko.
A bavarois makes me note that I would have attached my table: "Left means free, in the middle of the wedding, on the right side, on the back of the widow."
It's clearly, I'm thrown up my bottom from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and rigole.
Others do not make so bad for these technical substiles of flirt and bring simple fuel, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and we expose their back-train nu without being invited.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is Bob, comes from England and comes for the first to the bird's feast.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long ooooo.
He tells me all of this after he's getting out of the shoe that he was drinking before.
Directly close to this fire mouth that everyone thinks to be a pool.
So Bob is one of these "swee-swee-swee-swee-swee-swee.
Others do not have the opportunity to get out of the alcohol in this way.
At eight hours of the evening, safeguards have fallen on the place of the feast and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The diseases interfere in the same time - always by four, they travel their covered cities of tenders.
This works so for most visitors of the beast's party: we're going empty, we'll be full.
Those in the circle of the bowls under the board are not visible.
"It's those who can't be able to do anything more," I cried one of the safeguards in answer to my question, and it's lost in the middle.
Acident victime identified by the police
A pioneer of 63 years, deceived in the hospital after a vehicle was heavy, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the event of Friday after midnight, in the city, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but afterwards.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he suffered dangerous conduct.
He was left from, under care.
Turkey extends its diplomatic horizons.
Even before Turkey thought to join the European Union, the European powers had a short time to penetrate in its territory.
On the coast is from Bosfor, at 20 notes, in Asia, there is one of the most ends of its imperial ambition.
The garden of Hydarpasha was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
This is at least what we tell the guidances.
The monument is prepared for horse based on platforms, torch torch to each of his angles, such as some German provincial maries.
The stones are sad.
The whole building is ruined.
But once within the voluntary billerarian, we have no doubt about the largest of the company, which represents a passenger to the west.
The gare was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard to the Imperialisme game, wanted to fulfil its medieval domination ambitions by the way of ferry comes to Damascus, Bagdad and the most known earth under the name of Saoudite Arabia.
However, the German imperial ambitions were funded during the First World War.
His ferry paths were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab unregulars.
The isolation related to its region to the areas, generated by the glass borders of the Froid War, is completed.
. The British and the forces of the Empire proceeded outside the Egyptian and put the Turkeys and their German associates outside Palestinian and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha's garage.
In 1917, an explosive train explosive train destroying his subtile tooth .
Turkish sources say that it's a sabotage.
Afterward, she falls lately in ruin, disturbing in the managers of the story.
But today, the ferroviary transition to Anatolia and all the east points, serves at least symbolicly, to subline the width of Turkey diplomatic horizons.
The Partie of Justice and Development for the power, the ACP, has established a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolation of its region to the areas, generated by the green borders of the Froide War
Now it's the time of a new income policy.
The Turkish Government has marvelous relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hammas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was attached to a wagon bed directly from Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turc Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in the foreign policy.
The next morning, after a traveling 10 hours and half, seeked on bruying railways, which the pad was reminded of the old world of the celebrated documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital, as a new city of a new secular state, turning the dose to his past German.
But the AKP with its well known islamist races represents an example of change of Turkish consensus.
He suffers the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi attached me to the general AKP quarter, a more modern structure, explicitly built in stones and acids, in a development quarter, held by a half-building trade centres and by many passengers in which the middle managers in coast-cravate men and women met for morning businesses.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a right centre policy of any other party in Europe.
Costume, cravate, and he's even a Black Berry.
" the objective of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey in its immediate neighbourhood.
The frid War was an anomalia" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from his back country.
Now she must look at the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one and another.
She had to do both.
"But, that's a moment, "I asked if" Turkey wouldn't have to choose?"
"Turkey" said, "I don't want to choose between both."
Then he subscribed a view that almost all of those with whom I could talk, they rejected me by heart: The Turkish ferry path is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasa, and around the Black Sea, so it is, so much for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a metaphorical European traveling on the roads to Asia and the Middle East.
Returning to Hydarpasha, after another night without sleep, I repeated to these two Germans, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who followed the construction of this building there is 100 people.
They would well be surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in most part, be found in Turkey's hands.
While I waited at the terminal, the ferry to travel Bosfor, I remembered the period when Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could imagine this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley's memory, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical Director of Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (decided on September 11) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Having already departed from his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The heart should include less than 21ans, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years refused to leave the heart.
The name "Proteus" (which changed forms according to mythology) represented the will and the ability of heart to handle any type of music was presented to him, that it was madrigal or Messiah.
The musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, and that was thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remains constantly in the years.
Remember how all of us were repeated to "lay the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all here in music.
So sing!"
His baguete technology was absolutely clear, precise, even if it's never dictatorial or appearing.
Something is the musical standard, he highered it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver should be called a cheese, it's Vernon Handley.
I well knew him during the decades of 1962 to 1982, when he led Guildford Philharmonic.
These 40 years ago, I have received more than one hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that no one of them has ever discovered me and, sometimes, they even inspired me.
Todd Handley had so weird this combination of large and personal modesy.
He hated the drivers who, according to him, "not focus only on some people."
He'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (determined on September 25) states that "in 1946 he had reached his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became in 1950, a member of Houble-Norma research, while he made a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is the letter of Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953, he was a teacher in economic history in Nottingham University, and at the same time ended a phenomenon on the British Plastic Industries, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the British Rubber Industrie.
In the 50 and 51 years in the United States, he studied in the Norman Houble, and the 1952, at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for the Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to discipline this part of his past remains unknown.

"I recommend the exposition of Joseph Vicente Resino " Flamenco and Life " because its photographies in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They took me attention to the fact of their simplyness and strength that they transmit and because they always treated protagonists with a lot of respect.
A exposition that transmits a lot of feelings.

Second assault for Honda's super ventures
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his pre-presentative had already been a good apartment, this new monovolume has a more larger space.
This is added to a few raffined mechanics, which increase the consolidation of conduct and allow more essential.
A revolution faced to a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line in the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
There is an innovator design, a new platform, greater dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it is necessary to submit that this new Honda Jazz has come six years after the market of the first generation.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a venture phenomenon on other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialised car in 2002 and 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz was sold since his launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than one million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase its money in Europe.
Thus, since Japan's mark in 2007 was marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2009, she thinks to sell 100,000, which would represent a growth of 17 % in the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6,7% of Honda's ventures in Spain.
The responsables of the Spanish office hoped to sell 2,000 Jazz a year.
This is exactly the outcome of the new Jazz that allows Honda to pill in a large part the bottom of sales in Spain.
In fact, the officials of the mark hoped to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars were to say 4,000 cars unless in 2007, or a 16 % of sales.
In the meaning of this price of venture, Honda increased its market part in Spain, achieved a part of 1,8%, reported to 1,6% last year.
The Japanese mark also hopes to obtain a part of 2 % market in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market part when the new model will go out.
It's about Insight, a hybrid to five gates and a large compact - 4,37 metres long - on which the Nipon company hopes to trade about about 200,000 cars per year in the whole world.
In accordance with markets and estimations of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the Insight's venture will be made to the United States, while the other half remaining will be divided between the Old Content and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is provided during the first three months of the next year after its presentation to the public on January in Valence.
In relation to the first generation, the new Jazz increased its dimensions.
His length has 3,90 meters (5 centimeters in more), its width 1,69 meters (two centimeters in more), and the distance between its assess is 2.50 meters that represents a increase of five centimeters.
However, the height does not change 1,52 meters.
The sizes increase and the internal space also.
This wine is, on one hand, in the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, in the introduction of an essential reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the coffee - which has a double fund system – can contain to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in more relation to the coffee of the first generation.
It is necessary to indicate that these sizes are the versions of a motor 1.4L, because the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liter.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as the back fire or the panoramic tooth - is the improvement of access to the behind places.
The gates that are accessed to the ground seats have an angle of opening 80 degrees, part of the back doors of the first Jazz, which were working with a angle of 67 degrees.
Motors are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped from two propulsors of essence of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
The two engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces the consumption of essence and CO2 emission, which makes the most powerful engine and increases the engine regime.
First engine 1,2 liters develop a power of 90 horses to 6000 tr/min and 114 Nm of couple to 4.900 t/min.
This propulsor - which was on the previous Jazz 78 horses - presents an essence consumption of 5,3 miles to 100 km and 125 grams of CO2.
In relation to the previous propulsor, who had 83 horses on the previous generation, now achieved 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5,4 litres to 100 km and CO2 emissions.
'Abble Voiture' which disappears collisions
In order to progress the development of the technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has inspired this time, of nature, particularly the beauty.
The Japanese business has created a robot who, following the flight of the babies, disappears the accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps to collection prevention technology.
Ingegners of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. Confected this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science Search and Advanced Technology of the Prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Search and Markets Management, the BR23C represents Nissan Security Boulder.
This robot will allow vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each beauty created its own personal space of an oil form that seems a lot of like Nissan Security Boulder.
But the most important is the eye of the ball, which can see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows him to fly without interruption within his own personal space.
To re-crease this visual function, the engineers have set the point of what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are on a distance of two metres and in a range of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to abuse the obstacle.
"In the moment he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a beauty and immediately changes direction by bifurcing its 90 degrees or more roads to disappear collision.
The greatest differences in relation to any other existing system is that evacuation manufacturer is totally instinctive.
If this was the case, the robot would not be able to react enough quickly to lose the obstacles, "Explain Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Movement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
In contrast to a beauty, the robot cannot be turned to the top or bottom, nor in diagonal; it can only be moved in two dimensions and, according to what its routes allow him and not in infinite directions such as the babies.
For this motive, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can disappear the obstacles.
" Each second of this device is only to treat information and to act according to these data.
You don't need to keep information or intuitive logic of preliminary manufacturers, so it can continue with only a few of the bills of memory.
This can be surprised, but we don't talk about giga-bytes of memory, nor even mosque-bytes."
This represents the first cause of development of new instant prevention technology, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in a decade of years after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer battery, which are less and are more than lithium-ions.
The other possible application of this technology to the future may be the adaptation of this device on a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by disappearing obstacles on the road.
They were afraid of being hypothesis.
It is necessary to recognize that the United States Treaty, in addition to the fact that he had a lot of liquid to make plans, isn't destructed by genes.
Faced the crisis, and to abuse that the Americans are in the hypothecs to the solvent banks, they have created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel '.
It's going to say the 'Hotel of bad credits'... or story.
The luxury aspect of this apartment and especially the Master of Hotel brings us to think of many times if it's the good time to ask a preparation.
And, especially, where to do it.
It's sure this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved to the boys.
What if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears within the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital in MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the income to his tower of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japan's bank, which will build nine billion dollars to take 21% of his capital, a new accumulation by a strong downside of his course in Bourse.
One week after a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9,9% of normal Morgan Stanley's standard actions to $25,25 or a total number of $3,000.
The retained price is less than 19% than the accountable value of the titles at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of conversionable tickets by guarantee him a 10% reward and assorts a conversion price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a average price of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current course.
However, Morgan Stanley's action lost 6,79% to 23,07 dollars to 1700 GMT.
"This strategic allocation is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the bank holding state," explained John Mack, Director General of the United States.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which has to allow him to diversify its activities but makes it over under the Federal Reserve Authority.
His relationship with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis confronts the greatest names of Wall Street to adopt a very careful attitude than before.
Moreover, the provisions present show that the Agreement was amended during the last day: Morgan was just announced that he would sold to 20% of its actions to Japan for about 8,5 billion dollars.
"It has been a week ago, explained Tokyo Toshide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, "we think that the participation would be completely composed of regular actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover us."
On the basis of the summary average price, MUFG will pay its offices Morgan Stanley 7% below their account value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20% of the benefits by action.
The Agreement proposes that MUFG can be converted in a year half of its preferences in regular actions if these recent changes are more than 50% above the conversion price, or at about 47 dollars during a date period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG captains will allow him to introduce investment opportunities, strengthen his budget and increase its liquidity.
However, a port of the group refused to give specifications on the strategic projects of the two new alias.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show a life-one solution ratio about about 15%, one of the best sectors.
Morgan decided to have "because" to go to his budget since the end of August.
The last weeks have been tested for the group, which has seen its course of Bourse in half, while the cost of assurement against a failure risk on its debt.
This cost flowed lunch but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survive" banks of Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's racket, announced that they had $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.

They're at the Caire.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captivity for ten days in the wilderness have been returned this morning after midnight, healthy and safe in the Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released by a Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, the ships arrived at 15.30 hours from a special airport on the Al-Maza military basis, acquired at the International Airport of Caire.
They were immediately transferred, unable to talk to the press, on the side of helicopters to the hospital of Maadi, a resident bathroom in Caire, to achieve examinations.

Letters - The silent majority of culture
A discussion on the financing of the culture makes manchets and buys this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise to declare the mistakes that are given to small museums, archives, archeological footballs or national historical places that feel hungry?
What politicians will remember the federal government that he deny his monuments and his patriotic buildings?
What about Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually keep our patrimunity?
Do you know that the French government consists of three million and half euros in the restauration of the only Chamber of China in the Valley of Loire?
In our neighbors of America, it is written in the Constitution of their countries that the protection of the patrimoine is part of the culture of the Americans and that this patrimoine must be protected by all citizens, elections and all government departments, and that is, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Quebec history companys, at least 40 000 beneficiaries grouped in 211 history companys, patrimoine, archives and genologories are concerned to preserve the history, keep with three under private monkeys and keep archeological clothes.
These are, often, who are the dogs of our patrimoine, who protest with the energy of the despair when promotors and decisions launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cimeters.
When, a court for history and patrimoine?
The Governments of Benelux nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The states of Benelux are in support to the Belgium-Helding Bank, as the first European bank establishment in the situation of depression after the effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, in part of nationalism, and the three countries support a total of 11,2 billion euros, this financial institution and assessment also have interests in Hungary.
This weekend, Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands governments have agreed at the highest level in this case, also calling to the European Central Bank and to the responsibility of the competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis increases a year more than one, is for the Fortis bank. In a certain point, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve forward.
In accordance with the decision adopted in the Sunday night, the three states will be raised near the half (in the height of 49%) of the bank capital in each country.
The bank will, without doubt, sell a part of its participations, among which, in the first place, activities, essentially ensure that she has buyed the last year of the Hollandian ABN Amro.
The last week, Fortis actions started a vertiginous challenge. In the second half of the week, serious crisis signs have already been discovered in the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to the failure.
Nothing of venture, the actions of the society have broken 12 per cent, to achieve its lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, the actions were broken over two thirds of their value.
With regard to the current value of the actions, the total value of the capital of the group turns around 14 billion euros, which, according to the leaders of the society, is not realistic.
The direction of the society accuses the incertitude of the Australian Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the American Safety Plan of 700 billion dollars, from the origin of Fortis Actions.
Monday, the papers have already benefited from a lower increase.
Vendredi, Philip Dierckx was named at the head of the bank, as a new general director.
Financial organization also looked for private accusers, but has not yet received proposal on the fund.
Before, the Belgian government announced that the investors should not be able to do so, they would not lose their money.
No panic has been resented in the bank client circle and no agency has been taken.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also recovered leasing companys.
A round in the pool
In America, live and health security companys often refused to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, on the basis of information on its medicines acquiring.
Experts in the protection of information are afraid that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
" There are data protection programmes relating to the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, in the agreement of the concerned person.
This kind of program must be found among independent hands, otherwise it will be reassured to trust his pool in a renard" - Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage medical prescriptions, in Washington Post.
Insurance companys depend on the price of ensure and capital ensure in case of suffering, from the health of the customer who is present, and if they consider that risk is too large, they don't even assure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they signed no ensure agreement with them only after having taken knowledge of the results.
Despite ten years, Dick found a process very lowerly: from a identification number, it is easily provided to the pharmacies, the data on the achievements of the person in the eight months. From this, the program determines himself, of what disease it suffers and what is its health.
For example, if this person usually buys strong doses of cholesterol reductor, it refers to a extremely high level of grass in the blood, which puts it in a higher risk category.
More versions of this programme are circulation. Some determine a risk coefficient at the same time, so there is no greater thing to do to the assureer part of the papers. However, small problems can still appear.
In the absences of this programme, a medicine may be used to various purposes. For example, some measures may be used against migraine or against challenges, but may also be effective against depression.
This last is considered by the ensure as a agricultural risk factor, while others, not.
Companies have been developed in the research and analysis of data. They must request patient authorisation before collecting information necessary at the pharmacies.
The authorities have been punished, even if they have not been sanctified for their missing by the past.
Some company also treat the results of laboratory analysis, and relates to the data on the consumption of medicine. In this way, they are able to provide a more precise portray than the health state of patients.
Moreover, more society have access to data, and the use control becomes parallel and more difficult.
There is a distinct law on the protection of medical data, but its action field is not only for practices and security.
A law proposal on the extension of the control circulation of the authorities on the specialized undertakings in the data provider is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that it is not enough and therefore he has developed further before his programme, which would prevent the transfer of data to the exclusive agreement of the concerned person.
It is another question to know whether the concerned person is really free to give its agreement or not, because if it refuses, the ensure does not sign an ensure contract with it.
So and at the end of the account, the bullets depend on the welcome of the rent.
The Marseille Global Menu
The European Union and India multiply their trade changes by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners one for the other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this nineth summary near the other problems, in large part of the global.
Today, there will also be a France-Inde summary in which it will be particularly a question of cooperation in atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power to which it should give a larger word right in international business, but the Member States have not yet agreed about their support in New Delhi for its candidate as a member of the United Nations Security Council.
They are not too attached to this question yesterday to this 9th summary organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Chief of the Diplomation, Javier Solana, took the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with which they were agreed that in five years, they were going to multiply with two trade scrambles, which means a highest of a hundred million euros.
As regards that between 2000 and 2007, the transition of markets has passed from 25 billion to 55 billion, it does not seem to be an ambitiative objective.
In this meaning, they have harmonised 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flows, and the aircrafts will also take their shoes in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union at the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The objective is to equalize the situation with one side, India who is the first trade partner of the EU and the other, New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among the EU partners.
The summary made its attention to global affairs.
The African and Pakistan situation were strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and it was urgent to have a United Nations conference on this issue.
The end of Doha's trade cycle was also concerned, although both had a large part in the current case.
The EU confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, especially that it would like to reduce at least 20 per cent of its toxic materials until 2020.
India was also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that it should pass a global market during the conference on the next year, and reduce the emission of gas effects of fifty per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent the price of food goods, and support the convocation of an international work meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The chief of the Indian State is now in the French capital, where it is prepared to sign a agreement on the peaceful use of the atomic energy.
In Paris, we hope that French society will receive commands for a value of 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian Atomic Reactors.
According to the information of the pressing agency, the Agreement would take over 15 years.

He found Steve Fossett's airport, the billion officer lost a year ago.
The airport of Steve Fosset, the billioner lost on September 3, 2007, while he flyed on the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
The debris were found on a plate at 3000 meters of height, in the area of Sierra Nevada of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
In the airline, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, announced the doubts that remain: "The aircraft has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is well about the one on whom Steve Fosset traveled on the day he lost," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human residence has been found, nor on the airport, nor in the aircraft.
In February, the 63-year billion was considered as deceited .
The U.S. Transport Security Office (Ntsb) made known that a few hours after the repeating of the equipment, a research team sent on the sites, identified the device: it is well from Bellanca 8kcab, lost on 3 September 2007, when Fosset decolla from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal effects of Fosset have been found by a couple to their room in Mammoth Lakes.
This is two documents that have the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of the Illinois, of the species and a pull.
Fossett research has been interrupted a month after his loss.
The billioner was won a place in the history through a long series of records.
In the sixth trial, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the tour of the world on a aircraft ballon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he turned the world in the air and without scale.
In all these records, also the guy who had been driving at 15,445 meters of height, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A 4x4 outside the common of a original and well defined design, marked lines, surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of "compacts" of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Justiced by its contents out of standards, unexpected and non-conventional contents will be the communication that will comply with the launch of 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
So the publicitarian batteries that will comply with the beginning of the new car will be located in an inevitable mode of communication through a future campaign of showing in 3D, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the mileshopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and through special balls distributed to Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in nearly real dimension and tridimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the print that looking at the image, the auto out of the display.
Then, through the use of innovative technology remove8, the new Glk will be lighted according to the spots, in all its details, and then recommended in a single image.
It is clear that with this publicity Mercedes, Mercedes trys to introduce something again in the stereotype area of automobile communication.
Will she succeed with this formula to exceed the interest of the future? We will see it well.
Here are the Italian Hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Despo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italia has hate now? They're part of the group "Ultras Italia" who follows the Italian national team since years, and who, until now, has never created big problems.
He never had been worried with adversary tifosies.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promotors come from Triveneto.
From Verrone, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (really) of Campania and Pouilles were added.
They had tricolored drapes on which they appeared in their original city: Wednesday, they were all removed to not be identified.
They're inspired from the English tifoseries.
In Bulgaria, they found a real nazist tiphoserary, the Levski.
The Figc had placed Italian tiphosis, 144 bills for the party: all nominatives, and so easily controlable.
And the Viminal had actually controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one in the course, no one had been prohibited to fresh a stage.
Four Italian tiphosis who had ancients of stade crime, did not have the right to the ballet, and could not be moved.
Now the Viminal waits for reading the acts that will come from Bulgaria police, and then will take measures: in this case, the tiphosis arrested or identified in disorders can purify a Waspo for at least five years .
A International Dispose that prohibits the frequency of Italian cities, but also European.
In short, our hooligants will not make any more foot at the stage.
Happy.
But now this is the time of fear-emulation: it is to say that others are risking to add to hundred fifty first.
"We have to quit this fire immediately, and we don't justify those who do so" support the Viminal.
So, "guard the eyes very open, especially for the match of the national mercredi team in Lecce"
In the Pouilles, there is actually a small neighbor of supporters of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meetings, married the Casms who can even count on a section of the Aise, is to say secret services, which are just concerned with stage problems.
"The hearts Duce-Duce, and the arm holded during Mameli's hymne?
This is the opinion (expressed very not pleasant) of Domainico Mazzilli, a little while, Director of the Observatory of Viminal (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously predicted in Trieste where there was a novel of supporters of the Ultras Italian group, based in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria the lover of Mussolini is not a crime, but it is sure that the conduct of these 150-200 tifoses has been worried.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory #1 - the crimes must be assigned in the country in which the fact happens.
Before now, this group was remained in rules, now we will see what happened, and we will assess for the future.
But we also talk about sifflets against Mameli's hymne: those there are no crimes, but if you allow me, they're not cops."
