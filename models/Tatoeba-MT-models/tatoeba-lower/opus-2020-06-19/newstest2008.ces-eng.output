Inflation in Europe has increased for food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is caused in particular increasing increase of food prices.
The price growth in 13 euro areas was higher expected, after 2,6 per cent in October, the annual inflation was registered 3.1 per cent, reported the Luxembourg statistics of the Union.
The official proposal was only 3 percent, and the Agent Bloomberg was dealt.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the basic assets of the ECB from the United States, British and Canadian emissment banks with that reduction would be made together with the higher prices of survey and precision of unemployment to reduce inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to keep the peace of inflation under two percent, however in their nearby.
According to one of the analyses, the ECB is in absurd situation: the inflation must be "odradit" so that there is no business later.
In Germany, note inflation is 3,3 per cent of the 15-year record; then, in Spain, it is 3,6 to 4,1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has increased higher because of the prevalence of food and energy prices.
The term prices of the pseudo were 88 per cent, also the rate of the soil has received the highest values since 1973.
In the same way, in 2007, it was essential to pay more than oil and meat products.
The price of the world markets in this year is 52 per cent and the last month has already been a black gold barle at least 100 dollars.
According to the ECB inflation in 2008, 2,1 per cent of the aircraft to 2.5, however, in 2009, it is already 1,9.
According to the analysis, 12 months of inflation remains in the following 3-4 months close to 3 per cent, although its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
They are now expected that the ECB will be reduced in 2008 twice.
Gallup sees government crisis
The role of employees in Fidez after a long-term stage to the beginning of December has grown significantly, and now is available to the largest campaign since 2002, while in the case of the socialists of Gallup's institution, the 13 per cent of support has not yet been taken.
In the case of certain cholers of the parties, it would be differences - because of the greater decisive decision of the opposition of the ozone - has provided more than two-third (71 per cent) support to reduce the five-in support of MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are in accordance with the investigation under the entry for the income to the Parliament: their support in the framework of the whole population is two percent.
In the middle of the side electorers, both campaigns are one percent more.
The Statement of the Economy has also dealt with the preliminary minimum - not yet the amount of those who consider the economic situation of the country as very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while the situation is too bad in accordance with other 46 per cent.
The family values the change of their material situation after age and air expectations now more pessimists.
As regards the next year, most of the citizens are calculated with another wound and only tens with improvement.
In percentage, 71 per cent of the questions were judged, which is most of all the adequate investigations of the Gallup Institute that the premier executes his work almost worse than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsana believes or believes 13 per cent of the questions, while Victor Orbana is part of the partners of 38 per cent.
The Premier doesn't believe 54%, the President of Fidez's 27%.
One of the indicators of the development of political situation is how great a part of publicity is thinking that the unfortunateness of the premium is possible to resolve without a change of government.
While after the rural diseases, the Government and the premier were considered for 35 per cent, this share is now only 20 per cent, and the relative majority (33 per cent) only sees the solution in the writer of new options.
For the interest of the reference, 60 per cent of the issues were responsible for their events that would certainly come to the reference, and 20 per cent of others would likely come.
For comparison, the "parlament options of this week" would certainly be involved only 55 per cent and more 15 per cent considers its participation as possible. The reference efforts would be unbelievable on the basis of the present purposes.
The school would be not 74, the doctor 79 packs and the 84 per cent of the hospital.
If we look at the same parts only in the course of people who have promised their participation, then the introduction of schools, medicines and ranks for residence was rejected by 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most oldest is Aucan, at least the fifth of T Esc.
Hypermarkets in the Budaurus Trade Triangle maintained lonely, in average of 16 per cent of price failure with the difference that the years have not increased the DPH.
Article of the Journal of Napi Economic
The normal currency consumption table of Napi Gazdacity in the Budaurus Trade triangle triangle has increased in average of 16 per cent, however in all hypermarkets increased notices over thousands of forenses.
While the prices in the supermarkets of the "flights" have already been in the perincy, percentually not shown to the previous higher basis until so drastical disease.
However, for consumers, it is sure unfortunate that what the balls could buy quietly for the price under nine thousand forefathers is now not equal to ten thousand.
The use of the Day Economy in the studied hypermarkets has passed over the psychological border of ten thousand forensics at least 91 forensics.
The highest price was 10 573 forensics.
(In 2003, the consumer was 6 800 forensics.)
The price of Unica and the live fish remained a taxi on the lonely level, however, they had very disturbed the rods, the oxygens and the macks.
The prices of bread and meat were responsible for the data of the Central Statistic Agency, although we found kilogram bread and 139 forensics in Aucan.
The concurrence has not gone with the price of the product under 200 forensics.
It was also surprised in this area that the price of Coca Coca Coly in the free bed was under 200 forensics, so the product was only 257 forensics.
Yet, the year, according to the consumption board of Napi Gardenship Aucan, was the most oldest, while Cora was the most fair.
According to our accounts, the prices made in the use of the Napi Gazdacity journal with regard to the prices of the Monday Cora of 15, while T Esc and Aucan are about 18 percent.
In comparison with the highest and lowest value of the consumption was 12 per cent, while the growth between the lower and aeroplane is 21 per cent.
In the forensics, there was an average of 1 480.
The average increase of the price of the lens has resulted on 1 206 forensics with the impact of the DPH growth.
This process has returned, the trade houses have not been evidently able to decide how large price increases have been determined in individual products, as they couldn't prevent the impact of the price for the consumption.
(If the businessman states the speed of the product incorrectly, it may result in the price reduction of the adjusted intensity of the movement.)
With regard to the DPH, the price of the consumption market of Napi Gardenship declared so extremely that the price of the latest was 1 720 forenses above in 2006, although the price was made at the least of 844 forenses.
Years have not shown such a national difference, the oldest sheet remains now about 1 630 forensics more than the lens, and also the leaving of 1 284 forenses.
In comparison with both currency sezons, the highest catastrophic growth of price has resulted in less than 20 months of the day consumption in hypermarkets over 30 percent.
(On otherwise, not absolutely confirming the data of the Central Statistic Agency: it had in the case of several basic foods to increase prices over 30 per cent in 12 months.
Except eggs, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the last case, it seems to be impossible, as the price of the product, which has already been achieved in the long-term year, has shown in respect of the basis and in the worst case of the price growth over 10 per cent.
Additional eggs are intended to be more stronger than additives of eggs, drastical increase of prices has also been made in international strings.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle are not steadfast, still refer to a good year.
According to our experiences, most of the customers in three visited prices are no longer concerned.
Everybody's buying costs, sustainable foods will be buyed for payments.
In the middle of the middle of the three supermarkets, the long-term fronts were established in the board, because the number of visitors was immediately increased.
In particular, as we know, in the outside, it is less, most international chapters with research companys are increasing that the markets are reaching for their plans and not only for food but also for the sustainable consumption of goods.
On a lot of places, the desinfek environments are maintained
In aeroplane year, more than thousand cases of infections were recorded in hospitals, especially because of an inadequate antibiotic use.
Hygienic conditions of hospitality, fulfillment of bed, the performance of the staff is not helping, the primary of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they are also watching the desinfek environments.
Recently, the MRSA infection was diagnosed on the traumatological division of the Hospital John's hospital.
Bacteria against antibiotics were detected by a man who had received a serious transport accident.
The patient was Isoloved.
The similar infection was made at the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient infected in a serious autonome was released home, however, it had to return with MRSA infection and because of the battery in his body was not yet possible to be carried out one of the important operations.
The Nesocomialis Surveillance was reported in the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance to 1 094 hospital infections caused by multiresistent origin of disease, shared Karolina Böröcz, the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections made by multi-resistious origins of disease were registered in hospitals with sure, others do not know.
At least two thirds (683) infections were made by MRSA, or methycilin-oxacilin resistance with golden staphylok.
Bacteria Staphylococus aureus (SA) takes third people in a nase without a disease.
Infections made by SA (e.g. blow-shirts, mandels, cow infections, morning infections) are well responsible for antibiotics and should be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are increasing or incompatible, from the battery that is well responsible for antibiotics, which are very dependent on antibiotics, and which are in non-compatible hospital conditions are quickly wide.
First, in the case of transition or remaining bad immune functioning in patients with low body, low body steel, or in patients in years, may cause a serious disease infection, such as infection or blood respiration.
According to the highest doctor of Saint John’s hospital, nothing special, similar infection is in hospitals to the day practice.
"Infections can't be replaced with epidemies, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulas, "where the origin of the disease is not tested."
Reduces antibiotics
"These patients is isolated, a monitoring person is watching in the gas and mass and we need antibiotics", said Tibor Nyulas.
Patients accepted to the hospital are investigated before whether they are in their MRSA body, but the infection cannot always be disappeared.
Template selection is not in mode
The override majority of the hospital infections made by MRSA would be possible to prevent, however, the current conditions and conditions in hospitals are not for prevention and extension of multi-resistent origins of diseases, the Corporation of Karolina Böröča.
Since this infection is significantly proved in hospitals and households for seniors, the hospitals should control the patients accepted and the MRSA ports should immediately examinate.
The choice of microbiological models, however, in Hungarian diseases, is not in the way.
The role of this role is also that the National Health Fund does not finance this investigation.
The most of the cases have been reached if the patient does the MRSA-infective infection, she said the primary of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has an adequate antibiotic treatment in human medicine treatment, and there are also a home directive for treatment of individual infections, disease.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic treatment should be targeted or should be carried out microbiological research to reduce the resistance of medicines, however, or the hospital in all cases.
Microbiological models are in the basic, respective, ambulant investigation of patients, and Karolina Böröcz.
Securities on desinfekting environments
According to scientist evidence, MRSA is the most part of patients through health personnel.
That is why it plays a very important role of myths with the hands and the use of hands and mass, however, in the hospitals there are serious disagreements.
MRSA is transferred to captain infection and dose, however, in the conditions of hospitals, not always possible to isolate infected patients.
The rooms are often filled, the beds are often very close to themselves, if the epidemiological view should be at least 1,5 meters away from the patients.
As Karolina Büröča recognised, we can also see that in hospitals who are infected material situations, watching the desinfect media, the officers are a lot of and patients, which still increases the possibility of infection.
According to the Carolina Büröčes, there are where necessary protection measures are maintained, such infections are required less or can stop any further extension of the origin of the disease.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection provides for health insurance, therefore fights against it all over.
For example, in England, the Government has submitted the MRSA prevention programme, respectively reducing its exhibition.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to the public data, the MRSA infections in England increasing tendencies.
The European Preventive and Control Health Centre (ECDC) orders the prevention of multiresistent origins of disease (including also MRSA), the respective health infections made by these origins, between their priorities.
The police captain, who made a dead accident, wasn't depressed.
The official detective judge in the case of Captain XXII. Travel, which caused a dead accident, is ready.
The police captain XXII. was able to conclude that the traveller died in a crazy dead and, between its function, leaded under the influence of alcohol or sustainable substances, had informed the speaker of the Occident of the Prime City of Attila Morvai in the fifth after the end of the significant reason of this case.

(Recently named reality that the traveller has passed outside the aircraft, otherwise, according to the rule of the manufacturer rules, is not a polyestrial circumstances, but the car must also be presented.)
After transfer to the hospital, the traveler died.
For this event, the police director departed from the function and requested to transfer to the services, in accordance with the police report, because he was so threatened.
In the case, the investigation of the Budapest Research of the State Research.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former copy Captain had collaborated with the State Department of Implementing Research.
Other 400 million € for infrastructure
Agreement on three credit frameworks in the total value of 400 million € for the support of school, transport and environmental infrastructures, as well as the energy and energy signed in Budapest Minister of Jannes Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved in 2006 to finance the Ungarn budget projects for transport and environmental support of the Cohesion Fund, a framework for 300 million euros, as well as the parties have already concluded the credit agreement for 100 million, the currently submitted agreement is to use the remaining 200 million euros.

That may be, according to Janose Verese, in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB financed in Hungary since 1990 a total of 8,4 billion euros totally 113 projects.
The credits of the EIB provide for eight years of expectation and non-profits are based on EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real framework of the EU
The development of Bulgarian market with disabilities is extreme - the attention of the whole Europe is turned to a little declined Balkan country before.
What, where and who buys still the most lowest, however, quickly driving EU market?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
The most perspective of the East Europe's ability to buy ability is now in the absence of Bulgaria with its left cyber apartments and houses on the sea border.
From the mountains are the most shortest in the area of Banco, Borovc, Pamprovo and Vitoša, but Albena, Golden songs, Sunday borders, old city of Sozopol and Nesebar, however, more people still look for difference in Cavarny and Balkick.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria, there is an analysis of the company of Re/Max Bulgaria, the interests of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Grandico Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and still buys more interesters in the area of the left city of Russia.
The main city of Sofia is also the promise of loved opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is to be the best way to change in one of the most favorable golf gardens of Europe, and to be so close to the air and range of the targets searched for the road and the other two years.
Investors are already buying in large, for example, in the area of Bank.
According to the analysis, the ability to buy in Bulgaria tries to change their life and lifestyle.
Moreover, the customers come from England, however, the purchases from France, Belgium, Spain and still often from Romania.
There are also maltes and chips investors, in the Black Sea, and in the gardens are traditionally many Russian advocats.
Foreign purchases may be divided into three groups, named Georgij Jankov, regional director of the Re/Max Bulgaria.
Using people buy renewable diseases in $50-100,000 €, or the renewed old houses for 5-15,000 €, which then renew.
They require good accessibility and communication options, it is important for them the nearby of the large city, trade and control of the local doctor.
The second category is chat purchases (Bulharska has been arranged between the first 10 German recreation targets).
The third group creates commercial investors who sell in the hope of the achievement of values in the middle or long horizon.
The training of impossible in the main city is unforgiving, because the question is more stronger.
In Bulgaria, the less prices of implementing in the European Union, however, for the last five years, increased by 21 percent.
The increase of prices of imposability explicitly exceeds the growth of payments.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the information of the Minister of Environment and the Water Economic Gabora Fodora, the International Conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue the operation of the Ministers.
Officers and policies of 192 countries are in the world on the Bali Castle Map, which decides the following efforts after the reduction of the emissions issued by the Kyot Protocol fulfilled until 2012.
In this time, the debates of developing and growing countries are discussed about them.
The United States also announced that they are now not allowed to act on the exact numbers, although they are attached to the agreement to reduce the emissions of steel planes of 25-40 per cent in 1990.
Another greater conference is whether growth countries will contribute to the reduction of emissions to provide as material and technical assistance to countries which are rejected on it.
The Agreement also was born on demands for developing countries.
The Affairs Fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will lead to the Council 16-year-old guidelines, less in the context of the World Environment Programme (GEF) in the United Nations - we can learn in Piac and Profit magazine.
6 per cent of Hungary
The Minister of Environment and Water Economic Gabor Fodor, named Hungary, supports the EU to maintain the role in the effort of global climate protection and helping the new international agreement to 2009.
The Ministry stated that the EU would reduce the 2020 emissions of steel plants from 1990, independently on the success of the "Agreements after 2012", and is prepared to reduce 30 per cent of reduction in the case of the other developing areas of the world, respectively the developing countries would like to accept responsibility and responsibilities to their respective opportunity.
Gabor Fodor showed that the countries associated with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were achieved to reduce the value of 5,2 per cent, as well as the 15 Member States of the EU have been achieved to 8 per cent.
Hungary is a reduction of the emissments of steel plants of 6 per cent in 1985-87, which is fully fulfilled. - It is mentioned in the print report of the Ministry of Environment.
In Balli, it is much, because it is necessary to adopt the international agreement on long-term climate changes, otherwise its enterprise would be in vigor with a certain place until 2012. In such cases, it would not have submitted the obligations to reduce the Kyoto Protocol once a new system of reduction of emissions, on which the needs in its new report would also have been made by the International Scientific Conference of the United Nations with climate changes - IPCC, which only takes the Nobel’s entirety.
This would lead to reducing emissions and unresolvable increase of average temperatures on Earth more than 2 degrees of Celsia, which should be increasingly serious and irreversible consequences in accordance with the scientists.
The British Army leads a convention on YouTube
The British military units are published on the server to share videos from action in Iraq and Afganistan, whose own popularity.
YouTube first enjoyed British air forces (RAF): special units operating in Afghanistan from March 2006 read videos from action against Taliban, announced BBC.
The loads based on the miniature camera are controlled by the aeroplane driving operations in Kandahar area and then sent down to London where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political reference is unnecessary
This form has already received 139 tracts of British air forces, and their "channel" has been seen more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defenceheadquarters was registered on January 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishs a record of action in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry's border (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Nation in Afganistan
The increasing forces have published videos in accordance with their original purpose for the commission and in accordance with the Ministry of Protection are good and to announce large publicity with the real objective of the existence of military in the border.
"Propagation published by the traditional reviews of the religious religious reviews has almost nothing," advised the BBC on the question of the Protection of Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also needs to be a certain political report, because the special form confirms the right of military actions that the government has decided."
Americans did a game
The army makes care that, near the hardly corrected, censured records, the host also gets Amateric videos, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little absurd, "official" propagation films, such as the officers speak on losses, however, they don't make blood like battle.
On the other hand, there were many videos from the battle in Iraq and Afganistan, which took up at the front of the stage, however, the British army came on them until now.
Americans run a little different meeting - using a shooting game named America's Army, which is hard to load and in which the player can be able to get directly into the wood of soldiers.
At the Ministry's Friday with the tomb and the patterns
The Ministry of Monika Lamperth is obviously not sensitive: location of the feast of the feast is ordered for his collaborators for the final work meeting, on which with 2007 payments and coffee are distributed.
In some ministry, there will be a lonely with a living music, where the officers will tried to the officers of the feast atmosphere tombolu and the advantage.
Events, Sunday atmosphere, concerts and Swedish tables - so it's strong.
The State Offices are prepared for the Sunday.

On the Sunday Sirots, the children of falling soldiers are offered, at the missions of mission guests, family soldiers who are currently serving for foreign missions, but they also order the reception for newspapers.
Restaurant is achieved at the end of the year of 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will be raised by other restaurants.
The GKM's party is ordered in the centre Next Haza, for the entire 4 320,000 forensics, and from six hundred ministers are expected at about 300,50 hosts.

The NFÜ Sunday was 4 700 000 forensics and consists in the middle of the State Justice Council (OIT) - were concerts and dinner.
The room was a million forensics, the rest was based on more than four hundred invitations.
It seems that one of the NFÜ sections are invited to further celebration: here a company of ensuring tender procedures, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG) from the Union's money.
For this purpose, they pronounced Vigzinhaz's building.
MAG and .s. not confirmed this information because we couldn't have been able to attach the corresponding person.
The cloud doesn't need
The OIT building was not only NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, where the Sunday place was ordered on 7 December.
Nevertheless, the OIT did not want to use its salts.
The plane participated in five hundred people.
The party started a healthy minister, and after evening, it was possible to dance for living music.
According to the response to the question of the portal [origo] on the ground, there were no need for evening clothes or clouds.
Puritán's birthdays achieve health, work and local samoses.
The Ministry of Health Organizes the programme and honor for employment for 400 000 forensics in its own building.
The Ministry of Monika Lamperth cooperators even not officially called to celebration, but to final work meeting.
It is calculated by hundreds eighty hosts who, according to the distribution of the printing distribution, have only got a coffee and pattern, so it will be sufficient for 350 000 forensics on the party.
Minister for local samoses Gordon Banai is more easier to drink in the Ministry School for local samoses and regional development.
The Ministry of Financial (PM) coordinates the conference of 436 workers in their own large salary.
At the feast party, 2 500 forenses on the host - total party includes receipts with the Swedish tables and accessories.
Since the Minister Janos Veres is, PM workers serve in the same way each year.
However, the atmosphere will be mistaken, the official is not only the ministry, but also the afternoon of the end.
The Agriculture Restaurant of Agricultural Receives on 20 January, the Ministry's Honor is not fulfilled.
The receipt of the exploitation in Vajdahunyadwater in the cities and, according to the Ministry's Communication, for hundred hosts, 1 000 forests are defined for person.
According to the printing section, a very simple receipt on which only are invited to the competent foreign diplomats in Hungarian.
These receipts start a short health ministerial and ends a detailed exploitation.
The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Education and the Culture of Pennsylvania has not agreed, has shared the portal [orego].
The price of officers of the environmental resources were not able to share in the print separation.
In each case, four hundred people were invited to be organized on the party in the U.S.C.
It's shooting to the shooter
The Board of Research Liga, the respective respective of the employment Council (MOSZ), creates its stage Commission for coordination of lunarly unlimited stages.
In the Sabbath, the protest public meeting will be finished, on the Sunday, on the end of the law on health security, the work will be stopped.
The action will certainly make a serious interruption of transport because it is at least completely stopped the fertilization transport and will also stay the Budapest transport business employees (BKV).
On the fifth of the afternoon, the membership of Liga shall notify the membership with the Celostat's Working Council with the details of the organizated lunch stages.
The LIGA - MOSZ Commission, which will coordinate the lunch action.
In the Sabbath, the protest public meeting is finished, since the Sunday, the meetings that are connected to the stairs are stopped working for an unexpected time if it does not happen to the agreement with the government.
This means that there is no term for the end of the stage that begins in the Parliament's vote on the law on health insurance.
If the Parliament had not finally received the law on health insurance, the elections of consultation to the staff will immediately get up.
However, if the legal legislation is devoted, the stakeholders shall be made by the Commission and shall decide on another procedure.
According to the Monday meeting, the Parliament is also possible that the law on health insurance will be voted until in the late evening, accidentally night hours.
For the lunch starting stage, it is possible to be calculated with several interruptions of transport: on the fertilization the work will be stopped for a period of unexpected time, the later part of the Budapest merchandise and more than half of the Volan company.
Today, many countries will also be achieved to close the half of rural roads.
Reading and citizen organisations have been linked to the examination of the stages, which are not yet updated on the Liga meeting pages.
Some organizations have noticed a stage for an unexpected time, others have reported a temporary stop of work.
To the fourth day, Hungary State Roads (MAV) and the Independent Research Workers (VDSZZ) did not agree even to sufficient services, and then the beginning of feasts of feasts walk after the winters of any more people.
In accordance with the EVB, from the beginning of 13 hours, from 7 to 9 hours morning with the Budapest Airport, the four-hour stage of the four-hour steel of employees in the energy LIGA, to 2-, respectively 2-8-hour labour labour, election of the Department of Pedagogs and Democratic Democratic Department Pedagogs.
Hungarian medicines will stick directly throughout the country, the Democratic Democratic Research bond of workers in health and the Social Affairs (EDDSZ), relating to the Cooperation Forum of Department Services (SZEF), is a two-hour-hour-forward stage.
The most important of the four requirements for the membership of Liga is to reject the proposal of health reforms and to provide the public discussion of a new concept.
The second request is to be a new way of calculation of the costs valid since the next year.
Third to ensure the possibility of ensuring the system for the appropriate worksquarters before 2010.
The fourth reason of the action is that the Independent Research officers of the ferry employees (VDSZZ), which fall under the membership of Liga, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economic and the transports relating to fertilizers, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian guarantee increased the risk of the country
Action of the Hungary Gards based on support for Jobbik Hungary in August of the Aeroplane, according to Division Analysis Risk (Risk Analysing Division), the Institute of Political Capital increased immediately in some views of the political risk of Hungary and all areas.
In the "risiko-attention" company, it is written: In the context of the activities of the Hungary Gards, the greatest political risk is that "the extent of the existing ethnic infection between the Roman and the Neroman citizens of Hungary may have a shorter time to become violent ethnic thresholds."
The main reason is that the Hong Kong's political strategy is likely to explore such actions - adds a research institution.
As it is written, it can explain one of the largest Ungarn political representatives: "The public debates on Roman question have left the representatives of the public life of the representatives of radically and extremist political purchases, which were able to establish a political strategy in Roman-Madian."
This problem deploys, disabilities the normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the probability of the impact of violent conflicts - the court of the institution.
Furthermore, the guard of Hungary, according to the investigation institution, influenced the great attention of households and foreign media "with significantly showed the image of Hungary in the west, especially what is the faith in the situation of the country and its democratic growth."
The Institute reminds that a part of the reorganisation of the Ungarn's radically and ultratransport groups, which are still greater publicity and integrity since 2006, is that in Hungary since 2007 a number of organizations who are named themselves as "national households".
"There is that they define themselves as a citizenship, while they are openly published - and weapons - preparing their members to fulfil the defenced tasks (in the case of living catastrophes, inhabitants of power, destruction of the right), and also with an insufficiency of police, army, or if the State,” adds.
It further notes: it is all happening in the way it is trying to deal with the most different political efforts imposed in relation to policies and parties to civil route.
In this case, civilization and community are therefore not only served to exceed judicial recording, but also political strategy.
According to analysis, the activities of the Hungary Gards are also a higher risk of the consideration of subsequent relations.
"In the past months, the Hungarian Garden shows immediately in several neighborhood States as a potential resource of danger, the ultra-nationalistic political representatives of some neighborhood countries want to forgive their own protimary policy.
All of this can affect the political stability of the area," adds.
According to the investigation institution, Hungary Gards are not in the middle and Eastern Europe’s uniform aircraft, so it has increased political risks for the area as a whole.
As it is written, the activity of the Hungary Gards is like the activities of Bulgarian National Gards, which the creation announced in August 2007 of the Intergovernmental Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
On the Background of the Bulgarian gardens, massive rooms that appeared in one of the sophical fourth (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has used to establish a garden with that the purpose of the organization is "national household".
In the 17th age, there was an "Terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained inactive and lowly, remembering the Political Capital Institute.
He adds that the initiative has called a bunch of Bulgarian publicity.
As further writes, the increase of the risks of ethnic thresholds signifies the notification of some bulgarian Roman organizations that they create their own garden for the sign of resistance.
Since the adequate activity of the Hungary Gards shows comparison with the activity of Bulgarian National Gards, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Romans also react to the same way, with the equipment of their own households, we can notify the risk of the political capital institution.
Attila Yuhás, a research director of the Institute of Political Capital: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, the analysis of risks gives each year and if he finds something that could affect risk changes, they report public measures as in this case to give risk warnings.
The feasts are not all free
In Hungary, there are days that would have been exactly established by the law, and it has already been the current practice that the celebrations are moved to work days, which are waiting for us in the next year less times.
In the European Union or in America there are no party units.
The Hungary law system differs national and State feasts and days of work challenges.
The day of work peace is most important to church feasts or to a significant story event.
We also celebrate New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a job free - for a new year, that people can be reposed after Silvester.
In the year, we have 11 free feasts.
The National Holiday is 15 March of the glorious revolution from 1848 and 23 October, the Memorial Day of Revolution from 1956.
On August 20, we appreciate the obligation of the State, 1 May, 1 and 2 November, we remember dead relatives and friends.
Moreover, there's two-day feasts of Velikonoce, Latvia and Wednesday.
Since our State, national or religious feasts, according to the calendar of the office, were a weekend, the work was to move the day of work in cases we would work before the free celebration or after it only one day.
The price for long weeks is, of course, that we stay at work and in school.
The day when the party comes directly or follows after it, we're going to work for a long year in a special minister of work.
The regulatory provision is the same measure to all employees and their employees, public employees and persons in public service.
However, the firms and institutions that are in the operation of non-interruption or in respect of their definition are also working peace in the days of work.
Years will be changed only around the celebrations at the end of the year: since 24 December, the life in the country will stop so far, because, according to the supply experiences, most people are in the days between the Sunday and Silvestrem before "reaching" or thus uses the freedom of allowance.
In the next year, some of our feasts will fall in the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the movement of the work day will be less than a year.
First, the Calendar moves around the party of the work, so that the workers could stay home for four days.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day to be at least Friday 2 May.
The next move is related to the celebration of October 23: On October 18, it will work in place of fifth 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be able to fulfill all the feasts, because from 24 December they will have almost all non-stops empty, although Silvester looks at the middle.
Six fearing little girls you can pack your colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, unjust lying that we don't remember: it's all "screaming" every day on work.
The question is, if you are usually usually, or you're putting the hands and the worst situations that others can disappear, you'll be exhausted.
Type.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they looked for you from the marketing section," tells you the colleague.
That's why you've been cutting a myth?
In the best case, it will be striving and try to correct it, if it is called to the marketing separation and says that it has forgotten to submit (that is less common solution).
Most often, it's resolved once.
Before it comes to a disappointment, it is good to think about what you could prepare to colleagues a minute inappropriate, and you know that you're trying to do it.
Do you think something isn't yours?
There's nothing worse than if you get a letter, office need or your phone, and they're not there.
Remember you've put you on the table yesterday, but at the morning it's gone?
Or did you discover some of the colleagues on the table that you thought you were lost?
You don't take anything from your colleagues, otherwise, they'll hurt you that you're able to do it.
Don't get out of the office of the office or the best papers, because it may be inadequate when you come before, and you will need them immediately.
Doctors of private life of colleagues?
There's no good solution to stop the shoes.
Who, with who did he?
Where and why?
Don't let everybody in your neighbors reports about the private life of the colleagues!
When some of them will be divided with you about their inside secrets, don't use his trust!
Stop what you have heard, and don't interpret with your friends, nor when he knows his things and others.
You're not able to report your absence?
If you call to the office and call on a strong pain of head you report your absence because you're not good, or you're saying you're happy to rest today, you think your job, unexpected tasks and work that you have a certain term, you'll have to do somebody else.
Look at your colleagues!
If you know before you're not going to work on the second day, or that can happen something for what you're going to stay home, tell it that your colleagues and leaders don't be confronted with your absence until the second day.
Use, smoking, phone
Did you go to the work that the group will get you out of the colleague?
Would you like to be a witness of a phone conversation that would be better to hear?
Don't break your collaborators with consumption, singing, speaking (including over the head), or dumping, unfortunately clothing, an unfortunate voice.
All of this may be moved, even when it is not just attached to a project (write, planning, organization).
Are you committed to the other mistake?
If there's nothing at the time or you forgot to send an important letter or reference, don't deny your forgiving others!
Don't call a accidental chaos leading in the office and a deep college!
You know, if you were wrong and somebody paid it, and make it new!
Ask how you could give things all right, make an unbalance!
Are you feeling too much in the office?
Thinks and patterns: a suitable clothes on the house, however, in the office doesn't happen!
Don't take your free time, even if it allows your profess!
Don't be worried, honor your colleagues, and you'll come to the office in regular rooms - and if that's your professor requires, beautiful and elegant!
When a man wants to get out, he stops to be interested
Eating in the normal morning shopping.
The radio calls special melody: the sound of the plots to which electronic effects are connected.
I'll add the volume.
The music changes the time and to the previous tone color is added to bas, then as a real clename connects the woman’s congregation.
At the Mr2 station, the Zagar group is called Wings of Love.
The long-term musical life has not discharged us with the quality electronic pool.
It's the only one, but it seems a lot of different because you just listen to the new Zagar album.
Yonderboy, some new and interesting productions from the house-based digital subground, the total image of the entirely changes shortly, although it is a garage rock in the way of guard rock with its kitchens, and the home electricity shows that it's something new under the sun.
Balass Züger started in the Fifteen, and he also played in Yonderboy Capel, until he ended - even because two stickers would not go to one chair - he delivered their own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that associates the elements of jazz, electronic tane styles and pope, he started to process until it was called to compose film sound tracks (e.g.
Film Ference Turkoa "Szezon").
His formation, playing at the beginning of small clubs, learned a larger public after the magazine wan2 ordered their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important home dexes and published Zagar in Yonderboy for a tackle of the only home subjects that could be sold as well as in the Safade.
Zagar and his head are unbelievablely "in the curse," but nobody of course asked if they were satisfied with this other.
The head reacted as it is: she made new, better album.
Now the given album named Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open them new paths, although the single name is trying to create an opportunity for the beginning years in the Fitchikostle.
It's also one verse of the oldest captains of Balases Zöder.
The reference to eternity, the aircraft would be on the place, however, next to the electronic idea of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, thirty times - voting cytar, influence of rock and role.
In these songs, it presented a song of György Ligeti in the Millennium park, which worked currently in England with the The Puzzle group.
The album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Peōfi, playing last time from the morning to the evening of the popular music, began to exhaust a large Wings of Love melodies, recorded with six home songs ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right.
Portal hvg.h says Balases Zöer.
hvg.h: In relation to this new hit, how much is the rest of what you play, the road music?
Balass Zýer: Definition of the royal music is nothing very significant for me.
According to me, there are two different chats of easy music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even such an alternative, underground music can be broken, nothing says, and just so it can be just because of the sale that it does commercial.
In particular, a good packing trace can be driving from the faithful internal needs.
This spirit also works as accepted, independently on languages and national borders.
hvg.h: Do you see a different difference in the opening of the Hungarian and foreign public of your music?
B. See: In the front, especially from us to the west, the easy music has greater tradition.
There's not just teengers and people after twenty, but too old.
Moreover, the changes of easy music moved around them because they also consider it as part of the court culture.
hvg.h: What's the role of public in your work?
Do you think who's going to listen to your music, where, and how much?
B. See: Of course, it is a good feeling that our concert is going for more people.
But we never did music for the market.
The music is not born with a goal, but for any reason.
The role of the public is aware of the concerts where it already works on each other, but it is hidden only in unemployed changes.
However, I realized that if someone wants to publish the public, he stops to be interesting.
hvg.h: How much can you follow the example of Yonderboy?
He works only and his carrier has just built from us on the west.
B. See: We really don't have his way, not depending on that our music sometimes try to explain.
We're almost a team of players who look at the musical attitude of the second and leave it to develop.
Of course, it wasn't going to get out that our work would not be compared to Yonderboy's tracks, because some of us were separated from his caps and went out to another way.
hvg.h: In the top of the station mr2 Peōfi, the Wings of Love has received the first place.
Many heard the name of Zagar first in relation to this track.
You know, you've opened a larger level with a popular style?
B.Zs.: We didn't have to write hit in the plan, which we should sell the cup.
It's more in that song.
We thought it as a final album that we tried to release the previous audio body and the more complex theme.
Hvg.h: How did you choose those six songs?
Why is it just -- what was the main principle?
B.Z.s.: The President was to create such a joke of congregation.
Then the idea came to construct this congregation with a solitaire home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-year - then Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peters, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which then we crucified on Underground Divas.
Hwg.hh: You just thought that song, or girls made something on her?
B.Zs.: The track has already existed in the instrumental version when the material came on the board, we said that there would be something more necessary for this track.
He's able to add a song part to him.
The evening I singed on him the melody that the girls later learned.
It's almost first and terriblely spontaneously.
I remember how it was, but of course it was needed for Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so powerfully.
hvg.h: As on the bed, the concert appeared to be girls in the back.
They're not only (including Judy Jay), they don't have their own roles, they can totally sing together, and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't only make their songs.
It also stayed back on the west.
Does that mean?
B.Zs.: That that stayed back was only because of technical problems.
That we didn't want to divide the only role, it's even important.
And this song is about to forget our ego, from where it is, and to just leave the rods of love, the weakness of love.
I would like to feel this European state that we felt when the song was born, and the others.
hvg.h: What's the best work?
B.Zs.: While music compounds actually even with one, the hard cows have been made almost at the mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I played on a concert steel, or Rock'n'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work on the floor, then all kinds of nice found his place as in some composer.
hvg.h: What track of the new disk is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's still changed by concerting and because I've already been released here.
Now it's the prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Conditional macler risked billions of minority
Great defraudant.
This marks his hard employment Jerome Kerviel France Bank Gigant Social General, Leader of Tunisia Commercial Bank.
She's coming because of him, it's just about $5 billion billion eur.
Well, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compare his colleagues and even unreasonable.
In different ways from all the large bank houses, the crisis on the American market has been distinguished.
"He's seriously lower," he claimed out of his mouth of the overseers who sent a police on him.
But as the explanation of Kervielo's expressions that brought the French media, such as the journal Le Monde, was a person who had at the end of the long-term year of his cyclic business in over 1,6 billion eur.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to buy money for my bank," he says in explanation.
In the year, he was just able to build half billion eur in America.
The opportunity has already felt at the beginning of the year.
In the case, the reports were started to show that such sub-private hypothesis, provided by neighborhood clients or those who had problems in the past, will have problems.
The impact on the whole economy of this crisis wasn't supposed to have.
Kerviel didn't believe that, and he made it right.
At the end of the year, then his smoke was spread up to 1,6 billion eur.
"When I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to tell it," admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't leave anything to himself.
In all audience, he admits that he's false records so that he doesn't come to him.
He even had the boss, even when he started interesting Eurex's bus.
Risk was a risk
Was it afraid he's coming to him?
You're not.
"I thought it was just a simple fact that I made 1,6 billion for the bank, it's gonna be happy."
Where did he take so many risks?
He had to work on his position.
To the General Sociéte, he ran in 2000 after he got the university in Lyon.
His annual payment moved about 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, it was already an assistant, and in 2005 it became a solitary macler with a year-day payment of $90,000.
But he knew that he would never do so much else.
"Yeah, at my first conversation in 2005, I knew they lost me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development, Kerviel wrote to researchers.
But the first great success came soon after the ransom.
Thanks to the action of Allianz, at the bomb attacks in London, he raised this title half billion eur.
And it was a launching mechanism, he wanted more.
Before you're doing it, let's leave you.
"It's like a snow cool," he said to the police.
But the boss knew all of them, or sometimes touched.
"Think I did money, they've got the eyes."
Only the morning came to the beginning of this year.
On the only day he lost a billion eur.
After a week in half a year, he wanted to get it.
When he came to work on the Sunday, he didn't work in the bank anymore.
And the bank reported about a few days later that it was about five billion € for him.
How did they come to him?
The surprise became because of his allowed.
"I just chose four days for the last year.
Machleur that doesn't allow is a machler who doesn't want to look at him in his records," she closed Kerviel.
The cheque has the chance to get 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government yesterday with the European Commission have signed the full of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion eur in the next year (aproximately 365 billion corners).
It is a range of half of the total parts that can receive the Czech from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
At least 125 billion crown will go through seven operating programmes in the regions.
The Czech Company will be able to get about 100 billion corners from the Company and Innovation Programme.
More than 150 billion money, it's going to driving.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents to 22 per cent of the environments that the CRR can receive from the funds.
This money is the higher budget of the State Fund for transport infrastructure, which will be the next year to economy with 90,8 billion corners.
The Agency and Innovation Programme shall serve businessers and companies to get media for innovative business.
The company should be financed for the implementation of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
In the assessment of money from the EU funds, the CHR is in the framework of the newly accepted countries between at least successful.
Twenty-year-year penalty for the representative of Nikaragui confirmed the judgment
The Court of Revocation in Nikaragui confirmed the twenty-year-year penalty for the former President of Arnold Germany, which was condemned in 2003 for a financial supply of $100 million (see 1.8 billion corner).
However, later, he was released from prison and lived in a prison at his hazardous hazardous metropolis.
If the head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 returns back to a middle, it is not clear in accordance with the AP Agency at this time.
According to the Chairman of the Revocation Court of Ilean Perez will now be concerned with prisoners, if Germany allows to approve his challenges home, or he consents to prison.
For four years ago, the Court of Germany showed that he regularly moved the government money to the account of the Foreign Affairs in Panama.
These companies were efficient and accounted in the fact of his relative and neighborhood.
Some of these money were then finished in the fund that Germany founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they agreed to us.
That's right.
The statement was accepted.
What is this extraordinary payment?
It is the first budget established by this Government and accepted majority of coalition without support of obsession.
The aeroplane year was still with the CSSD support, because he prepared the Ministry of Sobotk and the CHSSD could not allow him to receive it.
On the difference of the rural debate before the unbelieving government has done nothing dramatic.
The messenger's dream of this traditionally surprised, although the most influenced, the law approved in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends in individual chapters and items of budget, so that it pleases or does not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden for the powerful support of governments with opposition.
It's medically more thanks, so he's taking much more attention in medias.
Political advice is more interesting than stripper numbers for publicity.
The state budgets in the past social democratic governments have suffered three diseases that have not been able to resolve at the same time:
The first of them is a high part of the law of obligations, including mandatory expenditure, which are not only costs, but also social doses that were approved in the past year before choices.
One of them is a deficit economic as a result of the disease of the first.
Third limits are the deficits of public finances, including the deficit of the budgets of cities and foreign.
However, this risk is not the deficit of the State budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
However, the periodic bomb is the deficit of the budgets of the cities and the foreign.
Many officers that, except the money of the bank, payments and credits, get more investment resources, often give the obligations that they were incompatible with their advice.
In the past years, these debts have been granted by the energy and other development networks that have received from the State from privateization.
Now they're not here anymore.
If we only keep official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy goes for a few years, like the rest of the world, the growth fase, which is not still ChSSD.
It was a unique opportunity to give her governments public finances.
Instead of this, the state has still served more.
Other lands, at a couple of exceptions such as Hungary, Albanian, Pakistan or Egypt, were more understanding than our Republic.
It's a serious assault that falls especially on the past government.
We compare among the countries that are in the global measure, at least the poverty.
It is therefore not necessary for massive social programmes which, in the last years, had been fully gained in gigantic dimensions.
Although a part of the nonsensitive popular expenditure, approved years before the elections, so if in the nearby time, it is not possible to reduce the border of the department to the pension and the pension reform, then it will actually end any policy in this country, so that anyone will rule it only.
With a small survey, it is said that government policies will be officers, mechanically distributing most of the money given to the costs and social doses.
It is therefore not possible to be an aeroplane of revolutionary, but it can only stop extracting normal expenditures by mandatory.
The planned deficit for up to 70 billion for 2008 would be sufficient if the last government would not have done what could be done for the last ten years.
If we don't want to realize that the government policies are only officers, then we must be patient and entrusted with this strong coalition government, which is convinced that the State can only give a lot of things that can get on data and posts, quiet to prepare other reform laws.
Only those authorised accession of the comprehensive State budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis on financial markets.
It's likely to get more than 100 billion dollars on the mining markets through the auction.
In these accommodations, the banks have a rate of peace for which they are able to pay money.
For example, the American Fed is so sent to August 40 billion dollars, and the other 40 more accessible European and Switzerland Central Bank.
It is after the attacks of the 11th September first, which the central banks of individual States have agreed to such a coordinated procedure to reduce or reduce the consequences of financial crisis.
"This step has to resolve the greatest difficulties of economics, so the growth of the free capital that the banks could be solved," wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group.
"Coordinated central bank actions increased the probability of reaches in the United States of 65 per cent and 50 per cent," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already arrived for $60 billion because of non-country, especially in the United States.
Analytics wait for more billion losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what can be followed when they decided for this process," said ABN's main economy Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," added.
The Central Banks are afraid that if banks have the same difficult access to the banks, they will also have their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and send an American economy to reach with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks decided that after reducing the LIBOR sazb, the London International Bank Sazbe, which is used to pay money on the interbank market.
It was meaning that the banks had still fear of the payment of money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have reached their rate of rate sometimes.
"It's gonna have the same effect as the other smoke of the sazeb," said Agent Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analyticals do not believe that the step of central banks will help to bless the crisis because it doesn't solve the basic problem, and it's a loss of unability market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
The global changes of climate have to be the most vulnerable to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus reiterated the problem of global exploitation.
The criteria has now been made at the end of the International Conference of the United Nations Changes on Bali.
In Vidni, where he presented his Blue Book, no green planet, he showed that the ecológies debates are incredible.
According to Klause, the conference structure is not only acceptable, which creates a significant amount of governors and non-governmental organizations, but also the basic differences between the retory which carries it, and the reality.
"The debatte is entirely not structured, it's just a firework of words that are replaced for the solution of current problems," said Klaus.
The President of the Czech President in the presentation of his books showed that her theme is very important for him, and therefore it is so angry for them.
He also expressed a pleasure that the book appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I'm sometimes meet only with the caricature of my opinions."
Now, the interesters can read his unknown position.
Klaus remembered that it wasn't a climatetolog, but, according to his opinion, he had sufficient provisions to write such books.
It is, therefore, academic, able to monitor and promote a good uniform, has experience with statistics, and it is also a national economy.
In the main conclusion of the books, he noted that the climate changes still and that its changes are therefore normal that all scientists do not have a suitable view that the results of the current changes are not too large and serious, and therefore they do not prevent the threat and that the trying to affect climate development are sufficient, ineffective and inacceptable.
Furthermore, as a person’s experiences with totality, it is considered that an inacceptable introduction of the opinions of non-provided others, which encourages as dangerous freedom limits.
At the questions of the future, he explained that it is not against "the understanding of environmental protection, but against the balanced environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use."
On the same subject, Klaus was talking to Vidni two months ago in the Hayeko institution.
The director couldn't change 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers have proceeded a length and did not have to change an old driver's test, whose validity has expired the end of the year.
Today it is the last day when people can ask for exchange that the officers still have to make a new test to them until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is afraid that after the New Year, it would be issued on the strategy of manager statistics without a valid right.
According to the officers, they didn't change the evidence of those who don't want to rule anymore.
While the entire interests of the equipment, the offices in the metropoli have been denied by requests and the interest of the exchange of tests this week has grown.
Mastership is packed around 2000 customers every day.
In the fronts, the front is waiting for half hours.
In Praia, the guideline has not yet changed the rate of 140,000 managers.
The establishment of a new test is twenty days.
But it's possible to ask for exposure for five days.
In this case, the manager will pay five hundred corners.
The motorists who are debt to exchange the test will not be able to end the year, and they'll go out to the street without a valid driver will be threatened from the year.
The Provincier will pay maximumly two thousand corners.
But the police can solve an interruption and agreement.
In the case of administrative transition, the temptation is exposed to 2500 corns.
According to the previous information, it could get a trial from the council and a person who doesn't get out of it.
So it could also be 30,000 corners.
The Ministry called the authorities to be peaceful and maintain the highest thousands of coronal trials.
According to the Ministry of Transport of Karla Hanzelki, the tenth trials are not worse to anyone.
The rural test is according to the evidence where people can decide whether they want him or not.
It's not a citizen evidence that every person must be valid.
People who don't want to lead to get a guidance.
It is sufficient to submit it or to send an recommended mail to the competent general Office.
With the end of the year, the tests issued in 1964 to 1993 are stopped.
But the motorists have to also change other types of guidance.
People with evidence from 1994 to 2000 have more than three years of time.
The payment of the tests provided for in 2001 to 2004 is finished in 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it's about 2,6 million other evidence.
The Court reduced the crimes to detectives held with Berdich
The policeman Josef Opava and Peter Koňarzyk, who are invited to be committed by a criminal collection with David Berdich, will go to prison for thirty and ten years.
With a definitive obligation on this decision, the rural Supreme Court decided to reduce their trespasses, one for the year and the second for two years.
The Detectives of the Trade Detective for the fight against the organized crime of 14 and 12 years.
Without this decision, it is possible to be accepted only to the Supreme Court.
Even in this case, the branches are also required, but now waiting for the primary value.
However, in other processes, he has already received crimes in over 16 years.
He can't get any more.
The Court of Justice in January, in particular, recognized the participation of the 19-year-old overfalls, the Supreme Court concluded the challenge of 16 of them today.
Most accused requirements from the beginning of the investigation refused that it was designed.
According to the Central Secretary-General, the police competents, without other agreements with Berdique, transmitted criminal information from the police resources, covered a single suffering, and helped the members of the gang to disappear criminal responsibilities.
Gang gave 30 per cent for Opavu and Cognac.
It is required for the criminal action of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about the suffering of the victims often had a serious new health, but also on the disagreement of the powers of the public act and the unreavoided weapons.
At home views, the police discovered illegally maintained guns, shooting with oil nucleus, laser officer or self-shooter.
Gang, according to the accusation, came to ten million corners.
Moreover, twenty men in this process have already recognized the judges of the other Berdich's struggle and a number of other people.
Other men from Berdich around are still talking about in another process, some cases were not admitted before the court.
The main training was then disappeared to Tomási Póto and Maroshi Schuljo, who lived in Irish design, where they wait for a definitive decision on their guidance to move to the Republic of the Czech Republic.
Account for Child: 12 million
For the purpose of children in the birthday, Igor Veleba wants 12 million crowns, more judicial excuses.
For each mother after three millions, for his father for two millions and for children for a million.
The hospital offers maximum of 200,000 for each parents.
The officer of the hospital Ondrey Dost is therefore not agreed with the proposal of Veleby.
"We reject the requirement, that's very high," he said, "It's enough after today.
"To make a view to this contrary, we need a famous condemnation that has left the opposite.
Let's see if he's absolutely valuable.
But we're thinking that it's going to be in statistics for everyone," he said Doststal.
The party should be moved between 100,000 to 200,000 Kich for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the family of Jablonia, she wanted every month when she didn't get her biological daughter, million corners.
Veleb served as a basis for the exhibition of a remote detective proceedings that made for him a Faculty hospital in Praze-Motole.
Child parents, according to psychology and psychiatry, have suffered psychiatric new and stress in various grades and depths.
The stress situation was better for the men, even when they were involved with the students that they did not protect the newspapers.
Women are raised up again with the current useful trauma and what happens right now, broke the contents of Veleba.
Veronic and Nikola have changed health sisters in the territory birthday of the row of 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Nermslavic and Veronika to Libor Brosch and Jaroslava Trojans to Jablonia.
Heytman of the Supreme Miloš exploited the end of October, every family of 100,000 corners for the replacement of expenditures that had been mistaken to the threat hospital that the country has raised.
All hospitals in Czech are insured from the law on the responsibility of the worries.
In the case of the survey, they must go to the reserve fund, except for the assistance of the distributor may be requested.
The courts were still admitted to people a low low disagreement, the sums were calculated according to the table in statistical lines, except million corners.
The half came about the Valash Kingdom
The Boek of Pollyka has lost a sport of the Valash Kingdom.
According to the Court of Australian National Court, he first used the mark of a certain king, but the project built a long-term work team around Thomas Harabish, who cooperated with the heart.
The half was not involved today.
According to his lawyer, but it's probably not finished and the client's calling.
"Sport is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parazited to the popularity of Bolka Polyvky," said Polyvkov's lawyer.
According to him, all of them will save the word of the Valash Kingdom just the herd and the comic.
It's the same way he's got Harabish.
"It's at least 10 years of work.
Taking money and thinking actions," he said.
He's a lot of money according to him.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and could have something about it.
They want to parazise our job," adds.
Lucrative residues
According to the Court of Justice, a certain king first used Polyvka in his TV order.
In 1993, Radoslave Brzobohatti was her hero.
But then it was not agreed to build a efficient kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came with a thought of training barshots.
From the original research action, the trade and the lucrative business activities were excluded, where Harabiš had submitted to the Kingdom of Valash.
In 1997, Polyvka agreed with his name and signature in the ships, and even offered their staff holders by visiting its farms and divadal representations.
Who's used on the throne?
The Court also showed that Harabish only used the hot idea that Polyvka published in Maneji for his business purpose.
"The Popularita Boleslav's Pool of the Project of Valash Kingdom has certainly been helped," she said to the court.
But he added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team who was intendiously gained him.
The cooperation of the exploited parties has continued until 2000, when Harabish for the Pollution was organized in the Vestician official cornation.
Since that time, it started between the Polish and the Harabish grouping of sports, which had explanated the "King Boleslav I."
The rule in the Kingdom was then on the ground of Harabish, Jarmila, the Sul, as the Queen Mother.
In 2002, Pollyvka delivered to Harabish and his inquiry company which the court rejected today.
It would be clear to the sports to bring the Harabesh claim of the throne and half of the princess.
He should go out of the new king.
He didn't want to see details and terms yet.
"We don't want anything to do.
It should be something like the king's carrier on the Slovak.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
And Mr. Pollyvka can log in quietly," he added Harabish.
Test Peugeotu 207 SW 1.6 VT: Consumed courts
Actually, I've never found a lot of Peugeot 206.
His equipment properties had no power, quality of equipment, management, and products would also be able to indicate tracks for average.
But on the market, Peugeot 207 is now, and he's too better.
And the SW's named is still about the bottom, and I'm not staying better than thinking.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I was able to smoke on the head on the back-sheets.
This is the end of the end, because the carrier of the combine means that they're not driving in this direction or two meters long.
I'm the world
I'll go to the interests very quickly so I can't get a lot of back.
It's about the whole design, where I've got the only outcome to the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate something more designer investment when the car looks so elegant.
The sittings are agreed, and they are there the time we could be able to smooth on a short seat or a shooter.
The same side guide was explicitly improved against the model 206.
Whatever the space is here, it's feeling the increase of the dimensions of the carcery.
Then, in the company, there's already a statement of the lack of place over the head.
Cuberry
That's the main of this car, so he's his officer.
I have to determine this as very well accessible (and also thanks to the back-up window) and as a fully able.
The deep places are built by locked steams that are ideal compromise.
It's not recommended, it's going to get up, and then he's keeping more difficult objectives.
But we're going to stay together over the bottom.
This is according to the table in the basic order of 428 l, which is against competition a average value.
However, not against the most selling car in Czech - Fabia Combi's Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the new generation of the young-beloved product, then let's find that Peugeot takes care of a lot of known 52 litres.
On the allowed to the border or at the setting of the cocktail, this value is a critical value.
But if I had to exceed the position, I still have to mention the entire equation bottom after the slider of the second row or a very low job.
120 horses in four lines
Our tested car was built with a range fourth of 1,6 l with 88 kW.
And to say the truth, so she should look like a sixty-six-six-six-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt.
He's quiet, he's a little consumption, and he's in particular.
If I compare her with the scoody time that leckdy works as if she had to go out, I can only be overcome with her.
The price will be intended.
The car price is not human.
However, we have to remember that we tested a busy car with space interference and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the fourteenth of 329 900 Kč is still going.
Our aggregate stands from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
The tested equipment of Premium will then take the emission for the other 80 000 Kč board.
Only we had main airbags, automatic climates, auto-starting trainers, electric control of back windows...
It's just 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but get the additional equipment in Fabi and get a lot of similar numbers.
So she's not staying before you decide for the tag.
The integration of the Slovenian requests in the British schools is not happening
In the British schools, children from the Eastern European countries are achieved, and in local employees, they are concerned about further local development.
The integration of the East Europeans continues to reach a series of transactions.
The British schools still record the cases when the sports between accessors and the children of the original citizens are growing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe on British schools is well illustrated in the North Kentu, where they begin to address the sports between local users and Slovakia.
The smokes, the skins and the skins between the kitchens were also moved to relationships between parents.
The situation has come so far that in Chatham, the police has holded a dictionary woman who had a melted tits of a decade.
She's provinced that the boy's raised her to rasistic advice.
The police has also been able to hold two girls in the Slovakian advice after the attack.
Children participated in rasistic notes and housed on him stones.
"When we went home, a boy shocked up on the bus and started shopping on us.
When I told him to leave it, he burned on us the jabbles and the shoes, and then he broke up his shoes," she writed another uncomfortable accommodation for the Times' mother of the Sloven's requests.
The difficulties are out of both sides.
One of the local users has even marked sports from Eastern Europe for the combat of survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in the British schools between local and assistants is beginning to be written.
In the United Kingdom, 70 thousand Slovakians are registered here for work.
Thirty thousand Slovakian requests then visiting British schools.

And then the American error came.
The National Hotel has grown at the same end of 20 years.
He left him to set one of the American mafia Lucy Luciano, because all that was in the United States crime (in particular for prohibition) was welcomed and supported drugs, hazard, prostitution.
His hosts were mine.

In the bar of the beauty National hotel, you have a cocktail for your friends.
And the 50-year-old car goes after Havana, because sometimes imported eggs and kids in that smoke and smooth winds have been smoothed for a long time.
It's Havana, especially her oldest part, is extremely disappointed, but there's no longer so beautiful colonial memory, as well as there.
And other places are turned to a beautiful, like Trinidad.
While the travel moves take so much necessary money, its development is green.
For the past 15 years, new hotels were grown not only in Havana, but especially on Varader, at the border of Holguin and on the islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another library that is joined on the world and evaluates it, especially the chemical.
Thirty of the spread plants were switched into sugars after the smooth cows and motor hairs.
Their car park has not renewed many decades, so they are there to see the functioning machines that the tops are already in musics.
Where to go?
This is the most known place of Kuby's visitors.
And then about Warader, or about Havana, it's not enough to write.
It may only be a reminder that the Hemingway's use is a museum and whoever loves this writer should not leave a visit.
Viňales A village of Kuby's most smallest coats is the field of Viňales at the west of the island.
Build vegetation grows from the vapent base.
Mogoty, vampire homols and stones are raised up from the day of the field, and in their towns the ground was cut off, thanks to the wind scale covered by a huge port.
The field is a place where the most quality cuban tabak is grown.
With his final like you can meet, if you visit some of the Havanian manufacturers.
Maybe somebody's going to be interesting, and it's the chile part of Majora Zeman.
Trinidad
Ancient cities based on a long time after the Spanish colonization of the islands.
Honour and richness brought him to trade with slaves and sugar.
The divinity turned into the beauty of the great city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, highly affected by later French attendants, has not been changed at least for four hundreds.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Scambray, is a place so far that in the past 50th century there was no streets that the country would be with the rest of the country.
She has helped him stay.
There was nothing there, and so there was nothing to be broken, everybody liked to have a throat over his head.
If a man on Trinidad has more time than one afternoon, then they're going to look at it also at a interesting place in the nearby area, like Playa Ancon plane or Cucrovars.
Then the evening is to go to Casa de la Musica, who lives after meeting and music in it on the morning.
Baracoa
City on the same east of Kuby, some mark as the most beautiful on the island.
The experimental viewer has already influenced the path.
Both streets that lead from Guantánam have to convince high and high mountains and walk to the nature which the human activities has nearly not been notified.

But as it's right, better to see.

The number of violent actions has contributed to reduce the last year of 27 per cent, in the Southern Province of Helmand even 60 per cent.
The NATO land has 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, from the fourth horse in the South Territory.
According to the United States, the connections have obtained the same limits in the organization and equipment of units.
They are particularly requested for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the Treining of African Units.
"We'll really have to think about specific targets for the next time and ways to get them," said Gates.
In the same meaning, the General Secretary of NATO Jaap de Hoop also discussed today.
"I'm not happy of what we have in Afghanistan on the earth and in the air.
We have at least ninety percent of soldiers and exhaustions that we should need, and it's a little," said Agent Reuters De Hoop for the conclusion of classical conversations with Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
In the middle of the countries participated in the last months, there are also sports on whether all connections are in Afganistan’s maximum.
The passivity was criticized for example by Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of adjustments in Afghanistan.
But they are located in areas where the minimum violence and fighting proceedings are not as high as for us in the south and east part of the country," said Gates.
The British Bulgarian letter of Sun this week marked German soldiers for lenox.
"Afganian hosts are cut off: Germans play while we fight, "Sun wrote in the material, full of the pictures of German soldiers playing the tenis.
The German image moved to the contract and printed the dreams of the British units at the ragby safe in the southern part of Afghanistan.

For the whole lonely year, more than 111 billion corners were fulfilled.

The next year should be moved between 900 billion and a billion of corners, "with the iHNed server's analysis Patria Finance David Marek.
It also sees the Analytic Next Finance Vladimir Picora: "We could get one billion through 2009.
When it's exactly the next budget that we don't know yet.
If the situations in the political scene would be changed, the policy would wish to be more careful, it could be moved to 2010.
But I don't think this change," he said.
Depths growing
The State debt creates the duties of the central government and enhances particularly the summary of the country budget.

Better than waiting
From the financing strategy and administration of the State duty for 2007, the Government planned for a period of 159.2 billion corn.

The woman has to come to the court in Chartum today because she gave the name of the plysh medicine.
The British teacher, condemned in Sudan for Islam, was judged in the fourteenth evening of one chairman of Chartum, sent to the fifty-day prison, and was excused as she brought her lawyer.
The British was accused that she left six to seven years of cherry to give to the flash media name Mohamed, instead of any view of the prophet of Islam is denied.
She was punished by the crack.
This britical four-four-four-four-four-year-old teacher in the United States High School in the South Chartum was held in the week-of-see at home and was accused of islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Court, after a number of requests of parents had been held at the Sudan Ministry of School.
Our story begins in reality in September, when the tactical teacher requests its six-year-seven-year-old requests to choose the name of the classic medicine.
"The children's mouth has eight names, between them Hasan, Abdulah and Mohamed," says the director Robert Boulos.
After voting in the class, 20 of 23 children finally choose as the most favorable name of Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but in particular it is a very extensive baptism name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for their class with a photography, "My name is Mohamed."
He had no shield on himself with this name, because he was in the same view of the prophet considered as an islam’s assurance.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who learned in the same school in Southern, declared that he knows it well and that she would never do anything to be assured for any religious faith: "I'm sorry only that she asked children to vote for a name," is just according to him about "unbelievers."
This is the view of many teachers who describe it as "being careful to their requests" and adds that "he never speaks of religion in class."
Remember that the Christian name of Mohamed is also the second most partly made Christian name in the Great Britain, in English is written fourteen different ways.
This baptism name often chosen Muslim families represents how to worship the prophet (seely it is made to the firstborn).
However, what rules do the use of this baptism’s name?
Is it possible to give the player?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last row of this Centre in Vienna, they did not succeed to the agreement on the future state of the provincies.
Unfortunately.
The Albanians and the Cosbanes ended in the middle of the morning in the sixth and at the last round of talks, and they did not have been able to realize different views on the future state of this separat country.
"The policy is appropriate that both parties were not able to succeed to the status agreement," reported the European delegator Wolfgang Ischinger during the print conference in Vidni.
His American fighter, Frank Wisner, pointed out that peace in the area is "in the field" and appealed on the Belarehrad and the Pristina to maintain their obligations to maintain peace and to be ready for the dialogue.
"We don't wait for violence in the nearest time, but we're going into a real time," added, "it's evident that the situation is written."
Emission ends of 10 December
The Treaty Delegator based on the European Union, the United States and Russia will last be published to Kosova on Monday.
Provincies where 90 per cent of the Albanian Popular Population creates a clearer light to 10 per cent when Ischinger, Wisner and Russ Department Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko have to receive the United Nations Security Council their report.
The talks in Baden, at least Vienna, represent the sixth and at least the last round of exemption since the United Nations, in August this year, tricked a new exemption.
The Americans and the Europeans account that the discussions will be concluded on 10 December.
The Russians, who have been locked in the United Nations Security Council before, notably, continue to continue the operation as well as the most extremely established term.
"Russ was and remains closed to the solve, the compromissible solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A single statement of independence?
After eight years of international community management, the West considers the independence of Koss under EU monitoring for a single solution.
Pristina states that, if the Council is not resolved in its efforts, it is prepared for independence to speak single-side.
Beautiful garden remains on expanded autonomy.
"Good, we have not succeeded to any agreement," reported the President of the Cosovial Samoshistry Fatmir Sejdi in the study hotel, where this "union of the last chance."
Hashim Thacher, ancient raised officer of the Albancs and the future premisher of the provincies, expressed freedom.
However, he added that the autonomy plan represented by the Belarus "the past which led to murder and deport."
"Domain Effect"
In contrast, Serbian President Boris Tadić believes that the compromise still comes in consideration and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo before the results of the events of the independent independence of the provincies.
The beauty is particularly both the "domain effect" in the area that is still instable in the consequences of war for independentness in 90 years.
"But it doesn't mean it," said he, "the compromiss is impossible."
In the Serbian Delegation, it continued that all decisions were explicitly the Council of Security, where its Russian connection had the right of veta.
"The Common Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbsko is only acceptable solutions from the Security Council," reported the Serb Prime Minister Vojilav Kosztnik.
"This operation was two years.
He has to end as she started: to the Security Council."
The newspapers, Fatmir Sedji, replied that "the last word on state will have the Cosbane Parliament" and added that if a single statement of the independent statement from the Albanian citizens would be "on agreement" with the West.
Bush took the agreement on the Israelites and Palestinians
At the start of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland, the American President George Bush reported that the Israelites and Palestinians finally agreed to the common statement.
He suggested that the Israeli president Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to immediately start operation with a meaning to resolve a 60 years of remaining sport between both nations.
In the present case, both Bush had promised that he would do everything to help them to close the "Merge Agreement" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy the "theory infrastructure" and Israel must end with colonial activities, proclaimed Bush and reminded the obligations for both parties with the "thestic maps" to the peace adopted in 2003.
The Boss of the White House suggested that the treatment between Israel and Palestinian Samostrate Abbam has a goal for "the conclusion of the peace agreement that would resolve all the unresolved issues without exclusion, including the central question."
This announcement includes three questions in the nuclear area between the Israelites and Palestinians: future frontiers of Palestinian, the Jerusalem status and the Arab frontiers in conflict in 1948 from their homes in the country of Israel today.
Abbas asked the President of America and raised up the following action to be "excellent and valid" and to touch all the aspects of the solution, with that he mentioned "Jerusalem, surroundings, borders, colony, water, security, except others."
Then Olmert went out to the Court, who explained that the next issue should be "award and continental" and that it is necessary to "resolute to be concluded in 2008."
Bush decided in the end of 2008 as a term of implementation of his "see two States", Palestinian and Israel, existing near himself.
The Saudi Arabic suggested that from Bushem the commitment was taken in this meaning still before she decided to participate in the conference.
The Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is successful for Washington, initiated the proposal adopted by all Arab countries that Israel offer peace for the destruction of all Arab areas taken for war in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "the cross in the Middle East history, especially because he fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," judges Prince Saud in interview, which has provided an Arab speaker journal for the Saudi capital.
The police officers have no responsibility.
What happened exactly on the evening?
As this is always in such detailed reports from black cronics, official versions are not agreed with what is talking between people.
What are the circumstances?
According to the first inspection of the French police inspection (Inspection General de la Police, IGPN), the police car traveled for a week after 17 hours after the Road of Louise-Michel in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.

The test of alcohol in blood carried on the vehicle was negative.
The stage of the car (fresh predator, divorced front steel, rubbers) tests about the precision of the narrow.
Mary-Terèse de Givry was very quickly reacted to the Republic of Pontoise (Republic de Pontoise) and has already announced tomorrow that the IGPN had investigation of "increasing murders and non-profits to help people in battle", which are also directed by the Department of the Security Public Du Val-d'Oise (Director of the National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
In the event of the afternoon printing conference, the Procurator declared that the IGPN investigation exceeds, in this phase, the police responsibility for accident.
Three witnesses who had been detailed on weekly, according to the Office, confirmed "the police versions, because the mini-motor has just closed the left to them."
Some rings, uncertainly made a thirty clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles were locked up until the time the police car had been able to cut off.
The officer was insured and went to a technical expert.
Both of the victims were carried out yesterday.
What's going on, then?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, the people had quickly expanded the word that polices had to quickly leave the place of action, and they would not give to two young people the first assistance.
The IGPN had, in all care, also excluded "also serious offence" in this point.
"It's the most aspect of investigation that requires more advantages and with which it must be very careful," supported the police resource.
The Diary "Liberation" was meeting with the eyes witness of them a few hours that followed after accident.
One of his windows will lead to the right place where the accident has gone.
"Well we are together with a sister who is a healthy sister in the hospital, have gone down to try to resurrect them," says this witness.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he looked at the "Cucking, full of troubled police.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth talked to the phone."
The faces in the face of a quick growing inflation and the most sure that the situations of young people are unexpected, but polices have been taken to the colleagues who were attempt to the place.
According to the witness, the guard has arrived "20 minutes after the police's department."
They also brought the massage of the heart, but it's amazing.
"No one says that the police authorities have not helped young people.
These young people were offered to the first help.
The Hassiers came immediately.
For their savings, it was all done," the procurator was surprised.
Infections in Pakistan growth
Pakistan's police on the Sunday, the first demonstration from the declaration of the exceptional state of the General Musharaf, two days ago.
In the city of Lahor, on the east country, almost 2000 lawyers demonstrating the measures adopted in the framework of the exclusive state were destroyed by the branches of the smooth floor which, according to the witnesses, used the orders of forces.
The last names replied to the stone that they destroyed a few police.
At least 350 lawyers were invited.
The same scenarios like in Caracher and Rawalpind, where the police attacked and murdered the lawyers.
Some of them had to be called.
In Islambad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court were calling after the general stage and announced the demonstration, in consequences of five hundred detentions of the opponents, fighters for human rights and lawers during the week.

More than the third entirety still creates unexpected
This calculation shall include non-expected (24 %) as well as bad planned or unexpected.
More than one of three (36%) is still unexpected today, the French National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) is published by the State of Demographic Studies, forty years after accepting the law of Neuhirth, which has concluded anticonception in France.
This calculation shall include non-expected (24 %) as well as bad planned or unexpected.
Various anticonception methods, which are hormonal anticonceptions or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the unfortunateness, describes Ined.
However, the anticonception has only been allowed to be more "profit control", states and notes that the use of hormonal anticonception in women between 20 and 44 years has been achieved from 5 % in 1970 to 60 %.
Finally, eight years of ten is well planned today.
One of the five has even been calculated exactly for a month and if it is possible to be considered as the best year period for birthing of child.
Universal Universal Requirement
More than seven hours of work in the universe needed astronaut Scott Parazinski and his members of the International Universal Station (ISS) to the attention of an increasing solar panel required for further scientific activity.
It was about risk output into the universe which collected records at the length of the duration, distances from resident modules, speed with which it was scheduled and the "cultity" measures that the astronauts founded on the right.
The difficulty was found in a crash, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship made Harmony, a large military abus for the installation of European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see the framework).
This module is any contributing moles for the lab modules.
But you need to use electricity.
The second task was therefore to move the seventeenth-flowing module that produces electricity through the solary panels that have already been found on the ISS, so that it should be carried out on his final opinion.
After she moved her, she started launching seventy meters of the module solar panels.
And there was one of the panels based on as a tattoo harmony, the result of the packing steel, beated on the table without a meter.
The layout has been stopped to prevent the other range of the panel.
Astronautis who had originally had to carry out the control output on the Discovery ship, and then go to draw a different solitary panel which the road system had had to be able to take place to the exploited panel.
And it was just Scott Parazinski, who was chosen to fly at the end of the robot railed ship that came to the stairs, and he made a replacement.
It's one of the best "spacewalkers" (VIS) of the United States air and universe Office (NASA).
High, old, very refreshed, has a great group and a long hole.
In his 46 years, this original authorised doctor was convinced to "operal" "performed" solitary panel.
After detailed incidents, he broke a vacuum box and admitted to a ransom location like "shirts".
He helped him the second "spacewalker" who stayed close to the equipment comor, and also outside other astronauts, between them Peggy Witson, a major staff.
The narrows that he used, such as the minihokee, with a cloud isolation environment, to be protected by the electricity on solary panels that produce several hundred times, found and produced astronauts on the stainboard.
After the operation, Scott Parazinski was waiting until the panel was completely distributed and then synthetized his neighbors and returned to the interior of the station.
Last morning, the astronauts used a half-day relax before today when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return back to the middle, as they were planned.
EADS actions shall be able to ensure
The EADS Action is entirely lost in Paris, after this aeroplane and defense industry reported that it would have to lose 1,2 to 1,4 billion eur to fulfill the aeroplane A400M.
EADS has lost 4 % and now it is at Paris to 21,96 euros.
The Financial Group was intended to decide its proposed product results for 2007 in the consequence of a short-term procedure to buy the A400M air carrier, which is the condition of the airport.
The price for a reduction of the post in the additions of the military cost airport, published in October, was calculated "1.2 to 1,4 billion eur, from more than billion € for Airbus", announced the European EADS Institute.
For these costs, the EADS next fourth, in the presentation of its fourth-year results, it is necessary to notify a new view of the review before the receipt of measures and data (EBIT).
The group also suggested that the new cost costs correspond to the six monthly post.
Remember that the EADS production results in 2006 have fallen over 86 %, especially because of the costs associated with another programme, including A380 air condition.
The first additive of the A400M France Army was provided in October 2009.
Decision for the status of which
Inspection options are conducted without a drinking expectation: The Russian majority chooses the part of the President Putin, the United Russia.
By confirming that, after the end, a very little free pre-selectable campaign, their effort to stability, ba to the authority.
Today, three days before the elections to the messengers, the Russian President Vladimir Putin shares the volunteers on the public legal stages proposed by the television message, however the contents are held in secret.
Thus, from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the procremel parties, which, according to all, will be able to rejoice the third victory.
In the last time, when he accepted the majority of strangers, the President had nothing left him to get out of the appearance, and rejoiced with another attack on the west of his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of the right democracy, and we are honorable, that may be the most transparent and openest choices, choices without self-minder waves to be beautiful," added.
It doesn't beyond the eye.
They take the campaign recognised various pressures.
The Communist Leader of Gennadj Zjugannov says, "They have never done such choices or Jelcina."
After the repression of the demonstration of the past week, an elder master of the world in Garry Kasparov's chair, sent for five days to prison for unlawful demonstration, he has a further invitation to his advocates.
"Russ' mentality remains soviet human."
In the background of these parliament options of simple drinking expectations, two more open questions are profiled:
- "Who will be the Putin's advisor in the President Office?
The official letter has published the date of the first round of the President's elections, 2 March 2008; public candidates can be submitted to 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and renewed in 2004, can not be encouraged to the third mandate in order.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
I'll be a premium?
Or by the Leader of Parliament and the Universal Parties of Russia, who will choose the Government and President?
Let it be like that or the meaning that the Government of the Government will win the powers of all the parties in the Parliament, as well as in the President's choices.
It's tradition.
"Russians have remained mentality of society, they don't feel to be condemned of their condemnation," the socialist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The history of Nikolai Kopossov from the State University in Sanct-Peterburg is all of the remote consciences: the citizenship has taken, in this country, five-year-old-seconds after Europe, afterwards; it is a honourable common spirit to implement individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the nineteenth years, "Putin was invited to the patriarch model of State, completely accepted by the citizenship, but that this new fathernalism did not do the teror, but a certain economic gravity," refers Mary Lipman from Carnegie.
The Russians today are "personal responsibilities" which they have submitted shortly after the SSSR.
"Why do you think?"
This phenomenon is concerned with all society levels, including the trade world.
The official elite is also to maintain the status of which: 65 governors (a total number of 85 russian bodies) leads the local candidate of Russia.
New freedoms transmitted from West are often like in the nineteenth years, the synonym of the caos.
The public decrease gives the presence of stability.
In the name of the stability of Russia, Russians will not vote extremists.
Confidential Tamary Chief, fourty-fourth-year-old professors, "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why to change them?"
Increased Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential mode, the national archives from Bad Arolsen, which matches 17,5 million of victims of Hitler's mode, open publicity.
47 million archive documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) was at this time only available for the "humanitary" purpose, that means individually and namely, for the request of ancient victims or the right persons.
One of the ones assured by the archive managers - between Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open scientists and historicals in May.
In view of the ratification process of this Agreement to all States, the opening has been effective yesterday.
Civil information
The free access of historicals to Bad Arolsen allowed to investigate "including prisons, campaigns and health staff to work hardly," explains Reto Meistern, Director of these archives governed by the International Red Crisis Committee (Comite International de la Croix-roge, CICR).
At the last time, there were several countries, among them Germany, against accessing these published documents, because of the relevant opinion of certain information.
What is the proposal of homosexuality or mental posting of some of the deport victims.
The registry of the concentration camps or officers set up by Gestape were gathered together for a practical purpose to find the deported or decorated work of civil society, to bring them evidence of their internal to open their way of disagreement.
Moreover, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are occupied by tens of individual requests.
However, for the part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited offer.
"On these documents can't expect anything essentially new," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Antisemitism Berlin Technical University.

Currently, the bilateral trade between Europe and India has already achieved 60 billion billion eur per year.
The EU is in the order of the first trade partner of India and represents 18 % of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India wait for the signing of the free trade contract in 2008, reported the European Commissioner for Peter Mandelson and his Indian Prosecutor Kamal Nath.

The English bank took the knowledge of fears and offered 10 billion libs in five-year-day auction
The English Bank in the fourth day showed that it would be intended to reduce the current fear of the renewing conditions on the level market and published the offer of 10 billion library in the fifty-day augurs for the basis rate of 5,75 %, which is usually increasingly long.
"In order to prevent fears, in accordance with which the conditions on financial markets will be very unreasonable in the end of the year and give to the banks a greater security in order to ensure its preparation position for this period, the Bank will intend to offer a significant part of its planned resources during the maintainment period, which begins on 6 December, in the form of fifty-day operation on the open market," she cried in the community.
The Bank claims that 10 billion library (14 billion eur) will be placed on the financial market of 12,15 GMT to 10 January, for the basis of the rate.
It seems to be the first thing that BOE pumps on the financial market ready in five weeks operating on the open market.
It's normally a week.
The BOE adds in its communication that "he is prepared to carry out further measures to maintain the rate rates" between banks at the same level with its basic sample.
The Middle Bank Interbanc rate rate was in the middle of 5,829 %.
Third monthly rate rate was set at 6,6 %, which is the highest number from 18 September.
From the beginning of the annual financial crisis, the sums were located on the financial market of the English Bank linked to the plant samples that the banks were distributed from the use of this offer.
According to certain specializations, the European Central Bank with lower samples and more discriminations have been decided for the sums on the financial market of the European Central Bank.
UMP (the Union for a popular movement, the Union for human forces) and the NC (New Centre, the New Centre) refuses to address the proposals of socialists (PS) on cooking
The UMP and the New Centre have rejected the discussion on the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal of the law on competence, which is equal to the text.
On the agenda, the proposal of the law had received in the framework of the socialist 's 'initiated' (initiated by a single shipmate club) and contained the tenth measures adopted in the outside presidency of the PS, including 50 % of the employment pressure, the refrigeration of the TIP, transport shoes or regulation.
While UMP and NC voted against the introduction of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was concluded after the general examination, which had been the opportunity to consider, sometimes lived, among largest and opposite, a few hours before the television issue of Nicolase Sarkozy.
Boss of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will repeat these proposals in their fulfillment in the form of additions to the amendment proposal for the amendment of the financial law, which will make Snimovna for the next week.
Family is a new festival
Following a lot of speculation that C3 Presents in Philadelphia based a new festival, this promotor/productor Vinneland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the British Republic Festival of Melvin Benna.
"For our company, it is honour to work with a person who has inspired the current festival smoking in America," spoke Charlie Jones from the C3 server Billboard.com.
C3 Production of the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is an aircraft target.
The festival should go from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The Festival Director of the Republic, first known as Mean Fiddler, one of the most famous officers of the world.
In 1989, Reading Festival fell in the United Kingdom, which quotes for 800,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his Portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Festival founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
In the beginning of 2002, Melvin Benn, as a partner, also on the care of production, licence and organizational tasks on Glastonbury Festival, which has capacity to 177 500 people today.
Charlie Jones from C3 marks Glastonbury as a "the most inspired event" which has been inspired and says that his company and Melvina Benna work together in order to give the region the festival event of the European style.
"We originally chose the Philadelphia market and with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked strongly to make a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I went with the city, and the Commission was motivated and exceeded from the project.
However, we were disappointed because of the current leadership of the city, he adds Charlie Jones.
"Laughter, we had the opportunity to discuss Melvin Benn and to make a great festival on a special place that will last serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents, in 2005, resurrected the festival of Lollapalooza in the Czech Grant Park, after the festival scene was raised by Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Both markets for 2007 were 9,8M$ and 11,3M$.
These two festivals are in the city environment.
"The European festival model Melvin Benna is gone outside, while our festivals run almost on green prostrations in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to build both in a certain way of eating so that we create as a foreign festival after Europe, a city after America."
Vineland is located in half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, including old, supports the event of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last named refuses to consider the conditions of the agreement, however, says, "the fact that they are sufficiently efficient to invest in such events and to guarantee the festival that will have, hope, long-term."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "except high", like Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which takes 800,000 people.
It says that groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can be confirmed in the moment when the program is first given to the pressure.
"Vineland's gonna have rock woods, but the music's gonna be a damn thing that we might be attached to a large spectrum of divines," says Carlie Jones.
Partners of C3, which received the price of Top Independent Promoter in the last year Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal of the Terminator
It's not easy to attach Hollywood film study to Montreal when the Terminator is set against it...
This survey mission is one of the delegated tasks.
However, his mandate is "politically natural" because the Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger describes "increasing productions".
Is it hard to fall to the guarantee?
"It must be careful, it's a industrie who decides where it's going.
If he looks at the conditions in Montreal, he's going to go there.
Our task is to offer those they will consider as the best," he said.
Honba for festivals
For this time, however, Denise Turcottea's propagation of the local film is priority.
She's already started a honba for Oscar.
At all the west season festivals, to be one of the festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattlu or San Francisco, will be able to imagine chequebeck films, to warn them and to ensure that the registers provide conversations.
The growth of the darkness had a few weeks ago a good publication on the 30th year of Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, the Palm Springs International Festival will be presented.
Shake hands with the Devil is in the offer in Santa Monica and will be presented on November 30, Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month also Quebec presented four short-quarters and four worldwide films on the American Film Institute Festival.
Is it the end of the year at the sky to maraton? Experty divided 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain at the end of the year of the administration and investors have already been looking for me in waiting for the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
However, the experts are not so sure they're going to go to him.
Bank Banif believes that "the statistical view has a month in the bottom of positive process."
However, it is not appropriate to create proposals explicitly based on statistics, especially because of the current market-related, at least the short-coding, certain doubts."
These experts don't think that the burdens in the past weeks of the year are disappeared, and that "the burden market is maintained by the existence of liquidity prepared to invest in regard to the failure alternative, especially to the effective effect of the impact of quality prices, as long as in short-term rates."
It is therefore considered that the burden will have nearly quiet progress without volatility, "forwardly because it doesn't know the probable effect of the FED's saze (Federal Reserve System), with regard to the high level of the price and the risks of the inflation buttons."
Javier Barrio, leadership of BPI banks in Spain, agrees that it's not the right moment for the debt statement that it's going to maraton.
"No reasons for joy," ensures the expert.
Ibex lost at least 4% of the maximum values referred to in November 8, when the index was held at 15 945,7 points.
However, all experts do not have such negative views.
Juan Solana, Intermoney Analytic, is considered that Ibex 35 could end a year about about 16,000 points by purchasing portal and traditional investments on the pension connection that will be achieved each year.
However, this expert indicates that the amounts will be a little different, because it is considered that the maraton will come before, in the second prosinc week after a long-term week at the opportunity of the Day Station.
The indicated analysis does not believe that the volatile influenced the market management.
Federico Olucha, an analysis of Inversis Banco, also describes that we are close to the technical level and "with so we can watch the index that was chosen from the United States reports about the consequences of crisis on a level market."
Analytics believe that these results will be positive.
Analytics agree in the selection of titles that are required to bring Ibex to new maximum costs.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "years are a number of strong titles."
This expert would gather both large banks and some structure companies, "as when this time comes, the energy exploitation will be very nice."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco ensures that the growth of the growth will go into the hands of banking and industry sector.
Stave companies will also be able to protect if it comes to it.
"ACS's got a few months ago, and we hope that there are more structure companies such as Ferroval and FCC will go to the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption shall be used in the last part of the year in the previous year, thanks to the increase of the sales in the vaccination period.
This expert on the other side believes that technologies will be very well, even though in this field are not too attached to the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, there was only two cases of the events.
The real maraton at the end of the year was in 2003, in the administrative year, when the bourse markets had finished the crisis called by the exploitation of the technological bubbles.
Years when Ibex 35 reached 28,17%, the prosecution signed the increase of 6,68%.
We will also see whether the year 2007 will be in the fifth trip year (as Ibex has increased 8,36% since January) and if he will have his maraton at the end of the year.
Two hundred people banks will be opened 12 hours from five to the Sunday
The Popular Bank decided to modernize most of its fields.
The total of two hundreds located in the most business parts of Spain.
These pockets under the Popular Max Market are a big change for bank.
In addition to other Spanish companies, it is the first group that decided to make such a step and to fix the unexpected opening time to 20.30 hours and to open on the Sabbath from 10 to 30 hours.
BBVA, another group, which also ensures that he wants to long the opening time of his floor, has not yet decided to this step.
It is appropriate to conclude the agreement with the Affairs on the opening period of 75 % of its shipment in the Sabbath for the expiration of the opening period for a week-end, even if not for publicity.
The results of this experiencing of the Popular Bank will be decided to be attached or not to any other items to this initiative, which supports the opening period of trade.
That's exactly the target of the project that the Popular Bank has taken out.
Get individual customers who are delivered in these places after their buying, smaller and central company, food and businesses from the selected streets where they are going to open the ship.
The Bank wants to open 200 these fields in all Spanish for about 18 months, because it is not easy to open new fields, but only for the process of already existing.
That is why the bank modernizes the railways already in trade areas by applying the profile of customers in separate streets.
This is the length of the opening time, which is fulfilled by the other movement of the area and the new, current design in the lighter colors.
The Banking Director of Angel River ensures that this restructuring does not mean a large investment, but the majority of the personnel, since six employees on the field at eight to nine.
The pockets will even be built spaces for the meeting of small and central firms and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three madrid pools.
And it was a positive experience how Angel River explains.
They were chosen in the Madrid Street Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via and, according to River, it seems that it was a happy choice.
The Popular Bank has 2 500 ships in the present time.
And the other 60 specialized on the immigrants, which are conducted under the Market of Mundocredit, has also been very long opening time and was opened even in the week and on the feasts.
PopularMax pools will not follow the BBVA model when the series of her seeds offer to sell a large non-financial product scene.
"We don't want to concurr to our clients," says River.
They just agreed with the telephone to sale cells throughout the external personnel.
The telecynico first on the sky doubled the value of your Anteny Rival 3
We did it.
In this time Paul Vasile, executive President Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction in the negotiation concluding that the television that he leads has double-limited the value of his Rival Antena 3.
Only one thing said to his joy, "What I'm sorry, is that it's not because we're growing more, but because we've been lowerly we've been talking about."
And then he showed that thanks to the weak market, we're wearing less.
The telecynico has been completed by 2,54 %.
This risk has raised their loss as a total part of the year to 15,66 %.
The currency value of this Mediterranean (s 52% of the capital) for Vocent (13% more), as follows Bloomberg data, is achieved by 4 488,88 €.
Her concurrent Antena 3 that yesterday claimed about 1,52 % and from January totally decreased 40,5 %, has a half value 2 193,46 million.
The value of the other telecommunication firms assessed is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (provider Cinco Days) and 1,779 billion Vocent.
According to Vasile comparison with Antena 3 is offered, because we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do on the same market, for what price and how we assess it.
The telecynico announced that the years were counted by convincing billions of severe accommodations from the reklame was the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, executive President Telecinco and Publispania, the pools that ensures the reklame of the group.
If the data was actually targeted, this television channel would notify the growth of an annual reputation of 3,6 % of 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the pure reputation of Anteny 3 to 1,6 % (and increased as 734,4 million), while the pure accommodation of the TV increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors on which analysis is measured, for the best related development of Telecinco on the built is a higher pay out that continued to keep: in 2006, this company divided by President Alexander Echevary, between its actors of 100 % of their skin.
Vasile ensures that even if it is a decision soon, this coefficient could be changed after purchasing 33% of the Endemol company together with his maternal mediaset company.
"We have official obligations to give at least 50%, although we've always spoken more.
I hope we'll be able to satisfy our operators, which we have already increased 33% of Endemol.
According to the market analysis in these moments, there is a certain delay.
Lehman Brothers recently decreased its remedies from Telecino, and it was 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
That is why they explain that the preliminary growth of tax increased from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
This company reduced the preliminary risk of Anteny 3, and it was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 Considerations
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends to purchase both titles in particular based on the increased rate of distribution and long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: it values the best Telecinco (hromadit) than Anten 3 (manage) because of its 'reading presence' and the growth of trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, recommends not to prevent them, for the "like threat" (the prejudiced market and the sustained economic environment).
The Congress approved the MiFID transposition valid from 1 November
In accordance with Parliament's commitments, which have been concluded by the voting of the Congress on the news sentence to the proposal of the law, the Government declared the public hearing of the new law to both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties have encouraging the efforts of messengers and senators to earlier and to ensure the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the companies necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which amends the Law on Trade with Price Paper, provides modernization of financial markets and strengthens the protection of the investors, improves the monitoring of the State Commission for the market with the price paper (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual monitoring authorities of the European Union.
This new provision is allowed to provide financial advice services as specialised companies, such as physical or legal persons, and creates a new type of funding for financial services (ESIS), the financial Council company (AFI), which are linked to the company with the price paper, the median office with price papers and the company of the portfolia.
Furthermore, the number of systems for operations with financial instruments are extended to the regulated secondary markets to multi-second trade systems and the interpolation systems of commands that will concurr to the current builders.
The Law continues to ensure investment services to extend information on the market on the key aspects of their trade profile, the establishment of risks and methods of equipment with risk and requires the list of all operations carried out in order to review monitoring from the CNMV page.
During the implementation of the Congress Committee, there were a number of amendments under which the securitized reviews were considered as a "based" financial instrument in view of high dangers for investors, which was provided for in the United States with high risks of hypothesis (subprise).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used for a legislative exemption of functions that can remain in the Economic Affairs and the management of the undertaking of 30 years after that the king's decree was approved in 1977.
The Senate also established a new profession in the financial sector, such as a mediator who will work externally, will not require authorisation from CNMV and will be able to provide business services with products and to get clients for various investment companys.
The harmonised ISC has increased in November 5 decades to 4,1 %.
This indicator, which later serves the Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides forward information on how the prices were increased in Spain in November.
His publication is responsible for the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable with those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated for the use of the same process used for harmonised consumer prices, but for the use of various statistical modelling methods for information that are not yet available during publication.
The Spanish INE (State for Statistics) reminded that the information provided for this pre-presentative indicator is only oriental, and therefore it is not necessary to agree with the final data that are entered in the knowledge of 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to keep on relatively high levels."
The second officer of the Government and Economic Ministry Peter Solbes declared that the ISC-4.1% is a "time number", but he also proposed that the price index will be in the next months and further on the relatively high level.
In each case, Solbes in the Congress clubs declared that "and if it's not a positive number," the Spanish inflation difference for the mining Union is still the same in the last two years.

Climate Propaganda
In view of the disagreement against climate changes, the inadequate consequences such as those who seekly look at its proposals, as well as those who give the presence to other political and social wars, must be demonstrated a firm consistently.
Moreover, the leader of a challenge that is the President of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this war is more important than the fight against the Islamic Territory, and it is still agreed to sign the "new Treaty with the planet".
This proposal would declare him why the activities or the activities of his governments had significant measures to contribute to Spain to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Whoever is responsible for this unfulfillment in which it happens and why his government, the Government of the Treaty, has not been protected.

The companies will be surprised that the reviews of citizens must be changed, how energically, individual and collective, we must accept and how it will have economic consequences.
Other words who sacrifice and pay for the safeguard of the planet.
But we haven't waited for such explanations, and we don't wait.
It's just because they need to sacrifice and pay.
The measures against climate changes, real measures are not polluted.
Dear, inadequate and worried businesses and private accounts.
Even one center of benzine price proposed by PSOE (Spanish Socialist Side), Sapater had so risked from the view of the choice that he had been able to refuse it.
Other words, it's about to save the planet so that it's nothing, clean propagand, passwords to any real meaning.
Furthermore, Commissions, Committees, Protocols and new positions.
And the covenant with the planet; this lord is so useful for the election campaign that doesn't speak, and doesn't require anything, but it's a mixture of milks, and he raises it up.
If it's limited to be just a virtual side of contracts, and it does not want us to walk on the road and beat in prison.

One colleague reports on the introduction of a criminal transfer from the Internet to the Criminal Act:
A. The loading of one song would have been a criminal act from six months to one year.
Instead, if you fall into the board area in the price less than 400 euros, it is considered to be a single transition (§ 623.1).
B. If you decline to 1 000 euros in the field, it is already a criminal act, but the criminal rate is less than downloading (§ 234 of the Criminal Act).
C. If you shoot the car and return it for 40 hours, the criminal sax is still lower than downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less important to participate with the packaging changes.
Participation of the expensiveness has a rate from three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Act) and the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years

My medicine's investigator takes me one of his articles on specific researchs with the name "Penise makes the brain activation, especially if others get less."
Even if the feelings that calls a month payment for employees are concerned about how many colleagues do.
The study was made at the Bonn University through magnetical resonances on the tomograph and the results were published in the last number of Science magazine.
According to Bernda Weber, the writer of the study and leadership View Neurocognition of Life &Brain in Germany: "Increasingly, when the participant of the research reacted correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Research workers noted that if both were successful, they received the same payment, the activity was low, but when one received a double-size, the activity was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required a lot of sciences.
Balkan Slave
Carla del Ponte has eight years of disease from the State Procurture of the Court of Justice in Haag crime from the Balkan war.
Her mandate is the end of the year, and Carla will go away with the humble feelings, because the main victory of maskers in Srebrenici, where 8,000 gods Muslims have lost, the former general Rasko Mladicz and the former leader of the Boss Serbs of Radovan Karadjič, are still on freedom.
Their names are on the list of the name of the documentary film of the Swiss Register Marcela Schubbacha "List of Karlin" (2006, in Spain, not delivered) whose time of detective trillion seeks from Belarus to New York the Switzerland's work at the prosecution of several crimes and the throat on the competent States to take a network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
A vehicle ensure that the driver protects in the case of non-condition. It represents a significant expenditure that relates to various factors such as age, status, head, length of control of the driver, the type of vehicle to check or use its aphod.
It's just the start of the car.
Choosing a suitable car check is even more difficult than selecting the car model.
First, we need to explain what we're talking about.
The vehicle ensure is an agreement between the security and the ensure.
This commitment takes into account a form of ensure agreement that determines that the ensure shall be achieved in a certain higher exceeding that it takes placen smoking in the case of a certain event.
The price of ensure that is determined in view of various factors such as age, status, head, length of the driver test, the type of vehicles that are ensuring or use of the aphod.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the most likely is that it is possible to go to havaria, it is higher safe.
For this reason, as age 25, women must pay lowly, because statistics show that they have lower risk index in respect of their care.
In the same way, on the basis of control, the ensuring company has been concluded that persons who live in marriage have less hazard than the free leaders.
The procedure which the vehicle is used will have an impact on the ship lead, and the possibility that there will be a problem.
The majority of the reading of the ship is higher the probability.
There are many variables that consider insurance when they set the price of a certain price.
Therefore, the manager must be well studying the situation to choose the ensure that he is best responsible for his ensure profile.
We'll show the most important variable here for the choice of the type of ensure that other than the type of ensure is also a understanding price.
The younger than fifty years are meeting with various disagreements as a few experiences with management and short delay of the guideline test when they want to join a certain price.
Although the ideal for good crisis is ensure against all risks, there are also less variables.
The non-joupatrian drivers can choose ensure against all risks with a lot of confidence to achieve the safety criteria of all risks, but for the more acceptable price.
This type of contract would provide a participation of the client at the front of a certain event.
"The part of the fields of a certain event that will be provided by the client will be determined at the determination of the price of a safe price that will be higher than it would be co-related," explains Luis Noguera, the main Leadership of First Europe in Spain, a security center on the Internet.
Another opportunity is to ensure that other participants are expanded so that the client will be assured against the shooters of other persons, but not against the shooters of his own car.
Moreover, it would be confirmed against the railway, the fire and the loss of the vehicle.
Reporting.
If you're younger twenty-five years, try to be careful and decline the hazard as it's possible, because it's the influence of your bonus and allows you to reduce the safe in the future.
Bonus is the reduction of the basic assessment of the company.
Instead, small is the increase of the basic saxy.
"Bonus and a little will be able to make sure it and her skin.
If she had a good year, it'd be able to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After overriding the border of twenty-five years, the leaders have more easier when they are going to meet the assessment, because the client's risk index is reduced to them, thanks to the supply experience.
It is therefore the most recommended to concert against all risks.
"Young people are usually not able to use before the experiences obtained in the second year when it comes to Hawaii and not on the management," ensures the Director of the European Community in Spain, and adds that the majority of the hawaries exists in the second year of management when it is already concluded "the crack of news".
However, if the client is married, but there is still no children, it is better to meet confidence against all risks, however, if it allows his economic situation.
Family with children are convinced as a client with the less risk index and then their adjustments will be less.
In this case, the best ensure is to be ensuring against all risks insurable (which could make 300 €) or at high level, the ensuring extended to other operators begins in third year from the buying of the vehicle.
"Their management is quiet and their skills are higher, so they can allow the surfaces to get the highest snow here," advised Luis Noguera.
Reporters shall be recommended to ensure against all risks with an insurance (with 150 euros) or to ensure extended to other operating participants, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is necessary to say that the automobile ensure is so important not only because the protection of the driver in the case of the aircraft, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a reason for the appropriate training of ensure that it would be most important for us in respect of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get AC Milan point, which means eight-final
AC Milan and Celtic meet their powers to the Studio of San Siro at trying to get a point that they miss their relevant goals in the end of the "Champions", because it would be for Italy to be the first and the Scoots would have decided about the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already ensure the progress in the fifth restrictions in Portuguese, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to be sure that Shachčor will not have six points before him, which will play with Benfika, which has four.
These two challenges of group D will be played weekly before the end of the sixth round, since AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinent field in Japan, where the first one is in the thirteenth in the seminar, in order to go to the final which is played in the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before others and independent results on the station of Giuseppe Meazzy seems to be the most probable, even though both men are trying to escape of winning, because Italians will not want to tactize the household south and Celtic know that it would be the first and would be the best place in the eight-final.
The Gordon Strachan's husband could even be able to proceed, if Shachčor doesn't win, but it can't be achieved, because in the same number of nine points, Ukraine who have played last week in Glasgow (22:1), but they played in the first direct excuse (2:0).
And so AC Milan players try to shoot the night to Scoot, who believe that the second will be achieved in the reorganized Champions League as they were struck in the same challenge in the last challenge of Kaka in the long-term state (1:0) after the status of 0:0 in the basic player.
Hope that they won "rossoneri" will be Shachčor, for which he has the price of winning, only if Celtic had lost, and how to go to the eight-final progress, as well as for the EUFA meeting.
Benfif, although it is the last and does not have the possibility to continue in the highest European Court, could be gained by a third place, so it would play in the EUFA.

And I thought why not, so I liked that I decided," said Chisholm about the re-connexion group that she solved for nine years ago.
The song also recognised that the time procedure was "and we're all very happy."

New challenges on the floor between Russia and Ukraine
In the middle of Russia and Ukraine, there is just a sport on the price of the earthquake, so it increases the risk of that Russian additives can be affected in the western Europe.
Most of the Russian balls exported into the European Union (EU) are carried out by Ukraine and any sport between these two countries is observed.
Kyjev warned that if Moscow takes Ukraine the price of the floor, Russia will account the higher tranzit rate.
The previous sports between these two last year have reduced advantages to the EU States.
The most recent sport between Kyev and Moscow is coming at the moment when the Ukrainian government and the Russian State is owned by the Monopol Monopol, Gazprom, trys to agree how much Ukraine will pay for Russian floor in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine has to account more, because he agreed with a payment to 50% more than a floor from the neighbor Turkmenist.
Analysts say that it could mean that Ukraine should pay 40% more for their additions from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most significant training states in the process of treatment," said Agent Reuters, the Ukrainian Economic Minister of Anatolii Kinach.
"The changes in the price of the price should be unfortunately linked to our arguments relating to the highest tranzit proposals (in West Europe) through Ukraine."
The last larger sport between Moscow and Kyjevem made a reduction of the additives from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has caused several exports to the West Europe, which has increased the prices immediately.
The Russian floor represents one quarter additive to the European Union.
Russia has the largest grounds of the world, but the largest part of them remains unusingly.
According to Gazprom, its own advantages from Turkmenistan and other old Soviet Republic.
NHS must control the inner employment
The controller said that the NHS Scope comor should improve the control of criminal records in the foreign European employees.
The report from the President of the Highest Control Authority of Robert Black came after the foreign doctor in Scotland was attached to red attacks on the Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also afraid that the NHS Scope does not have a exact presentation on the number of the inner persons that works.
However, his report revealed that other key controls have been incorrect in the form of five health offices.
The President of the Highest Control Authority was directly interested on the June Affairs on the Glasgow Airport on a personnel received from the country outside the European Economic space.
Eight-year-old-year-old Bilal Abdullah, Iraqal doctor in Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the air after someone found Jeep in the door of the main terminal.
It was one of the three doctors who appeared in the Central Court of Criminal Court with a videomode was accused of a connection to trying bomb attacks in the Great Britain.
Since the NHS Commander is expected to control the foreign personnel in the view of qualification, experience and authorisation of work in the Great Britain before his employment.
Although the Scozia Health Commission uses the Discosure Scotland to control criminal records, this Agency has no authority to get such information outside the British.
The report of the President of the Highest Control Authority says, except other recommendations, that the Commission should be allowed to carry out the Directives of Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with control in several countries.
"Now we discovered that part of the personal records contained evidence of these controls, they are not regularly implemented," she reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scope NHS agrees with its own employment policy, but also added: "Our report warns the areas where the system could be improved to ensure the accessibility of adequate information on the loan of the foreign personnel."
The President of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was very uncertain, that the proposed controls would identify the potential NHS business that would be in the future to start terrorism.
"The report indicates that the current employment controls in the Scope NHS work well and not clearly what other value these comments will be taken," said.
The Scotland Health Offices reported that at the moment there are 1 161 foreign workers, from which large majority are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the Highest Control Agency noted that these numbers would probably be higher because the Commission had to have a problem to identify the person with the authorisation of residence.
The investigation also discovered that the NHS control procedures in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are achieved.
The controls of passengers, work authorisations and qualifications.
The Scotland Government currently transforms the policy and directives for NHS foreign workers.
The Ministry of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to make this work directly after a terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scotland Government in accordance with the Health Commissions apply the recommendation of this report and ensures that the best procedures may be shown in the updated directives of the proposed employment control of all personals, including the border, which plans to provide the next month.

Climates on Venus may be viewed by the future of the earth
The scientists announced that Venus had ever been a pleasant place for life.
The data of the European Station shows that the planet is more similar to its own duplex of the earth than it had thought before.
Venus is the nearest planetary seed of the Earth.
These two worlds are the same storm, and they are in the same way, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Now scientists believe that billions of years ago were on Venus’s conditions like those on Earth and could also be resident.
But the flashed steel effect caused by oxyd of carbon, atmospheric disease soldier radiation and low speed of steel sent Venus after full other development paths.
Today it's a planet without water, the temperature on the ground is too horrible on the oil tangent and the winds of the hurricane power.
Naaleses from the European Cosmical Agency Venus Express, who studied the planet for a year, provides a serious view to how the earth could be issued in case of catastrophical changes of climate.
Professor Fred Taylor from the physical category of Oxford University and one of the leaders of Venus Express said: "It's more clear why the climate is on Venus as far as on Earth, even though the planets are very different.
"Our new data are allowed to establish a scenario in which Venus has started as the earth, maybe with a population, billion years ago."

Continue to be carried out
Mitt Romney said that for the President's candidate, it's not sufficient to answer questions from the snow.
In addition, the Republican President candidates agreed with a debatte on YouTube, where the officers played their questions on the video and delivered them to the candidates.
No questions sent in the middle of November 28 was not so complicated as a snippet who asked the democracies to explore globally in the second side on YouTube.
However, the questions and the answers of this time have revealed many of the State of the Republic of the parties that are directed to the elections in the next year.
It is not clear how exactly the CNN producer, one of the debates sponsors, have chosen clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour debate, the greatest time has been held to the only threat, was measured for advancement.
This is one of the most strongest republished theme.
CNN requested the panel of unresoluted volators to turn the cat once when they heard something comforting: the speaker signed the top of the agreement when they were candidated to talk about a severe access to the borders.
To the most important and largest exchange of views, there was a rudy Giulianti, the main continent candidate, and Mr. Romney, who was stealing forward in the key vows in Iowa and New Hampshir.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to meet the news of a person who was as a premater of New York a mixer on an illegal advice.
He urged Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, that he had an illegal immigrant to work on his house.
These two were particularly urgent when the tasators asked whether some of the candidates would support "amnestyi" (giving illegal immigrants the normal position and the possibility of residence).
More candidates, like Duncan Hunter, the California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, congressman from Colorada, were able to get their little to the mill on this subject.
No one of these two has no opportunity to nominate, but both remain in the game easy to be afraid for the immigration before and stronger than the others.
At least on the adventure, candidats have the same opinion: the greater presence of the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with the fears of China's eating games and other concerns with the environmental world, helps republicans forget or minimize the divorce between Liberty and Christian Conservatives.
But the debat began to be very amazing when it came to other subjects.
Mr. Giuliani was investigated why he supported the shooting of guns in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated technology should be considered to be punished.
One tax collector asked whether candidats believe in each Bible words.
Through this, Mr. Giuliani concluded that even though the Bible is his favorite book, they may not believe a perfect story about Jonah and the Great.
Another tax collector asked whether Jesus would support death’s punishment.
Mike Huckabee - which is now against all the proposals on the first place in the recent investigation in Iowa thanks to his long - Christian concert - said that death suffering is inadequate but necessary.
Under the pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too wise to conceal what he had served by the counsels.
Soboy remains unexpectedly open.
Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is hidden with recent successs when you get money and a loud joy of Rona Paul in the middle-debatte.
These two fell from days, because both sides are still unable to agree on the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates agreed to the parties very soon and convinced with the victory report on the American size on the roads, murdered on both sides.
This time the page is distributed, and the results have a lot of unity.
Works of Labourists
Gordon Brown again found a past to fall; his path remains the same.
Although it's normal in the British political scenarios, this is not particularly pigant.
It doesn't seem to be sold any rows, no accounts in Paris hotel have been paid, no strange branches have been obtained.
But the ransom Gordon Brown would be obvious that some rich businessman after four years was masked by the Labour Government of the Labour's side in the highest 650,000 libs (1,3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the page did not be published.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister exceeded the election and shot the British intelligence with the statement that this decision was not affected by the investigation, there was a hope that he would ensure a separate and effective government.
Instead of how it has formulated the more amazing president of Liberal Democratics, Mr Brown has changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unreserved safeguard of the problem banks of Northern Rock showed slambines in the management and the chair under the hair.
The misunderstanding proposals on the change of the payment law have made the companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data for 25 million people has disappeared unpresentable administrative violence.
Three generals in the east started the refuge in the mind of the Lords; they protested against the army soldiers, because they stated that being the leader of armed forces was a party commitment.
Now there are multiple gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secret of the labourists (and their former internal disciple), has already been replaced.
Nothing of that means that Mr. Brown would not turn back to his end.
In addition, governments can achieve the point of surrounding that they look for the rule of severe.
People don't believe politics and don't like them, but most of their untrusted unfaithfulness when we transfer new parts.
When it seems clear that some premier probably doesn't have to be able to be long in the office, this is a department: the State administration becomes a wealth, the Ministers will begin to do the briefing, searching for bad messages, and government becomes uncentrified and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly comprehensive, because it cannot take the position of the new cost of other political leaders.
Even though he would like to be distant from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial office records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though it was not directly implemented in the Blair-Blair, such as a long investigation of the political parties' financing of the "values for money", the electorers may be quietly advised that it was.
But they don't hate Mr. Brown as bad as they look.
They're not so grateful as the concerts are doing.
What's about Mr. Bean, nobody died and wasn't covered.
And the treatment, as it can be painful, is to provide what Mr. Brown has always promised: a comfortable, solid and low brutal government.
The most recent discovery about political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboids, who compares his gifts with charity, says that he didn't enjoin any publicity for his goodness.
It may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymity of great political donors are clear and are of a simple reason: publicity has the right to know who could buy access to those governing the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he knew about Mr. Abraham's procedure, but he didn't know that it was illegal, would certainly be heard explicitly; as well as Jon Mendlesoh, the main labour cycle of money that was learned about the weak gifts in October.
But then, Mr. Brown wasn't locked anywhere; it's nothing that he would mean that he knew about these plastics, even when the main part of the payment passed up until his injury in June.
The Primeer did the half of the work.
This was very quickly condemnation of the laws of its own side, but he considered its decision on the basis of a testing tool, the Commission for the investigation of this matter, and also led by the biscub in the court and the judge.
In this case, they are not intended.
If the law was disappeared, it's about the police's business.
Furthermore, there are more things that Mr Brown should do, for example, to find a permanent Chairman on Standards in Public Life, which has no six months, and to address the real reform of the political parties.
This would be required by the labourists who are in the surprise to cooperate with the concerts and may also have their special financial relationship with the department - a large pillars for the given page as Mr. Brown.
But it should be a few simple facts.
Concernings now have a nice rate in research; he has two years to get back the balls; and the only way to gain winning is an unexpectable integrity and high competence.
Caret shirts
Is it affecting the crisis of the underground hypothesis of the American credit card market?
When it's in the water of blood, naturally, they're starting to have a smoke flower.
When the US market is now crucial, the predators have focused on the secret market of credit carts.
Goldman Sachs' Analytics say that the losses of credit cards, if from the underlying hypothesis, could have been 99 billion dollars.
The remarks are clear.
The increased number of cases of inability to pay (for more than 30 days of payment) and the rejected accounts (amounts that the provider considers as unexpectable).
The HSBC bank announced that the US credits have lost $1.4 billion on the market of consumer credits, also because of unsolventing credit cards.
But she's on the panic soon.
Received accounts and unability to spend is still fewer.
According to Moody's assessment Agency, 3,89% of payment insufficiency was at least at least the total percentage point under average.
The worst peace is given partly to explain technical reasons.
The amendment in the United States Acts on the personal banks from 2005 has led to a large number of stated banks that make a large part of the loss of credit cards; the number of reports (and the number of receipts) would therefore be taken into account if the general conditions for the participants have been disappointed.
The sector also shows the good peace of fulfillment that shows how many consumers a month from their payments.
And the trust in the price papers insured credit cards is firm, and through the paralysis in other structured financial costs.
Mr. Dennis Moroney from the research company of TowerGroup prevents that their emissions will be more than 25% of the branches for 2007.
Additional paths for expanding infections between the crisis undertaking hypothesis and the credit cart market are decisively present: if they explore the pets for the names of disease, consumers are often involved through credit cards.
However, credit cards are often looking for money than the values of the main objectives, so the falling home prices do not need to mean the change of confidentiality of the distributors.
They can even be worthy for the provider.
The motive of the consumers to spread hypothesis is fulfilled when the value of their maturity is claimed under the value of the currency; in consequence, the duration of the cards is placed up to the list of priorities to place.
The delivery caret also provides a faster and flexible react on more lower conditions than the provider of the hypothesis that changes the rate rates or limits of the conformity.
This should be theoretically reduced risks to quickly change the prices of the main targets.
"It's not that we'll just have a beautiful morning so that you'll have all the pieces," says Gary Perlin, the Financial Office of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosion in the style of low hypothesis is low, the danger of accessible exploitation is far more real.
If the lower prices of home and reduction of debts are driving America into the reese, credit cards will stand before the darkest future.
Take care of the bullshit.
The British bankers accepted the vindication in the case of Enron.
Three britain bankers, who had to be condemned for their role in the context of the old financial concert of Enron Andrew Fastow, have changed the guidance in the middle of them and have recognised the wine.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, originally in the seven offences of the fashion, when they had to participate in the financial shipment in 2000 -- to obtain their employers' account -- they write.
They had to stand before the court in July.
However, during the judicial translation before the American period judge Ewin Verleyn Jr., every one was admitted to one condemnation.
The case of these three former employees of Greenwich NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, figured on the front pages for two years, which continued to be carried out.
In the United States, their cases are one of the unlocked parts of the investigation of the starting investigation after Enron's road in 2001.
The accusation against them in 2002, Mr Fastowa warned that it was the goal investigation objective of Enron's challenge.
Bullshit against bankers -- who served the NatWest's Three - says that in 2000 they came to Houston to be convicted with Fastow and his ancient main pool Michael Kopper.
The company Greenwich NatWest invested to the partner pool of Enron controlled Fastow, which was an architecture of many enron-based architectures, which carried out Enron after the spiral direction to declare the bankrot.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank decided that he had a part in this shipment of zero, however, our three British knew that he had actually a significant value.
The company under the Capper Control was buying the bank shares in this pocket for $1 million.
Increminal bankers sold Kapper for a share in this company 2500,000 dollars.
According to Fastow claimed to Enron that the energy company would pay for its share in this poverty of Greenwich NatWest 20 million dollars.
Of course, 20 million of them actually went to British bankers, Fastowa and others.
Bankers received 7,3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and others improved $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow accepted a vindication in two cases for his task in Enron's assembly.
The British trio was arrested for three months later.
Fastow is currently in the exercise of sixty challenges in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Cooper is in the trial of three years and one month in Texarkan's device.
All three of the British moved on the freedom for $1,000, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the coming court.
Enron, once seven largest company in the country, was assembled to bankrot in 2001 after the period of periods of account tricks could not be able to save billion debts or to demonstrate false speculation as eggs.
The exploitation has disappeared thousands of workplaces, more than 60 billion dollars of market values and more than 2 billion dollars in pension assessment.
The officer of Enron Kenneth Lay and the main leader Jeffrey Skilling were judged last year for their tasks in the field of company.
Skilling is in the execution of more than forty-fifty years.
The reasons of the Lay's excuses were deleted after he died in heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-powerability
Gulfstream G550 airport price, saved by Rolls-Royce and with a sufficient packed pack for nesttop years from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at 54 million dollars.
Some of the Russian riches, however, are detailed to return.
"He can take up to 18 ways," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream Leader.
"But no one of them doesn't care for many places because it's for a family or a federal president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in the tent of Gulfstream the last fifth at the Million Exponent, which is the fourth-day organ of the consumption in the mamuth of the main city's periphery.
In addition to Gulfstream, its staff was set over 200 other Luxus additives, who hoped that the rich Russians were attached to all from the mahagon designed jackets after diamants to the car that would not be shocked or 50 cents.
Mr. Firer watched carefully after the clear ornamental Porsche in the nearby tent.
"It's a good car, but it's five hundreds and decades against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market of private aircraft."
On the rocks of the rocks, the Russian main town plays money as well as when Dallas had his days.
"We have seen the same station in 80 years when some Americans were very rich and went to Europe where they looked like materialists," said Marshall Goldman, listening to the fourth year of the Russian Centre and European Studies in Harvard.
As Saudi speakers from 70 and Japan in the 90s, the Russians are the most prominent world losers.
Inexcludible luxury tags are looking for this Clondic their part.
On another place in Moscow this week, the Conference of the Luxus Industries of Donald Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of the LVMH group, came to exchange ideas on how to sell favorite goods on the markets, such as the Russian.
(The International Herald Tribune, whose own company The New York Times Company.)
Russia has the list of the most rich people of Forbes 53 billion magazine with a total number of 282 billion dollars.
The local main Institute in the Office Center for Economic and Financial Research has also reported on the development of personal riches in the Old Soviet Sweden, which is in Russia 103,000 "drugs" millions, which are in a number of $670 billion.
(The World Bank indicates that in 2005, 15.8% of the Russians had been raised under the minimum of existing.)
"In Moscow there are hundreds of millions -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, the vendor and marketing director of David Morris.
She was on the first wheel, together with the Russian distributor of this tag, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are unbelievable, and men are every one for a whole name."
When they traveled in the evening shadows on the evening evening, Eugene Yumatov, one-year-year-old and five-year-old-year-year-olds, and their clients were notified as millions.
"I was looking at that car and I couldn't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatov, who held in a lot of clothes as a wheel of red coppers, with whom Joan Rivers looks like a home trap.
Veletrh seemed to be employed in particular to the pure riches, marked by the Russian purchases, which are desirable to seize a couple of hours in the motor drive, so that they could go through the boards that crying out of the Cadillacy Escalade, platinary fishes, the Mövenpick, the cycle tables for peace, apartment in Dubai, the Gund and the front.
Member States could buy income for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"Russians are interested in what the mark is the best and the best," said Mr Gijrath, which married the tent of the Netherlands manufacturer of Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from manually small blue boxes in the super-level size.
"It's probably interesting Russia's more late."
And, in fact, the purchasers say that the Russians with the old money (low Russian measures is 10 to 15 years old) have already been sent from the white logs to a lot of known limited editions that would never have been able to buy the buying veterinary.
And so many thousands of people, already millions of people, sending millions or simple tourists, each day they welcomed the fulfillment balls.
And some of them bought.
The first day of the exposure, last fourth, Rom Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil, sold two matra saddles from hair, cashmear and bathrooms, protected by gold nicks, after 70 000 dollars.
The first day also said Mikhail Lybimov, the A1 Moto vendor, who delivers high-end car alarms that his company sold clearly ornamental Porsche for 170 000 dollars to the Russian billion.
On Wednesday, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which carrys the Luxembourg car that he sold three miles in the car in the style of proposed rates for Rolls-Royce Pantoma for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the road of the car proposed for the Russian manager of Casino, which had to spend the Swazian cristalls so that it seemed like a rule.
Price: $20,000 for four.
"The Russian billion, who wants a roof of a cup or a portrait of his wife from a quick church, has no need to lead on those rounds yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He puts them into his garage for 30 to 40 cars."
Although there are many of his Russian rich clients, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russ billion" today does not mean much exclusive, with regard to the increase of the prices of the potential.
"If you buyed three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably billions, at least on the paper when you're not ready," said.
"They're more than you think."
Those who are not billionars could at least prevent richness in the camp of the Russian industry of Alliance Continental, which is active management.
The company involved four red phone buyers of the British style of false banking columns in the value of millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, stated that his team was printed for Veletrh Milioners of 500 000 false banks.
The colleagues stopped to break around money, or to leave the friend to photograph a mobile phone, as they rest in the middle of the riches, or just cut out a couple of millions.
"You know, everyone in Moscow can feel as a millioner," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a dead operation
It was a day before the Honor of Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the great windows of the highest restaurant about something of health and watched the sanitacy that came to the white new English house about two houses from West Scott Avenue.
The police car has been connected soon.
And then another.
"I've seen how she came to the court doctor," Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"In that moment I knew someone died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, a Executive Assistent Director of the Neward Police Division.
The investigators are now trying to determine whether she died because of the process of an unlimited plastic chirurg which the police's identity refused to provide that he worked in the house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet discovered what Mrs. Arroy died, and they hope that toxicological tests whose results have not to be known for a week, will help to resolve the crucial death that leads to the inherited police's fault.
Mrs. Arroy was a police director assistent, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was a lot of known for the division.
"It was loyal, dear and hard worked," Mrs. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroy in the telephone interview in the middle.
"I was my bed.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroy was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an old non-warrant police, who works for the Commission for the control of alcohol drinks, and that he leaves two sons in the age 14 and 11 and an independent daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the State Manager of the Union period, Theodora J. Romankaw, said that detectives are trying to find whether Ms. Arroy died on the results of unlimited chirurg operation.
"It's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"The investigation is still running."
The officers said that they got a ship in three hours afternoon 21.
November and they found Mrs. Arroy on the shoes.
She was spoken to the place for death.
For more than a week later, the offices were still talking about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is given to Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh didn't tell if the offices have heard Mrs. Castro.
The researchers are trying to determine whether the home part was used as order.
In the middle of Mrs. Castrove, with a broken rose in the former garden and a Dalmatine smoking back, nobody answered
Below the doors that led to the skin, he remained in the open garage of the blue barl with the label "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is used as a smoke of vanil in food and cosmetics.
On the works on one side, she saw two horse rounds.
Mr. McCarthy reminded that when he first arrived after 25 years in New York's Police Department, Mrs. Arroy gave him an invaluable help in trying to be unfortunately and indulgent political culture of his new city.
"He said, 'To this or this, you should give attention,' said.
"I was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was crazy."
Speaking that Fed reduces the smokes, leads to send the world's towns
The prices of actions on both sides of Atlantic have been raised yesterday after the hope of the market that the Federal Bank is trying to restrain the conditions of payment by the reduction of rate sazes, were sent to the relaxing explanations of the American Central Banks.
In London, New York, and, for example, after Donald Kohn, the second in order after Ben Bernanc, President Fedu, said that in response to continue pressing on financial markets, the "flexible and desirable actions".
In the framework of public trying to calm down the required markets in the middle of the signs of credit currency, Mr. Kohn said that the recent expressions "with partly renewed some improvements in the functioning of markets to the end of September and October."
In addition, he stated that if the higher instability survives, it increases the possibility of financial conditions of households and fires further worse.
Investors consider these expressions for the signal that Fed is prepared to add more low doses to the capital, and may also reduce further rate satellites to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped Wall Street to calm down among other wrong reports on American economy when the sale of lives in October showed a recorded lower number.
The results of financial credibility were undertaken by the investment banks of Bear Stearns, that 650 workplaces, which are 4 % of its world work forces, in the framework of reducing costs, because of the difficult losses caused by non-profits to provide undertaking for residence in America.
It's expected that only 20 of these places will be interrupted in London where the bank is employed by 1 500 people.
In New York he grows industrial index Dow Jones with 331 points, or 2,55 percent, and closed 13 289,40, while more used S&P 500 was raised to 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE index 100 raised 165,5 points, or 2,7 per cent, and held 6 306,2, and the value of the British blue-chips increased over 39 billion library.
The German Dax index increased 2,6 per cent and France CAC40 increased 2.3 per cent.
For a while, the credit income on the markets showed in full power after at August of the Third months' money packages of the European Central Banks were funded by the European trade banks at the end of 4,7 %, which is at least since April 2001.
Click on the English Bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and expose the London's over-standard money market, he increased by the three months of the United Kingdom interbank rate "Libor" after an uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum of the end of September - 6,59 percent.
English must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We've got two dilemmas, one at least as hard as the other.
Who's going to be the number of six on the battle for England this week in Canada, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in the largest context of nothing less relevant than the first test against Sri Lance, who has to do this decision?
The second question is essential because David Grainey, the President of the electoral Commission, who is the best at this time, has Peter Moores, the main trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, with a decision to help and since the table of Hugha Morrise, the main manager of the English team, begins to fulfill applications on the post of the national electoral electoral, not to be fulfilled.
He who doesn't stand on the sixth place on the ground will be unfortunate, but life often is not fair and sport already not.
It's not easy to find that one will get on the top of his professor, while someone else will never get over the low level, sometimes because of the unfortunateness of the ability.
Not only in the critical selection is an annual and requires a reason that, finally, must always be subjective.
Is it a right time to move Bopara up?
It's a mistake to Shah, right?
In the same way, we could also ask in other areas, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Bannerie, both young leaders with a good training and spectrum in the council, should be higher to the Commission - the place is only for one.
Who's going to say what level is right for the cricketers if he doesn't have a chance to pay or pay for another?
Naturally, they have numeros to decide great influence, but they have the same opportunity.
In the team, the cricketist must take the view of the captain, if he has to take a weakness, and the battery needs a regular chance for starting positions, if he has sometimes to make a busy as a single cricketer.
Keep the selection view is more complicated.
For example, in the lone salon, there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seems to be sure, even if Stephen Harmison had proclaimed as a healthy and overseased as a robber.
Anderson took 32 kids in the first class at 33 travels to everybody.
Chris Tremlett took at the same great average only 29, but they both had their moments at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If it's going to play the Asgirya Shah station, or Bopara can only be a view.
The choice can develop or get a carrier both, or also does not have a great influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lance, Gareth Batty played in each test and in the first class gave good executions, five hundreds and 40 free moves, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was in the same time fighting about his place who finally was a stabil test cricket, which was, even though, in Australia, two hundred points in Australia, might have been submitted.
It is most likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion on the today's training training, they will follow their conservative instincts and give Shah's greater experience before Bopar's young construction.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, his strict and valuable debut test changes in 88 points in Bombaji and 32 hundreds in the first class of contrast to six Bopar, which is, in twenty years, about seven years younger, and has an excellent statistics against the spin.
However, Shah made in two changes in May against Caribbean in the Test of Lord's Lord's, his home mistake in Middlesex, only ten moves, and it, together with the immediate refusing of the elections, when Ho Vaughan wanted to reach the next storm, his burning seemed to have some of the elean that was so evident in Bombai.
In contrast, the Esx Universal has joy of vivre in costs.
At the cricket shooting he doesn't touch him, and his behavior is symbolized recently transformed cars with an emergency on four rounds at the exhibitive day of the automobile sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He went out with easy sufferings and shocks, but as the first thing he went out his Vodafone (surely also sponsored), and called Alastair Cook, his partner who followed this, to ask him, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is decisively better in the field, its middle fast smiley overcomes on the outer crimes that seem to be exhausted, efficiently distributed and burning self-deceived and explored.
Choosing a right man is one thing, choosing the right time is different.
Maybe it's just a real choice.
I'm particularly closing that Bopara gets his chance now, however, I don't want to say Shah's not exceeding if, as the cheese letters indicate, it's the one who's going to play here next week.
Autobuses bring back to work - and to battle against Al-Qayda
First buss full of the Irish shirts from Syria started getting to Bagdad yesterday and getting out of the outcome that money has received or has expired the time of wine, and others who hoped that the city returns to normal life.
Some were even returned to fight the weapons who were out of their houses.
Mansur bus was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convention of buses, full buses from Syria and Jordan, who returned private transport.
"I decided to go to Siria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Saba al-Kubajs, the sunite doctor.
"Today I came back because of what I saw in the TV and about what I read in news, because of what happened in Bagdad and how it's safe now.
"They say the Mahdian Army has stopped killing people," he said, "he's the thought of a shift military military of the Military Spirit Muktady of Al-Sadra, which temporarily ordered his people to interrupt war.
Kasim al-Atwani, the eighth-year-year-old Sweden teacher from the overwhelming Sunny Area Amaria, returned with his two children, because he could not renew the syrry wine, and because he did not allow the Iraqians to work in a closest mode.
His Sweden neighbors in Amaria called him with that the local household with the support of the American army helped the Al-Kaid out of her position at the west of the main city, and they had to return.
One of the new joints of Jordan is the manager of the Sunnite and Sweet kmene, who was from his house in Sleikh in North Bagdad after he had found a granatic attack on his colleagues to rise against Al-Kyda.
He came back to fight.
"Firstly, a few friends called me and told me that they're divorced in Sleikh's military against Al-Kyda and that he needs me and support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 20-year-old.
Many have spoken about the calmness in the main city after sending American military attitudes and the growth of local "scrolled citizens" who are armed in the hands on the side of the American army to shoot their fourth.
But more of the fact that they were to be able to build a built around wine and the tent of money in Damascus, where in the last years more than 1,3 million Iraqians.
Salaam al-Samaraj, one-four thirty-year-year-old father, exclaimed the voice of the subscription shared between the urgents that Nuri al-Maliki, the Sweden-Premier, requested the Syrian government to restrict the restrictions on the water of the surface and took them back.
According to the available data, more than two and half million people were excited before Iraq's sector murders.
"It was all right before Al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving the Iraqian knowledge to have to return to Iraq," said the Sunitarian manager.
"I can't believe the government that supports criminals who burned me after my home."
The party reason for violence is the fact that the sunners were exceeded from the late areas and, immediately, that is reduced in many places.
They appear to be afraid that the excessive extent of the security infection is renewed and brings it to the next war.
Little Sarke, good education
The least community country Germany plays in a good education of leadership, exceeds even international purposes by its high schools.
Only in one education area, Sarkio is the same disagreement as the rest of Germany.
"A man who doesn't come from Sarkia, I explained yesterday after 50th, that we are not a France" - this Sebeironical password in Sarkia appears on plaquetes at the time of the 50th birthday of this less community country.
Finally, France and Luxembourg play in the Sars education system, which is in monitoring of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) at the fifth place, great role.
High schools are so traditionally coopered with the areas.
The University in Saarbrücken was based on France in 1948.
Moreover here students can end a double or even a triple diplome.
What is responsible for the higher part of foreign students, which makes 15,6 %.
Because the average number of sahary children is accepted at high school - many of them even without a study on the field.
"In Sarsk uses a beautiful education system," says Axel Plennecke, IW training expert.
As more than each fifth younger has the right to study a good student, Sarkio is more than 7% of the German average.
In comparison with the rest of Germans, there are rich opportunities in Sarska to combinate practical and academic education.
The possibilities of studying two fields are regarding the number of citizens of the second best in all Germany.
In the past years, the number of injectors of third-term in the practically orientated training and the question of the training.
Therefore, the Sahara Ministry of School has now been commanded high schools to create propaganda campaigns on engineering organisations.
"After the first study of the writer, we have done a few reforms at the university educational schools," says the speaker of the Ministry of School.
The Government therefore carried out comparison tests in all Germany.
To start learning the children first, the last year of maternal schools is an unpagable model that overcome other society countries.
If the results of requests are explicitly better, the future comparison studies will be shown.
In the period of 2003, Pisa studies, the risk requests decreased from 29 to 20 %.
However, Sark has not improved so much as other society countries.
The balls can be better counting.
And to the discourage of Sarska studies of Pisa, the knowledge of strange languages is not equal to the knowledge of the other languages - in the case that Sark could just be in this area.
The language of the seeds is also responsible for the magnitudes - even though Sarkie citizens are not France.
Conscious moves hours
What can't see hours go in Venezuela except in the rest of the world.
9 December, President Hugo Chavez allows you to move hours in this South American country about half an hour back.
In Spanish, there is a funny figure between Chaveze.
The Official Letter of Venezuela informed that the hours in accordance with the new law to reach the world's time at least four and half hours.
The South American State will be this step in the time period that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The enemy of the United States has caused his decision to be other than that the United States have entered the world's separation of time for all hours.
In the middle of the local time, Chavez also announced that the relationships with the Soviet Colombia are interrupted because of the case with the hands.
This Lewis Nationalist announced that until the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia will not hold any relationship with him nor with the Colombia Government.
"I can't, because of my own self,," said Chavez, who makes a reform of the statutes, about which this land has to be able to vote in a weekly reference.
This reform would make Cavez his power in the country explicitly.
The challenge was invited to the Uribe's decision to reject Chavez's conviction to declare in Colombia with marxist rebels on the exemption of the hands.
Uribe with his decision Venezuela "played in his face," criticized in Uribe Chavez's week.
And in Spanish, everybody talks about Chavez.
The new mobile call here called "Why do these callas" (Why do you're not silent?) - so it seems to be a bit that has been over half million people gone out of the Internet.
The Spanish King John Carlos, who, on the recent Iberoamic top-shirt summit, the vote of this Lewis popularity, considered that he had been in this way.
Germans in 2007 are lower payments
According to the prognoses, there are severe years to German employees reducing real measures and through strong conjunction.
Experts have caused a total number of reasons.
According to the challenges of Nadace Hanse Böckler in 2007, people can actually calculate that they will get a lower rate than in the long-term year.
"Vin is a small increase of payments, increases from added values and increased prices in food and energy," said the Deputy Image Gustav Horn from the IMK research institution (Institute for macroeconomic and Conjunkturforschung).
The new employment may also expect insurance areas of unemployment.
The Ministry of Peer Steinbrück news New Osnabrücker Zeitung said that the new year planned reduction of the insurance of 3,3 % is right and wise.
However, the Community agency would not have to be able to fall into such disagreements that from society youths youths should be required to quote the news of this social democratic policy.
It was published in the absorption that the price explosion of food and disease products has exposed inflation on its highest status for the past thirty years.
In an annual comparison of the total prices of three percent.
Venuses is a penal Double Earth
In his life of an enemy atmosphere, Venus Earth is more likely than that. The European cosmic sonda Venus Express at Venus recorded ices that appear in the shadows also on Earth: white in atmosphere and wind faith in the field.
He's almost three decades of scientists thinking he's white on Venus.
Now the European sand of Venus Express has proved - has taken the electromagnetic bowls on the border of the atmosphere. On Venus flow white from the dark to the dark around 56 miles, written in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from California University in Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the primary plants on Earth, the bowls were called in the oceans of reactions that led to the impact of aminooxide, basic stones of life.
In Venus, it wasn't like that, "If there was a life there, it had to be very long," explains Sean Solomon from Carnegie institution in Washington.
The atmosphere is probably 100 times hard than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Your is likely a dual land, but it's a double,," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is the earth’s smoke and the size of the same way, began to develop completely differently, is the basic question of Esa.
Considering that since the beginning of 90 years there was no sonda was sent out for Venus studies, the start of Venus Express was in the study of this planet in November 2005.
According to scientists, the most recent results of the research closed by several articles of the Nature magazine were not only adjusted by Venus in the sun.
"They also showed that our neighbour planet is similar to the Earth than it still thought," Esa said.
Besides the known wind faiths in the northern field, the scientists found dark faith in the southern field that seems very faster.
This phenomenon reminds the aircrafts on the North Pool, writes a research team under Guiseppe Piccioni's leader of the Italian institution Instituto di Astrofisica Spacial and Fisica Cosmica.
The second internal planet of our sun structure creates almost the same temperature as the Earth and with average of 12,100 km is almost the same.
This planet marked as Jitrinka or Wednesday will feed the Sun for 225 days.
However, by its own axes, it's a lot of shortages. One day on Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus is the top temperature of 460 °C and by 92 bars of the Earth does not remember, the scientists are out of the fact that both planets have become very similar.
But on the earth she remained in the oceans while from Venus she appeared to the universe.
While the temperature of oxyd on Earth is carbonated on the earth, Venus creates most atmospheres.
The cigarette covers the meetings of the Merkels with the remote flame
The Communial President Kihler requires the end of strange sports because of a lot of officers.
Nevertheless, the SPD criticized her attacks on the office after one meeting in September.
The Common President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reporting of Germany and calling a great coal to finish the shipment around the room.
"We should not be presented as a nation who is not a single question," said Kehler to the Economic News of Trade Blatt.
Today, the understanding for the decision of German offices of Angely Merkel (CDU) to adopt the further labour in September.
"But I respect cultural differences, they have human rights for me," said Kihler.
The Common President also suggested that everybody knew that Germany had to keep a understanding equation in the front-line policy, but it didn't allow him to stop the Merkels when it was ready to create a new policy in China.
"Spolk officer was not exhausted from the traditional Chinese uniform policy.
China also knows, "He said.
Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has given an enemy to his unconnexion with the remote accommodation, and he was attached from a number of coalices.
Steinmeier ran outside the "progress" frontal coalyce policy.
The German-Chinese relationships were corrupted after we received a lot in the office.
Not only the Chinese Government has interrupted the invitation of the German Financial Ministry of Peera Steinbrücka (SPD), but, according to the information of the SPIEGEL magazine, the strategic dialogue of the Ministry for both countries has also disappeared.
The Chinese President of the Government of Wen Jiabao invited the officer of Angel Merkelo to recognize that the remote adoption was an error.
China does not swallow when European policies officially accept the Tibet’s spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao's position of China.
The words and actions we have shown that Tibet is together with other Tibet areas that are also in China, trying to separate from China.
Shauble warns for similar diseases that have appeared in France
Political bits with police, shooting, shooting car. Wolfgang Schäuble warns for similar diseases that appeared in France.
We have to do everything to make so that social concerns in Germany have not grown in violence on the street, calling a society minister inside.
Barikady hidden, explorers shoot the brooks on the police. After several diseases of young people in France, the community minister in Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is both like developments in Germany.
"We have to be careful that we should not also create such social infringements that will be in violence.
We have to do this seriously," he said in the Hawaii New Presse news.
Not every young man can be able to compare with a quick change of social reality.
Community governments, lands and aliens have already worked hardly to remove problems, said Schauble.
It doesn't mean only the integration of migrants.
"On the summary of integration after the conference of Islam, we report the first success."
However, the obsession is still on the place.
Sheuble presently showed that the planning and social problems of German companies are not comparable with those French.
In the nights, the young people with the police at the north offices of Paris were struggled with severe valley battle.
And in Toulouse, the car and the public buildings were hidden.
The most integrating efforts of German government required President of Turkish neighbors in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the relationship in France, Kolat warned the "security effect."
The situation in Germany should not be as excited as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat showed that between people under 25 years, who are going from the family of migrants, is a "increasingly high."
First, it is necessary to ensure the larger number of studies.
"We have to give a younger hope."
The President of Turkish, but still added that in Germany there is a larger social control of family in France.
Moreover, many young people of the migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we have to be careful."
We have to make a younger "joy to let them start working and training."
At the midnight, there's been night at Paris's office Villiers-le-Bel quietly.
There were hundreds of police and the aircraft flowed with lightlomets.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and several branches of disasters and cars.
Since yesterday, calm relaxs about about 1,000 order forces.
The police will keep as long as it will be necessary, she has announced after the visit of the Ministry within Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In the challenges of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 cops were struck night.
The next night, Toulouse's worst.
Nothing has chosen an accident in the case of two young people have come to life.
In accordance with the first recognition of the State Defence, the police will not have any sin in the death of young people.
In the Years of Angely "Oblaks"
The officer actually remote output documents that coalyce is programming at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it.
In what land is this office really living?
After her unfortunate, unfortunately discovered and containing poor exhibition to the general debt of the Community dream: not here - not in this country that it should be finally controlled.
In the meaning that it focuses too much on the foreign policy, Angela Merkel replied once a lot of arrogant wind.
It's provincial, she said what she showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are going to do.
In the Community's dream, she had all seen how much it serves.
The Mercel was not to feel a real interest, so the citate for problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblak": a policy, which is exceeding the others who are in the foreign policy, and is also expressed wisely.
Thus, for example, climate protection: without interrupting, they praise for the conclusions of the summit in Santandam, but it doesn't say how the climate objectives should be achieved in Germany.
And, in fact, it was so self-- so much unconsciousness would be forgiven the Chairman of the CDU for two years ago.
Now it is limited to a plane forefather that could increase the obstacle between people.
This approach will enhance his own desires that do not need to be limited because the problems are resolved.
But in the Years of Angely "Oblaks" there are internal political problems of the road matter.
Children's poorness and worries people with low grounds?
A couple of the neighbors left her to these themes.
For the appreciation of the Mercels often, when it's about children's addictions, it's interpreted.
Three times the Merkel has to start from the beginning so that it may be given to it at least partly partly correctly.
When things are starting to be very specific, it's like a strange territory.
Department of Agreement
The Debatte of the Republic Chairmans of the YouTube candidates was in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitta Romney, and both must be concerned with the outside candidate.
Injury of both candidates is already shown at the first subject.
Mitt Romney suggests Rudy Guilianim that he made a "fight for illegal accuser."
Giuliani quickly reacts to the strict officers: "I believe that his own house was just one of such a challenge," he answers and presents the former gubernament of Massachusetts, who, particularly, employed the imigrants without evidence.
The candidates are attached to the attack. In view of that the Republic's basic foundation has no clear favorite, eight President candidates use these discussions on the CNN to discuss their support.
Middle-minute, Internet users attached and YouTube sended videos only serve as such key theme.
"Now we have allowed Hitler to keep power," John McCain presents his supporter Ronu Paulo, who is the only one of the military wars from Iraq.
The Vietnamian veteran McCain does not take care of his experts or Romney, because he refuses to judge the mutual audience method called "Waterboarding" where the top is simulated.
The public reactions in the Florida St. Petersburg show that between the important theme of the campaign doesn't seem to be a war in Iraq, nor to murder methods.
The obecenst smokes in the box when concert values are exceeded and denied the future increase of data.
So she'll show where the weakness of both favorites is.
"I'm wrong this time," explains Romney deceived and requests a page base and a television public about forgiveness for that it was still a manner of execution of penalties in 1994.
Giulian is in the discipline when it is to be expressed to a perfect Bible exemption.
Musharaf's first government in civil
The day after his disappearance from the position of the officer of the army, the Pakistan Governor of the President Mosharaf.
This ends eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parviz Mušaraf, held the Chairman's vow on the fourth, and was taking into the President's office for five more years.
The Pakistan’s TV was transmitted a live ceremonie, which was held in the Chairman Palace in the main city of Islamabad.
Musharaf sweared that he would respect the statute and rejoice for a good nation.
In the middle of his Supreme Leader of Army, his truster Ashfaq's Kiyani, which has made an international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after the power of the non-profit military reverence, the old general will first rule as a civilian head of the State.
Aparting from the position of the officer of armed forces, Musharaf fulfilled one of the main requirements of obsession and West.
The next central request is an interruption of the exclusive state that Musharaf published on November 3.
According to the Supreme State Deputy Malika Muhammada Qayuma, the Musharaf will reject the special state soon after his jury, and will fulfil another of the requirements of the West.
The Supreme Court of the Court of Justice that Musharaf, after the declaration of the exclusive state at the beginning of November, contained to him the lawyers in the past week, rejected all amendments on the sustainable recovery of the State head of 6 October.
Interestingly, five soldiers were killed at the attack of military conventions in the north Vasiristan field, and four others were destroyed.
The speaker of the army showed that the bomb was explored on the street a lot of border with the Afganistan.
Catch crautrock is returned
The German group of seventy years plays again. Three members of the Harmony groups were on the concert in Berlin again conducted their electronic synthesis.
Revival will also offer Live 1974, sister of the most successful time of chapels.
That time, they were most famous in the frontier.
The flatless disappearance then ends in the exhibition of three famous masters who look at the beginning as they're just going to eat.
Everybody's got a box, a box, and most of the bottoms.
Thirty-seventy-year-old Dieter Moebius was sitting in the middle of the dreams.
After his left is Michael Rother, a seven-year-old-year-old, who has a laptop and a cytar.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 30-year-old-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on synthesators, is from the view of wonders right.
Everybody sings sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, uncertainly, the traditional trace will be raised.
It seems that it's not too bad for musicians.
In the middle of the crautrocks, he called to revise the Harmony capses a significant disruption.
One thing is here to be noted. Repeated questions showed that this name is even part of the collective understanding of the pope, but it is decisively not so mistaken to put this capel twenty-three years in pain.
But why would German not celebrate his lived league from 70 years?
And especially when you're a music style, a false named crautrock, in England and in America is more price than in their own country.
In 2003, when musicians shared the remaining members of the Colin Group of Can Echo price for life work, there was a full full of detailed views of German fountains.
Moreover, when Red Hot Chili Peppers had thanked the groups of La Düsseldorf and Neu!, he had no longer known border.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concert with them as their old friends.
The problem of ignoring home and degradation in the foreign is one thing.
Remembering the Harmony Cape, this trio existed only two years, and there was no effect that others had to be considered later.
Moebius and Roedelius have already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
In the beginning, they played in the Berlin Divadle of Shaubchune.
Then in Düsseldorf, from economic reasons in the graphphone company led the church.
Rother was shortly raised at the Fortwork Group, however, the news was received as a cytarist at the New Capel!, which might have been the most radical German group in that time.
In 1973 Rother followed musicians of Cluster capely capely in Forst in Wezerbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, in the 16th century, they lived as members of the communities who departed from the city.
They lived here as idealistly as in the company I, where Roedelius still was able to steal as a cheese.
It was a lot of life in such a switch-wheel apartment.
The name for this science is fully removed from the name of Harmoni Ottenstein, whose resignation has been found in the prison.
Many of that harmony have been kept.
The first album was called "Hudba from Harmonie" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so quiet and slowly, she suffered the head with financial difficulties.
The Russian collection was not only a self-conscience.
The video CD "Live 1974" has now been held at the concert in Greece before recruitedly small, softly 50-year-old kidney.
Rothera said that time, to the members of Harmonie were able to be able to move.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a very incompatible requirement.
In 1975, the chapter announced his divorce.
Rother ended in the istheric shirt, and his future seemed to be the Alb of "Highing heart."
Capel Cluster lived again in the eighth years, and since that time it's more successful than Harmonia when she was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grejenemeyer for the Live Album of Greesemer.
His loading company Greenland was taken for the purpose of crautrock to watch as a original German writer to living music.
Captain Neu! was considered Roedeli's only work.
The significant resurrection of Harmonie is conducted in the Berlin World Culture.
The exhibition in the Festival Woldtronics will be publicly sponsored.
It'll be the brit, Julian Cope, the old manner and the manufacturer of Crautrock Sampler.
It's party and the founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
That's how we read the whole width of the crautrock influence on the future pop music.
The empty place of the honour group is fulfilled right to Harmon.
Brian Ena's visit to the most amazing sounds are raised in the room, "The only right music, it's the future."
There are images on which the manufacturer with Harmony in the agricultural seat.
To create lengements also contributes to promote other black-white photos on which are a sale of divorce equipment connected chambers.
Three veterans have been employed again.
I'm not able to make microphones on warnings and bubns to make these tools never heard of self-produced tones.
The electronic music today looks like an electronic music.
Three in the technology of the pointer's shooter.
There's nothing to do with the world's cultures.
Below Barbara Morgenster's guidance, it's a smoke under the sound dark, and on a beautiful place, it's emfatically singing "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always very English.
It's never about Rock.
The roots would be likely to find in blues on music high schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwork) or in the effort of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who calls '68' on this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmone will not leave out of peace.
It's the most sure that it's about the scene that's exactly thinking.
Where's the music starting, and when does it end?
This question will be prepared for the nerve, or will allow him to survive the weakest moments of happiness.
Richard Gere's just not too cynical.
With the films The Hunting Party and Morderischer Frieden, there were just two films on the Balkan war.
But no one of them is convinced.
The prevention of films is too big to act and shoot, or they're too low.
It's not in the Hunting Party, nor a heritage like Richard Gere.
Good news as the first: Valentine criminals of Karadir and Mladić are still hidden in the mountains of Balkan, but just there, in the campaign of Bosen war, herec Richard Gere is worthy.
In the last time, we lost this beautiful man of eighty years, not only because he played in many favorable, unbelievable role in women films, but in connection with his print conferences forever on the Buddhism, the man will take the other film with this hero.
And however, Richard Gere is the most strongest argument to see the Hunting Party - Where's favorite is a benefit (Why should film names be so long and occupied today?)
Gere provides a cooking exercise. His military reporter Simon Hunt is based on who Gere could be, if the branches and the movies were not so miserable: a man who has his best year for a long time, but as a little similar memorator continues to keep awareness.
But even through this trauma is the Hunting Party together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters into the kitchen this week, just continuing unexpected numbers of unseen films on the Balkan war.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This movie is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save the heart girl before the cosmical shooter, and one of them loves it.
Although it's happy that there's not Serbow's been represented as a cause of all evil, this television is changed as soon as soon as soon as to the shooting and action.
The movie will be a lot of similar series of Kobru 11, even without the farm, but for the war.
The Hunting Party's movie will be explicitly investigated why the Balkan War has not yet been able to play a really good film.
Three American military reporters who are referred to as "liss", the Serbian supreme military criminals would be in another time and under the leader of another government and scenario (here is Richard Shepard) may be a new "Apocalypse".
Because both story are surprised: small groups go into the forest to do something that is not capable of military, however their ways will become a way to disappoint.
One of the reasons that the Hunting Party has been successful is that Simon Hunt is not a threat and sensitive cynic designed at the beginning.
On the other hand, we're going to write a romantic afer with a Bosnian Muslim later killed.
The Hunting Party, we can receive the final validity after the reporters in the last five quickly quick minutes of the movie brings what is NATO, CIA and all the people of the world's criminals in the past five years have not been able to take the crime and to leave it justly in the boss muslims.
It's so contrary to the logic of the film creatures that would still be turned to the International Court of Haag.
Then this film has a deep human message.
It notes that Karadir and Mladić are still free and submitts America and France (which they are exclusively unique) that they do not beyond the secret political agreement.
But good and bad are sometimes similar, a woman will take us to the blame of Brecht.
It is about the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the worker's table: "I'm sure I'm looking at the room, and I recognize: how to be bad."
In films such as The Hunting Party, the heads of the heads are exceedingly excited, but they indicate how it is to be good.
This problem is not only limited to the war on Balkan.
Recently, in these newspapers, all Hollywood films of Iraq were great success.
It can be added to the only one: No good film on South Africa has never been attached.
While it is always paid: When the star is attached to the crisis area or goes through the mining field, it's a movie like Rangoon and Patricia Arquette, Grencies with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprim.
Perhaps all these conflicts are just a lot of time.
The ends had to move ten years before Hollywood could play a good film on the Holocust - Shindler's list.
Many films often need to be seen - movies which are considered today as a classic Vietnamian work - "The Love of Yellow", "Apocalypse" or "Olypse" - were not in any case glorified as mysterious work.
But maybe today, when every mass murder is opened home immediately on two screens, we know too much about conflicts of this world.
Then the scenarios do not have the capacity that is needed to make sense of good story.
"By be or not" or "Great Diktator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't even know how terriblely he had ruled in the native mode.
Maybe a man doesn't want to be good if he wants to do good films.
Perhaps you must create a scarcaticly redimensionated artificial view as the Romans Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was attached to the parallel between his his historical Rome "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "Balkan's War," he said, "The worm is only in the fact that some things will never go.
The majority will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is criticism for olympiads
The anticipation of aeroplane olympian heroes in Hamburg was attached to political and economic crisis.
Many want to fight further for the order of the water.
Von Beust, but it's favorable to realism in an opportunity.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the main business officer in Hamburg, in the middle of this decision, "with a lot of business for trouble."
There were no other projects in the last time in the city as a great motivation as an olympian thought.
"Besides this purpose, it would not be possible to maintain this sportly political surprise in such a high dimension."
Schmidt-Trenz called Senat to not build this project, but made for him a new long-term concept, "which is out of the changed time plan."
Ancient Ole von Beust stayed in the middle of his previous statements, according to the Olympic Ambassador Hamburg at least 2028 nerealistics.
"No Hamburg, but German olympian sport smoking decides about the olympian candidate," said Van Beust news WELT ONLINE.
He showed that at the beginning of December 2018, the Sport Sport will decide on the Mnich Kandidator on the cycle games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan with 2028."
Although this dream hasn't ended yet, he said Van Beust.
Hambury Sport Sports (HSB) marked from Beusto's explanations for a positive policy.
It will be aware that Hamburk will not want to go out in the next 20 five years.
"It's still too quick to destroy the chance that the plans are already in this early phase, we're marked to be sepulched," said the president HSB, Hunter Ploss.
The explanation would be in contrast with the explanation of the senate boss that he brought to the valley assembly of the Universal Germany of the High-Sport Sports.
Von Beust has not published the Hamburg candidate in the United Nations in 2015 as a replacement for the order of olympian heroes.
The High School Sport Sports Hamburg first called a candidate city in the last week.
The SPD Fraction in Hamburg Parliament stated that a lot of price time that could be used to build lives in Hamburg.
"Kin Grasbrook's area was a Senate in March for a year, because he made an olympiad order and the building of the villages out," said the SPD Carol Veit and John Quast.
While the SPD for the area Klein Grasbrook still planned an olympian with that the whole area will be used later to live, the CDU is uniformly based on the "Olympian factor".
The exploitation of a flying olympian game in 2012 called his time in Hamburg a great overseer.
But the Hamburk's tracked on Lips.
It's not Warholov's crabs.
Those who join Swedish expressions and tree beds don't think of Andy Warhola, but Icue.
Or yes?
The trees produced in the present time in Sweden are set up on the list of Warhol's work of dark dark dark darkness.
Most of his list of 194 "Brillo box" types of Stockholm are falsific.
After the Swedish news "Expressen" a few months ago, the ability of Warhol's "Brillo boxs" from 1968, the internal research of the Museo Moderna Museum in Stockholm with the result of the Stockholm; six "Brillo boxes", which in 1995 the Museo Moderna Museet had given the gift of his former Director Pontus Hulten, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo box" Stockholm, which are in the international market of the Stockholm.
Previous events are occupied, mathematical string of art and curator actions.
Warhol his first Brillo boxes produced in New York in 1964, decreased tree beds based on the red white design of the paper box of the mysterious Brillo.
The exhibition of his work in Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo bed from the carton. They didn't go from Warhola, but they were added directly from Brillo tower.
It wasn't about a single work, but about their proposals, only an explicit cook.
Warhol, obviously, was also authorized in 1968 to produce several trees of Brillo beden in Sweden, but they are not established in Moderna Museet.
Then the witnesses are now talking about fifteen beds that at the time they entered in the officer and audit story as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were delivered for more than 1000,000 dollars.
The problem is now expected that the legal director of Pontus Hultén later stated falsely that in 1968 he was produced in Sweden and was set nearly one hundred beans, which was left to him Warhol.
In fact, 105 Hulten bodies were produced in Malmö for the building in Petrohrad first in 1990.
At that time Warhol was three years after death.
Lars Bystrom, the top concert Moderna Museet, studied except six Brillo boxes that are in the museum property, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collections, two of which were prepared in Sweden in 1968 and after their overclocks of basic colours and clouded, were a hole in the middle of white oil.
From the structure of the copy of 1990, the color was without the preceding basic cloud of the small role on the slide, except about the acryl and not on the oil color.
"These beds were not authorised by the art and should be authorized from Warholov's official list of Brillo boxs", left the director Moderna Museum, Lars Nitve: "If the organisation of Andy Warhol Art Authentiation Board in New York is not going to other concluders, Moderna Museet must have six beans from its collections to classify as "existent material - cope".
In July, the Authority Board stated that those "sharing offences" which were taken in the cases of the crab with a cycle, would be busy.
However, the organization continues to be able to be insufficient.
Rebeling soldiers in Manile are replaced
At the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who attended a hotel in Manile and requested the presidency of Glorie Macapagal Arroy.
Leader of Antonio Trillanes, who denied the president of manipulation and corruption in choices, said to the reporters in the hotel that he refused to be responsible for blood.
The military soldiers have bought the government before, with the establishment of a lot of plots on the hotel.
A few hours ago, about two ten soldiers were in the building.
