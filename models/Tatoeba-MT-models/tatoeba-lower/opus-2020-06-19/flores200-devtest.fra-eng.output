This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor in relation to what she had needed before.
The origin population has not changed everything, she always needs the same adaptations.
During the time, as the new population is adapted to its new environment, it begins to appear at least at least to the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two population will appear so different that they can't be considered as part of the same species.
We call this process "specion", which means just the training of new species. The specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of the evolution.

The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes the reserve of expressed variables.
The collection and recombination change the variations between both basins to each generation.
In the savany, it is difficult for a digestive system to satisfy the needs of humans in amined acids from available vegetable resources.
Furthermore, an absence of reaction has severe consequences: growth, malnutrition and finally death.
The most easily accessible veterinary resources would be the proteins contained in the sheets and leomineus, but these are difficult to digestion for primates like us, less than being cooked.
In opposition, the food of animal origin (fourmis, termite, eggs) is easy to digging everything by bringing a large quantity of proteins refering all animal admin acids.
However, we should not be surprised if our own elders have resolved their “protein problems” a little of the same way as the cympanisation of the savany is today.
The interruption of the dream is the process that consists in the intensive age during your dream period and the supply of a little after (10-60 minutes).
This can be made easy using a relatively silent reveal to make you a consciousness without revealing you completely.
If you find to re-initialise the clock during your dream, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forced to get out of bed to exit it.
The other possibilities based on the biorythm include the fact of drinking many liquids before sleeping (including water or the tea, reputed to be diurétical), which contrarys you to wake up for urining.
The internal peace level of a person is opposed to the tension level in his body and his spirit.
More tension is low, more vital strength is positive. Everyone has the possibility of finding peace and absolute content.
The only thing that makes obstacle to this objective is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan buddhism is based on the teachings of Bouddha, but it has been enriched by the path of the Makayana love and by many technology of Indian Yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan buddhism is very simple. It is combined from Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (Lighting Energy) is opened by yoga steams, respiration exercise, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan Meditation Centre is the yoga of the deity. This is the view of various diets that the energy channels are cleaned, the active chacras, and the created weight consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures have finished the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, old aliates became enemies and frog war began.
She was going to end up for the next 40 years and would see real attacks, by the replacement army, on battle fields as well in Africa, as in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Poland Defence was already broken, and the only hope was to fight back and to reorganize the length of the head of the Roman Point.
But these plans have become obsolete on the next day, when more than 800 thousand soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union have arrived and created the Bielorruss and Ukraine's front after they have disappeared the regions is from Poland, violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Swiss-Poly-Agression Pacte, and other international treaty, that they are bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for market transport is the most effective means to move large people and goods through the ocean.
The work of the sea has been traditionally ensure that your country keeps the ability to move your people and your goods, while interfering with the ability of your enemy to move his people and their goods.
One of the most recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to travel Atlantic oceans to soldiers and materials to help the Great Britain.
At the same time, German sea, mainly using U-Boots, tried to stop this train.
If the Allians had failed, Germany would probably have conquered the British as she did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the chairs were first dominated for about 10,000 years ago in the mountains of Zagros in Iran.
Cultures and old tribes began to keep them near them to make easy access to the lake, the pool, the flesh and the pearls.
The home chambers were generally guarded in groups that were mistaken on collines or other pattern spaces, often dreamed by chiefs who were most of the time of children or adolescents, similar to the most known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods have always been running today.
The “wagonways ” were built in England since the XVIst century.
Although the paths for wagons were simply constituted of parallel tree plants, they allowed horses that took them to achieve greater speeds and to carry out more important charges than on the lately accidented streets of the day.
The crossillons have been introduced enough early to maintain the tracks in place, however, we have noticed that the tracks would be more efficient if they were mountained from a fire band on the top.
This has become a current practice, but the ferry has caused more use on the roads in the woods of wagons.
Finally, the wood routes were replaced by ferry roads. In 1767, the first rows made their apparatus.
The first way of location was the road: humans moved up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, Australians, did not walk as usually.
There are biped specializations in Australian fossiles from 4,2 to 3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus had been able to walk on two feet for seven million years.
We can begin by live in a better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even fight in the purpose of waiting for the sufferings to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomic treatment. However, if we don't want only a temporary solution, we must find the race of problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed much through scientific and technological progress made by human beings, and that problems have become more important because of overpopulation and extravagant life mode of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a manuscript project signed by the President of John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to some streets from there to John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 examples were made, today known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the court of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who made it read to his groups in New York on 9 July. A copy came to London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets who are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinoses has survived and is still alive. We call them birds.
Many people considered them as dinosaures that give them a lot and they can fly.
But there are many things on birds that look like a dinosaure.
They have packed pieces of scales and shoes, they put eggs and walk on their two patterns back like T-Rex.
Practicely all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information codified under binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
A internal imposition cannot be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as smokings, are sufficiently general for an immediate diagnosis cannot be placed.
The best index of an internal emergency is probably the presence of a open recipient of toxic chemicals or toxic chemical products.
See the label to know the instructions of first specific safeguards for this fishing.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this inject group.
This term comes from ancient familiarity with bed punishes, which are very adapted insects to parasize humans.
The reducts, as well as bed punishes, are nidicoles, are adapted to live in their host or lives.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 cases of sclerrose in plaques (SEP), which is actually the main neurological disease in young and average adults.
The sclerrose in plaques is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, the spinal mole and the optic nerve.
Researchs have shown that women are two times more susceptible to have the sclerose in plaques than men.
A couple can very appreciate that he is not in their interest, nor in the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make a project of adoption for their baby.
In the framework of an adoption, biological parents have finished their parents' rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific research.
However, it is not the only, the experience, and an experience is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to put questions and to comments, but also the scientific research.
Naturists and philosophy have focused on old texts, especially on the Bible in Latin.
The opinions of Aristote on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of the Greek knowledge, the West has found its philosophy and Greek scientists.
Many rithms observed in physiology and conduct are often depending on the presence of endogen cycles and their production by biological horlogs.
The periodic rithms, which are not only responses to external periodic stimulation, were documented for most lives, including bacters, fields, plants and animals.
Biological horlogs are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a functioning cycle for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
Hershey and Chase experience was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phases, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacteria.
They have sent two experiences to mark the DNA of the phase with a radioactive phosphor, or the protein of the phase with radioactive suffering.
Mutations may have many different effects according to the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material and if the cells affected are general cells.
Only the mutations of germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can cause the death of cells or cancer.
Ecotourism interests people who want to visit natural areas in order to benefit landing, in particular the fat and flower.
The chase, fish, photography, observing birds, park visit and study of information on the ecosystem are examples of activities on place.
For example, we can go to see, photographer and discover the orang-outans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small campaign towns to get to their workplace and grow others who will work in the campaign they come to leave.
In this dynamic transport ship, each one is in some way linked to a system of transport based on specific cars and support.
The science shows that this massive economy based on the carbon has delayed the biosphere of its stability that supported human development for two million years.
Everyone is part of the company and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, it is weird to hear so much claims about the quality of the water or the flow of pounds.
Why are the transport systems built out of such plains, why are they falling every day? Is the transport engineers simplely incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flux is the study of the movements of drivers and special vehicles between two points and interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the circulation flux because the conductor’s conduction cannot be predicted with an hundred percent of certainty.
Happyly, the drivers have tends to act in a reasonable coherent quarter, so the circulation flows are tendencies to have a reasonable coherence and may be represented matematically closely.
For better representation of the traffic flow, relations were established between the three main characteristics: (1) debit, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help planning, conception and running road installations.
Insects were the first animals to be involving. Their capacity to flee has allowed them to escape easierly to their enemies and to find more effectively from food and companies.
Most of the insects have the ability to reply their allies in the length of the body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide predators.
Today, the only insects that can't reply their allies are the dragons and the ephemers.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarque said that the sun system was moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed that the sun system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't have the pressure of move, isn't it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the largest river of the planet, sometimes 10 km of wide.
Not less than 20% of the water that goes out of the planet in the oceans are from Amazon.
The main arm of Fleuve Amazon is 6 387 km long (3 980 miles). He collects the water of thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramides is continued until the end of the Old Empire, Gizeh's pyramides have never been overwhelmed by their size and technical greatness of their building.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were surprised by the monuments of their predominators, which were so much more than thousand years.
The Vatican counts about 800 inhabitants, and it's the less undependent country in the world, and the less worried.
The Vatican City regulates its legislation and its official communications in Italy.
It is also the language of every day used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonys.
The Vatican City citizens are all Catholics.
Since the antiquity, people are familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, money and cow, because they are in the nature under brute shape and are enough easy to minize in the help of primitive tools.
Aristote, a philosophy, had theory that everything is constituted a measure of one or more of the four elements. He was from the earth, water, air and fire.
It was more than four of the matters (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also has ejected the theory according to which these lasts are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
The alliages are essentially a measure of two metals or more. Do not forget that the periodic table belongs to many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also aliases that include a small quantity of non-metallic elements, such as the carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of material. All materials are made of small atoms.
Atoms are so increasingly small than billions of them could enter the period at the end of this phrase.
So, the crayon was a good friend for many people when he was out.
Unfortunately, the appearance of new editing modes has set the style to a more confidential state and more rare use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and never have to approach a cross size.
We can only ask what the keyboard will happen when the next new will happen.
The fission bomb functions according to the following principle: it transforms the energy by assembling a neighbour of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A little bit as if we've made a colline to a big chart, divided the noise again, then freeing a little of this energy.
Some atoms have an instable neighbour, so they are trying to break up with a little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is constituted of stones and pools. His outside bed is called the crowd.
The crowd scatter is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It's more fine at the level of the sea and more space under the continents.
It may have more marriage on the near side because the crowd is more finished. It was easier for the lake to go back to the surface.
The theories of the content are focused on the research of what people feel well or they are attacked.
These theories suggested that people have some needs and/or desires that have been internalized in the road and in measure of their maturation to adult age.
These theories examine what some people want to do and what they do in their environment, they do or don't do some things.
Two popular content teories are the theory of Maslow's needs and the theory of the two factors of Herzberg.
In general, two behaviors can suffer when a manager becomes the chief of old colleagues. From one of the extremists of the spectro is trying to stay “the good copy” (or the good girl).
This type of manager is bad to take imperative decisions, to take disciplinary actions, to make assessments, to trust responsibilities, and to keep others as responsible.
On the other side of the spektrum, one becomes an unknown person who feels that it/she must change everything that the group has created to others and do things in his way.
After all, the boss is responsible for the success and loss of the team.
This behaviour is often disputing between leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams are submitted to the same excellence standards as the conventional teams, but there are different differences.
Members of a virtual team often work as a point of contact of their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can be gathered together in accordance with different hours, which can not be included by their local direction.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the guide team to which each member gives its accounts. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would a organization make the fast creation process of a learning structure? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional services of an organization, creativity and inensitivity may be completely expressed.
Therefore, the process of a working organization together to override an obstacle can lead to a new unnoving process to respond to the need of the customer.
Before a organization is not innovative, its direction must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the continuum approach as an employed method to help organizations to get better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theorical approach to the study of cognition, which allows them to reduce the research field and to make it more precise.
Correlation between the cerebral pathology and the comportament supports scientists in their research.
It is known for a long time that various types of dommages, lessons, tumors and cerebral traumatism affect the behavior and changes in some mental functions.
The new technologies we can see and study structures and cerebral processes that have never seen before.
This gives us many information and materials to build simulation models that help us to understand processes in our mind.
Although the Artificial Intelligence often is strongly known by science-fiction, it represents a very important part of computer sciences who study the conduct, learning and intelligence adaptation of a machine.
The research in artificial intelligence has to automatize machines required a smart approach.
The examples include the control, planning and programming, the capacity to respond to the diagnosis and the questions of customers, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to different disciplines, assessed on the contribution of solutions to the problems of the day-time life.
The AIA system is then often used in the areas of economic, medicine, engineering and army, as it has been placed in several home computers and video games.
The excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to bring his students in places where a bus travel is not visible.
The solution is brought by the technologie under the form of virtual educative sorrows. Students can look at the old objects of a museum, visit a aquarium, or admire a super work of art at the rest of sitting with their class.
Practically participating in a excursion is also a great way to think about a travel and share his experiences with future generations.
For example, students of Bennet school in North Caroline consist every year of a website dedicated to their visit to the capital of the State. Every year, the site is updated, but old versions are stored online to use albums.
The blogs can also help students to improve their reaction competences. Even if students often try the experience of the blog with a grammar and a negative orthography, the fact that a public has generally developed the situation.
As students often are the most critical public, the author of the blog begins to improve his writing to disappear critics.
Furthermore, the fact that the blogger “obtains students to know the world who around them” is needed to excite the interest of the public to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blogs are a tool that stimulate cooperation and encourage students to improve their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"In fact, the blogs " can allow students to strengthen their analysis and critical spirits: in effect actively on online contents, they can compare their opinion to others and expose their own views on well-specific subjects" (Oravec, 2002)."
