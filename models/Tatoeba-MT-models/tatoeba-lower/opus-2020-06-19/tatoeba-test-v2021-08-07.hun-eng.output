I promise we'll see you soon.
I asked her hand.
I pressed a bad button.
I'll make a coffee.
I'm gonna make a coffee.
I've got it.
I've got a boat.
I've got it on Sunday.
I put the rest in the room.
I've put the food in the pigs.
I'm so quickly kidding.
I want to look back to my words that have been turned into other languages.
I've been running to the station this morning.
I fucked as I just got it, but I've got the last line.
I got out.
I got your brother in the street.
I refused my mom.
I'm reading a book during the eating.
I'm reading the levels.
I read a lot of rain.
I read in some books.
I read this story in some book.
I appreciate your cooperation.
I don't really know where to begin.
I'm saying I don't trust him.
I don't really trust.
I really don't want to do that.
I've been very good tonight.
I really like to be alone.
I really like the city's life.
I really like the eggs, I really like this week in the year.
That's why I'm going to go for the kitchen.
I really like your wedding.
I got a letter from your mother last night.
I've got your letter unexpectedly.
I got your message.
I've met a old friend recently.
I knew your face.
I recommend you to learn to French.
I was excited as a paradise.
I refused the advice.
I'm sorry I've visited Australia.
It's a party.
I remember both of you.
I'll remember that.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom took a barna fish.
I reminded him of the obligation.
I appreciate Tomit.
For four years, I'm gonna be quiet.
I made my shoes on your car.
First, put these rings out.
I'm going to follow you quickly.
I'll run eight kilometers on the day.
Fuck.
I raised the horses, sir.
I said that, but I didn't think seriously.
I said it wouldn't be good.
I didn't tell you.
Thank you.
I'm sitting and scared.
I've been at the room.
I've seen to think.
I was sitting in thinking.
I was sitting near the shooter.
My paradise is fruit or green?
I'm sitting on the ground.
I've seen a driving car.
I've seen a smoke with a driver.
I saw a very good movie last weekend.
I saw Dan.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw it.
I saw John in the book.
I saw more than Tom knows.
I saw one.
I saw something.
I saw it.
I've seen the car's robbery.
I saw them.
I saw Tomit to dance with another girl.
I saw Tamas today.
I saw your name on the list.
I shoot the shooter.
I've hoped that it's gonna happen in secret.
I've done a photograph.
I pictured him in secret.
I'm seeing a house.
I'm seeing a Russian.
I'm seeing a boyfriend and a woman.
I'm looking at Ritkan.
I'm seeing this.
I understand what you think.
I've signed a risk.
I sent you a shoe.
I've served with Tom for special forces.
I made the table on the sixth part.
I've planned six.
Everybody's okay?
Everybody's here?
No, Tommy, you're not so important.
It's all right in the office.
Is everything ready?
The fast eating is really insanitable?
Is France harder than English?
Is it difficult for French excuses?
In your schools, are you teaching French language?
Did you call France?
- Youtube's a crime?
Is he sick or doctor?
Americans?
Sir?
Is he my friend?
Is he high?
I got a hand with Tom, and I went.
I made my head.
I should go there.
I should first ask Tom.
I needed to help Tom.
I should have been a movie.
I should have been on the meeting.
I should have been there at the meeting.
I should have been more complicated.
I should have been more precious.
I should have been lower.
I should have been there soon.
I had to get more food.
I should first come here.
I should have done that last week.
I should have done this in somewhere else.
I should have done it with you.
I should have helped Tom to do that.
I never had to come to Boston.
I didn't have to say anything.
I should have told you to do it.
I should have seen that's coming.
I should have stayed out of it.
I had to try something else.
You didn't have to leave me alone.
I should have paid this.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I'm not feeling it.
I'm calling, but nobody hears.
I just want to know what this is about.
Is this a bird?
Are you okay if I call Tom?
That's a fucking damn?
Is it fair in Germany?
Is that dangerous?
Is it easy to learn to speak as an expert?
Finished?
Will you eat tomorrow?
It's hard to speak English?
Is that an obligation?
Is that normal?
Isn't it okay if I'm sitting here?
Is it?
Is that too late?
Isn't that Tom followed a suicide?
Isn't that Tom killed you?
Are you sure you've been learned for a week?
Is that true that you've been raised to Tommy's girlfriend?
Are you sure you like the soil coffee?
It's a bad time?
The fruit is better payable than the coffee?
I'm taking it, I'm on the ground.
Laurie Dunde?
I'm sleeping with two couples.
After half night, I was sleeping with one hour last night.
I was sleeping. I've been late from school.
I've been sleeping for nine hours.
I've been grateful to the chief.
I've broken the pocket.
Mary Tom's mother?
I'm a cigarette.
The week's gonna be good?
Do I understand?
I picked a picture.
I was in the house.
I went into the house.
I've been amazing.
Are you responding now?
Didn't you have enough to destroy my life?
Well, isn't it a medicine?
I gave it on my day.
Sometimes I'm sorrowful.
Sometimes I'm hurt.
I'm sleeping sometimes.
Is Paris a long time?
I'm talking about a little southern.
I'm talking to a little explain.
I'm talking a little.
I'm talking a little.
I'm talking to a bit of rush.
I'm talking to a bit of rush.
I'm talking about a little Russian.
I'm just talking to French every day.
I'm talking to French and English.
I'm talking in Spanish.
I was with him all the day.
I was with them all day.
I got all my money.
I got all my money.
I got all the money I was just to take the book.
I was crazy for one hour until I came to know where to go.
I've finished the start of my life in the incubator.
I've finished my life's beginning in the incubator.
I've met with my friends the lunch.
I guess I've got a gubbassed all day before my machine.
I've seen three years for a sin that I didn't follow.
I've seen three years for what I didn't follow.
I've been talking for a long time.
A cytruscreen for my bread.
Can the water be able?
Is Russia part of Europe or Asia?
Is she so important?
Is she your mother?
Are you very close to Scicia Mount?
I've broken papers all day, and I'm hungry now.
I started trying to make it in the truth.
I stayed.
The tea's sweeter than the tea?
Is it enabled?
That's the fucking kid?
Secrets?
Is that right?
Is that a purpose?
The air is on the picture or there's a photograph?
The air is on the picture or on it?
Is this my hair?
Did you get this in the middle?
Is that a problem for you?
Is this a real money?
Is there a scientific basis for this?
Did you tell anything like that?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is this the problem?
Right?
But that's true?
Everybody wants this?
The ball is in the shadows or under it?
You clean the part?
Is that bad?
Is the microphone connected?
The music is open today?
Do you have doctors on the feeding?
Do you have a free place?
Is there a metro in your city?
There's a reception here?
Is there any doubt?
Is there any more of this?
Is there something between you?
Is there something else you want to know?
I need something to do?
You want to say something, Tom?
Is there?
Do you have a free seat?
Do you have life before death?
Is there something you want better?
Is there a ruler in Iran?
He's alive, or is he dead?
This is the kid, or the girl?
Is that a dream?
Is that ethical?
Is this a fault?
Is this alive?
Is that an electronic?
Is that a vendor?
That's it?
Is this my place or yours?
Is that really alcohol?
Is this the Jankovich Tamas?
Are you free of this seat?
Is that right?
Is that a lot of impressive tree?
Is that something that wants to be an insectable trip?
Is that so hard to understand?
Is this the key you're looking for?
Is that valuable?
Is this your home system for you?
You call this home system?
Is she your girlfriend?
Is that your money?
I don't remember anything yet.
I can't tell you why.
It was seven or eight years old, exactly where you were?
I don't understand anything yet.
I don't even know why you did.
I've got a lot of time to break up.
There's one or two things left to do in your board.
I'm gonna have to celebrate the morning.
I think this is the best choice.
The Christian Tom?
Tom's okay?
Tom's a good kitchen?
Tom's a good teacher?
Is he?
- Tom American? - No, Canadian.
I don't know, I'm gonna call and ask you.
Tom died?
Is Tom?
Tamas's left?
Is Tom disappeared?
Tom Mary's son?
Tom's ready?
Is Tamas still sick?
I stayed.
I bought you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I'm teaching two hours every day.
I'm stuffing in school.
I'll suggest, talk to Mari.
I'll suggest you to talk to Tom.
I think you've been busy and are ready to get up.
I'm sure I've heard this sound in somewhere.
I swear that you're damned for that.
I'm usually crazy.
Two and a half miles in the day.
Does your daughter feel better?
You're doing a dangerous job?
Your mother's home?
Your mother's home?
Due isn't worth it.
This affects everyone.
There's no end until we're not too much on it.
I'll take her place.
I'm going to work every day.
I've talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's just on you.
It's gone out of nothing.
You can be better with your sister.
This goes together with the love I feel against you.
It's a lot more than I've been telling it.
These two euros are the price.
Maybe a problem.
Maybe love.
I'd like to see all the jobs.
It's obviously crazy.
Don't shoot it.
I wasn't bad.
That wasn't much helped.
He didn't have the ship.
He wasn't staying there.
Let's just let you come.
You're not doing anything.
Everything who started and why.
It seems not so funny.
It doesn't seem right.
I'm learning Chinese language.
It's like you wouldn't have been on me.
I've just found that I've lost her.
It's called the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for my trust.
This happened at the beginning of the last week.
This point happened on our marriage day, honey.
He had some reason to be that.
It's not happening.
That happened when he was out.
He's done more time with me.
Sometimes it's going.
They're all eating.
It's not good.
He's got his own value.
The rain is fallen from the rain.
I think every man should be disease.
I think everyone's hungry.
I think she can't help you.
I think you're gonna be fine with your neighbors.
I'm gonna find her weakness.
I think you've got some movies.
I think I can.
I think I'd be unbelievable to kill.
I don't think I couldn't kill.
I think I don't understand.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll take Tom.
I think I'm dead.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I've seen a pocket.
I think I'm still time to do it before Tom is here.
I think it's better.
I think it's right.
It's very small to the reality, I think you're going to do it from yourself.
I think he's going.
I think it's time for a carrier change.
I think it's time to keep a break.
I think it's injustice.
I think that's right.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mary.
I think it'd be better if you'd go now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor could die.
I think you're gonna be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's okay.
I'll find the pockets.
I think she's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think you should forget that.
I think it's gonna make it all.
I think I'm drinking.
I think I'm here.
I think there's no sense we're trying to guarantee her.
I think they've done a good job.
I think you're just gonna want Tom.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this doctor's gonna make you good.
I think the time will resolve this problem.
I think Tom was there already.
I think Tommy's happy.
I think Tom's still without work.
I think Tom's really hungry.
I think Tom might be older to me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom can help.
I think it's Tamas.
I think we'll trust him.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we've gone back to a bad direction.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I think you're all crazy now.
I think you called a bad number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what is the name of Tamas's friend.
I think you're gonna leave it.
I think you're looking great.
I think it'd like you.
I think you've missed it.
I think you should go personally.
I think you're the best girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you've got a nice dream.
I don't think you weren't satisfied.
I think you were right.
I thought to Tom.
I thought if we were going to eat somewhere, it was a lie.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be something.
I thought I couldn't understand what I want.
I thought my head was broken.
I thought my future.
I've had a good idea to keep the key under the football, but it wasn't proved.
I thought Tommy still lived in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom's still home.
I thought you were him.
I've rejected the neighborhood to kill him.
It's hurt!
It's hurt.
I'm standing under the effect.
He had a great effect on me.
It's dangerous.
It's a story color.
It's hard to move to the treatment that he said.
It's hard to go everybody in love.
It's hard for everyone to make love.
I've got two things because I'm going to work.
You're starting to be so late.
He's gone.
We're half hours after half night.
Some people are hard to understand.
The first time you're starting in a new company.
It's important to promote our language in all possible ways.
Actually your faults.
He's in the cow.
Great!
It's south.
This is my network room.
We need to be ready for the future.
You need a good calm.
I've never learned too late.
I'm happy to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
It can't be disabled.
This isn't the best solution.
This isn't the right solution.
You don't have to say he's a jealousy.
That's not your secret.
I'm not the one who has Tom's problem.
Not so sweet.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
He doesn't work.
Maybe she's lying.
It's not gonna be a lot of talking.
It's flying.
He still moves.
Oh, it's very bad today!
Sweet baromi!
Thirty meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's a too easy task for him.
You're coming in.
It's a useful information.
It's great night.
It's very important that you put your hands on the base after you broke up your baby's arms.
He just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It's gonna be dark to go home.
You'll be ready when you need.
It's gonna be ready for the time you need.
It's gonna be a little time to attach to the shoes.
He's gonna get down soon.
It's gonna work if I get the polarities.
The next seems to be greater.
It looks good.
Looks like it doesn't need me here.
You'd like a wine change.
Looks like you don't feel something good here.
Looks like you thought about everything.
That's crazy to me.
That's important.
It may be a long time.
Maybe it's a shit.
This can save your life.
Maybe we'd be happy if we'd try.
Maybe I'll be late.
You gotta go.
You need to report something.
I was sure I was loved.
They're really locked.
You have to admit it.
He never existed.
I never had to happen.
Instead, I lied to him that I didn't want.
I told him I'll do the best possible.
I told her to come.
I told Tominak not to give it up.
I told Tom where I took my bicycle.
I told you, but you didn't hear me.
I said I'm fine.
I told you you don't go ahead.
I told you three weeks.
I told you to love you, Tommy.
I would have a question for me too.
I've lost a lot of time.
I've been in your cave for a long time.
I've got it.
I went on the 58th way.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my car in the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my kids.
I forgot that.
It'd probably be more slower than somewhere.
You've got the rain last night.
Yesterday.
It's a lot.
I'll eat two hours on the day.
I've broken the whole Russia.
I put the United States in a cross-shirt-shirt.
He's actually working.
That's really crazy.
I've been trying to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tominak.
I've got my life too.
I'm trying to keep out of it.
I'm trying to share my thoughts.
That's a great roller.
Great maddy.
It's a little time for the drink, isn't it?
It's an unbelievable word.
It's a nice situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least.
A green rock building.
It's a household dog.
It's half hours.
It's a crazy day.
It's a cooking.
It's full of darkness.
That's all mine.
It's all right.
That's a beautiful and good idea, but is it going to work in this practice?
That's all your fault.
It's seven hours ago.
He's already in the process.
There's ten hours ago.
I've always been one of my songs that I've lived at a piece.
It's always the same note.
A range catastrophe.
It's a business, Watson, a business, a dangerous business, and what I'm going to see, it's a lot of pleasure.
What a shit!
It's all I've got.
It's like Tommy's gone.
It's a lot of strangers.
It's a smoke.
It's a jerk.
It's just such a artist as science.
That's the last time.
He's in school.
A very dangerous sport where a little mistake can lead to a serious grief.
It's a very old book.
Financial shipping.
Great question.
That's horrible.
It was a damn week.
It was a long day.
It was a wonderful travel.
This day's funny.
It's a hard day today.
It happened before.
It wasn't any seven.
Two years ago, she left.
That's better.
Better night to put the garden.
Firefore.
Yes.
It's better to get in a bus.
It's for me Chinese.
It's locked on the Sunday.
It's closed for a day.
Saturday's closed.
It's closed on Sunday.
He's hot home.
It's hot, I'm a library.
It's hot.
Why don't you get a ball?
He knew that he loves the figs.
It's all that Tom did or not.
It's totally normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep.
That's great!
It's ready!
It's not easier to start than to leave it.
It's easy to be a messian brother.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Marit.
I looked like a eternal ability.
It seems that the bus was cut off.
It sounds totally convinced.
Looks like it was just last night we went to school together.
It seems that it wasn't changed.
It's very weird.
It seems like it.
Looks like she's lying.
Looks like Tom isn't smoking.
Like you don't want this to come to me.
Looks like you're honorable.
It looks like you're smoking.
It seems we're going to be an outside.
I'm trying to get out of a randy.
They just want that.
Baby.
It's just if you get the same payment for the same job.
Not closely perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
That's yours.
You know, it's funny.
Let's go.
Let's get ridiculous.
It's gonna be hard for us.
It's not easy.
Good luck to see the balls.
It's good to be funny.
It's good for learning.
It's nice that he could come.
You're sure you're gonna call it.
It's not hard to do this conclusion.
It's hard to believe that he was clean and day.
It's hard to write.
It's hard to find a foot in this city to sleep.
It's hard for you.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to shoot a bitch.
Of course it's good.
He's a big head in orderlessly.
Yours.
The kids are already in bed.
Stay with the money.
He's more slower than the shooter tonight.
That's injustice.
That's important.
It is important that parents stay on one side when the row gets a child.
It's important to help the problem.
That's impossible for me.
You have to finish here.
You can't get a aircraft in here.
Unconsciousness to respond to your expectations.
It's impossible to make your conditions.
I don't know what to get tomorrow.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's impossible.
It's inspiring.
It's just one of them.
It's just better.
It's just time to ask Tom's gonna be a problem again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's too hard.
That's too important.
It's really good for you to get home.
I love you're saying that.
It's later.
There's a smoke today.
It's like a field of the sea, and the teacher, it's on it, and it's like a aircraft creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's a lot like he lives.
It's too hurry for the smoke.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
That's my shirt.
Now the line is on me.
You're never late to be what you could.
There's nothing with you.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not so serious as it sounds.
It wasn't amazing.
That's not enough.
It's not going to do it.
You're not going to change Egypt.
That's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negotiated.
There's no longer.
It's not so simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what you see.
It's not what you're doing, but how you're doing.
You can't worry about her.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
You don't understand the priest if you don't testify your sin.
There's no sense to disturb the past.
It's a fuck.
Obviously he's broken.
Of course it is impossible.
Obviously weird.
Of course it's very painful.
It's not worse if some of them keep better.
It's okay if the man's gone.
— Three months ago, and Tommy says he's still talking about France. — Yes, he's in the crazy sky. — How cute? — Dunning-Kruger effect.
Just three days.
The park's on the other side.
It sounds good.
It's over, right?
It's over.
It's personal.
I'm happy as if you're from the disease.
He spreads out his grounds.
It's very amazing.
It's amazing.
It's easy.
It is sufficiently clear that the objective of this mini-centropic minds has been opened in the exploitation of the employment class, raising the imperialism from the responsibility of blood-building wars, and that the unfinite wars have been born with humans.
Yeah, it's just smoking.
The rain is in my heart.
It's a little big time in Japan.
Isn't it?
That's really a big number.
It's once.
I don't want to ask someone who's looking for.
They say the girls are beautiful.
They say they're going to leave Tokio.
Shit!
It's easy.
It's here.
It's in Boston now.
That's good to stay home!
He still moves.
It's self-sexuality.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've been reading.
That's the less I can do.
Of course it's possible.
That's the same for everyone.
It's the same old problem.
You need to answer it.
It's time we're getting our tents.
Let's go out of here.
It's time we're going.
Time!
It's time to do the problem.
I'm gonna have to get my hair.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell me the whole truth.
The first time we're gonna do something about this.
Tom's the birthday today.
This is Tom's decision.
Tomi is in contrast to Mari's words.
It's too dark for us to stay.
That's lovely for me.
Now it's too late for this.
It's later.
It's later to worry about it.
It's a typical time.
The worst thing is fair.
It's a round, a ridiculous shirt, and no harmony, but at least it's not in the darkness.
It's under the table.
Maybe it's not so stupid as you think.
It's not probably something serious to happen.
Now it's depending on them.
You're trying to go there or not.
It's very funny.
It's very crazy.
It's very hot in this room, right?

More than a month, I've been healed from the wound.
Tom had to choose a couple of kids for a long time.
He had a long time, but finally he could find it.
I turned back to a little cycator.
I got it.
I'm turning to the left.
It was a beautiful birthday.
It was a hard time.
It's a barita's confusion.
It was a trial to do it.
It was a good bullet.
It was a short half night.
It was a real call.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
That was a tragedy balance.
It was really good to eat.
It was just a time-speak for all of us.
It was very strange.
It was a wonderful day.
It was wonderful tonight.

First, it was hard.
It was unexpected.
He was fucking and weak.
It was fuel, it was a parking time.
It was just a kidney.
It was too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It's been an hour.
This wasn't much before John had a idea, but John always knew a sight of the unexpected situations.
It wasn't a very interesting winner.
It wasn't easy for me.
I didn't have to keep my promise.
That was a plot in the wind.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who put the door in.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't target.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't so bad.
It wasn't the first time they did it.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just funny.
I just knew the real purpose when I met him.
It's not hurt.
It was last night.
It was too weird.
That was really interesting.
He was really quick.
It was really crazy.
I'm sure.
That was great.
I could just think about that.
The worst pain I ever met.
Tom followed him.
They were totally held in secret.
It was unbelievable to get her married.
That was amazing.
A few days after the end.

He'll eat a week if he's not staying tomorrow.
This town's gonna be worthy of the town.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do it anymore.
You won't take a lot of time.
He worked greatly.
It's perfectly working with your iPhone.
It would be dangerous.
It would be the other one.
We're going to get out of here.
It would be unbelievable.
It would have been better if it had been done.
It wouldn't be courageous, but stupid.
It would be better if we didn't do it.
I submitted Tom.
I got it.
I understand that it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I understand what you're talking, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I get what you're saying, but it's not sex.
I understand your problem.
I broke up my software.
I need a job right now.
Maybe I could, but not now.
I was old married.
I've been drinking a lot of colds before, but now I'm just drinking water.
I had a dog.
Maybe I lived with a park.
Sometimes I lived in a park neighborhood.
I wanted to smile, my favorite sport in the middle school.
I didn't eat meat before.
I was sleeping before I saw my grandmother and my grandfather.
I've been working in a restaurant.

I've got it behind the shoes.
I've got something before you.
I've been happy waiting for the arrival.
I've been looking for you.
I wasn't in one of these places.
I was under great pressure in the last time.
I'm waiting for a hour of the bus.
I was waiting for the appropriate time.
Wait for you.
I chose her to my wife.
I decided to go with you.
I decided to connect to your own firewaters.
I've removed my call.
Sometimes I did it.
I'm going to get out of here.
Finally.
I forgot the name of the driver.
I have my wife and children.
I've got shoes, and they're very shooting.
It's in the car store of my gita.
I've got a relief.
I've already added this climate.
I wanted him very much.
I need to be ready.
I gotta go.
I remember Tom and Mary.
I'm forgot Tomit.
We had enough food.
I heard everything.
I've made it up, I've got it, and I've got it.
I learned so much about Tom.
I lost all my friends.
My dream is gone.

I wasn't in Arizona yet, but I don't really know where he is.
I've never been in Paris.

I have no reason to believe him.
I don't have any reason to trust him.
I don't have fear.
I opened the kids on the bus, Mom waits for them in the wall in the bus.
I thought again.
I saw him with my own eyes, and I heard him my own ear.
I've seen my father's grave.
I've spent my money.
I've been recorded to my unit, and then I'm gonna get to learn as a shooter.

I want you to understand me in the ball.
I want you to stay here, lady.
I warned Tomit.
I've got it again.
I started to work when he stopped the phone.
I was in my dream.
I was lying in my dream.
I was crazy that I trusted Tommy.
I'm afraid I'm never gonna see her anymore.
I was afraid I've never seen anymore.
I was alone.
You missed me.
I missed you already.
I've been hungry.
I worked as a training for two years.
I was a lot... and then I've got it.
I was a good way... and I'm kidding.
I was sleeping.
Tom arrested me like you.
I was a lot.
I was with her yesterday.
I was with my mother.
I was with my dad.
I was with my parents.
I was one of my classmates.
I was in Mozi.
I was sleeping from the dream.
I've come to the world in Mexico on March.
I was born in 1977.
I was born a farmon.
I was born in a ship.
I've been crazy.
I'm talking about it.
I'm here from what he said.
After 20 years, they've been broken.
I've been so nice that I've pressed the bed a week.
They've been able to write the conscience.
I've been a little sleeping myself.
I've gone to Gyalog.
I was ready to do this.
I was happy yesterday.
I had a lot of dreams, so my friend gave me a dream.
I was here, but you didn't.
I was here at the point at 10:00, but you didn't.
I'm moving my hands.
I was invisible in the past year.
I hope you might know.
I hope Tom's going home.
I was in YouTube and I didn't do anything.
I was in Boston when this happened.
I walked in Rome.
I was in the hospital three weeks.
I was just at the post.
I'd have started write a letter when I'd go home.
They're cut off.
I've been after the meeting.
I've just made a smoke.
I was married at that time.
He started the story.
I was naiv.
He's just hit a car.
I was very interesting.
First, I was interesting, but then I've been quiet.
I hadn't needed anymore.
I couldn't answer a question to the test.
I wasn't born here, but I grew up here.
I didn't worry.
Then I wasn't ready for it.
I didn't sleep.
I didn't think.
I was one of the best students.
I'm just lucky.
I was in the bus.
I was in the list.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've been so funny.
I've been happy for your e-mail.
I could have been busy.
I was in Boston.
He made me a lot of trouble to see the movie after the book.
I was really busy.
I was really happy.
I was very surprised that he worked.
I was very surprised when it happened.
I'm sitting on Bring.
I was right for that, and Tommy's stealed.
I was afraid you might leave.
I was beaten, I stayed home all day.
I'm sorry.
I was sitting in Bern at the free office when a special idea arrived: if a man is free, he doesn't feel his own gravity.
I'm sitting at Tom.
I couldn't talk to you.
I stayed behind.
Then I was home.
I've stayed 30 minutes in the midnight.
He surprised what I knew.
She surprised that I found the door open.
I was surprised when I knew that Tom was French.
They learned that I'm first smoking and then I'm just asking.
I was the best man in the world.
I was the last one I saw him.
I was the only one who didn't call it.
I was the only one who lived in life.
I was there before to get a good place.
I was in the way.
I'm glad.
They were like a kid.
I tried to sleep.
I was very hard.
I'm afraid he's walking through all my porcicles.
I walked in London's streets.
They warned me not to believe what Tom says.
I was in Tommy yesterday.
I was with you.
I wrote a letter.
I've been involved with this.
I was a boyfriend and a lot.
I'm going back to my throne.
I'm going to get away.
I've been reading more.
That's what I'm going to do.
I slept the night later.
I went to Boston with a car.
I went to Canada.
I went to the ground last night.
I've gone outside.
I checked it.
I'm staying for two nights.
I'm coming when the time is allowed.
I'm sure there in your taste.
I'll do anything for you.
I'll do everything I can do.
I'm gonna miss this shit, you're sure you'll be in it.
I'll give you a bicycle on your birthday.
I'm going to report Tomit.
Let me choose.
You'll be missing all.
I'll understand Tomit.
I'm going to be low.
I'm gonna live too much.
I'll try again.
I'm waiting here until he comes.
I want you to come to the meeting.
I want him a good night.
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't fly.
Maybe I could fly.
I could just fly.
If I could fly.
Maybe I could do it alone.
I'd like to be a car.
Maybe I had a sign on the concert.
I wouldn't have seen such a crazy movie.
It would be for me too.
Although I would have learned harder in my young corner.
I'd like to know where he is.
I'd be a bird.
Although I could know so much as you.
If I could be smarter.
I wouldn't be like that.
If I could just be another thing.
Maybe my wife could be able to get out of here.
I'd like if we were a climate class.
I'd like Tom's going home.
I want a good way.
I want you to be a happy birthday.
You'll be here.
I wish you wouldn't look like he's very good.
Although you wouldn't be right, but I know you're right.
Although you'd have done it early tomorrow.
If you would let Tom end his story.
You wouldn't do that.
You wouldn't do that now.
I wake up.
I've been awakening.
I thought what Tom wanted.
I looked like that, if others look like me.
I'm thinking how I could do better.
Maybe it's going to the quantity.
I'm asking that it works.
Do you get the time tomorrow?
Is he married?
Does he have a easier way for this?
Is there a man named Tamas here?
I'm asking if Tom is here tomorrow.
I'm asking what happened to Paula.
What did the fucking guy want to do with this?
I look like the sun or the Hood is the biggest.
I'm asking if Tom can come or not.
Who hit this here?
Who can be responsible?
Why could he ask?
Why is that so sweet?
I want to know why Tommy didn't come to Mari's bullet.
I've got it!
I'm not gonna be home today.
I'm not gonna come.
I'm not going to break out here.
I'm not going to try to go and do it, but if you don't.
I'm not going to try to go and do it, but if you don't.
I'm not gonna forget.
I'm not gonna tell them.
I'm not going to Boston.
I got the lot.
I'm not gonna help him anymore.
I don't let Tom go to Boston.
I win with your help.
I've seen the seed.
I took my best clothes.
I'm working as a bussoff.
I worked hard in the month ago.
I worked in Boston.
I worked too.
I'm working every day outside the Sunday.
My worker's long.
I'm working for my life, but I'm not living to work.
I'm working too much.
I'll suggest you get out of time to the airport.
If I'd be in your place, I would ask him.
I'd be crazy if I wouldn't tell him the truth.
I'd be stupid to tell him.
I would be more productive if I wouldn't lose my time on the Internet.
They love it.
I'll do it if it's more time for me.
I'd like it, I don't have time.
I'd go to the movie if I'd have time.
I've never met you.
I want to know why women live more than men.
I want to see it.
I'd like to keep talking to English.
I'd like to write more hundreds of words to Tatobean, but I have something.
I wouldn't be in respect of the Lord's will.
I would never say that.
I don't want to live there.
I wouldn't say that.
I wouldn't say that's right, and I wouldn't say that's wrong.
I don't want to work with Tom.
I don't want to make you a worried inside me.
I'd like to see it.
I'd like to get out of here.
I'm going to go with the bicycles, as if I don't do it.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same thing today.
I wouldn't get out today.
I want to stay home.
I would have said yes.
I would have waited.
I'll write a convention on my freedom.
I wrote a book.
