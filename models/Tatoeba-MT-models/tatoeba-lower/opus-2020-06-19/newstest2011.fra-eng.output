What's going on? CSSD didn't know Voldemort or a patch in Prague.
The new CSSD elections in the capital maries should appear to be surrounded by a real language barrier in order to understand the municipal Council with their old and new colleges of the ODS.
The current day.cz has "tested" the new members of the Municipal Advice of CSSD, to know whether they know the argument that was born during the last years in Maria, when they were partners of the current coalition that led to Prague.
The vocabulary code that Prague's political claim has set along the past year of the Master Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations and causes of the metropol.
It is surprised that it has been discovered that new elections do not understand well the knowledge of the terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I don't really know."
"I'm a young man in Prague policy, Lukas Kaucky, the culture in the test of the "parrain" vocabulary.
And in the context of the political veteran, Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf trio".
"This is the only expression of what you propose me to use."
If not, I don't use the architect.
From the vocabulary, such as the moderne.cz, published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-exectoral convention of the ODS, the edition has chosen six examples, in priority those who are linked to Prague Maria.
The socialists should explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf golf in Prague", to go to the patsy, "nur of buffet", "tray of the capital" and "cooling".
Three elections were agreed for the quiz, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who must lead the education in Prague in the future - first promised a treatment but then did not decline the phone.
The fifth election Peter Dolinek shortly refused the test.
"I don't care about all these things and how the representatives of the civil democracy are pleasant: I will not give my opinion."
"I'm now busy in the way we're going to understand in the framework of our programmes," he replied.
As we have already heard it, Lucas Kaucky would not appear to recognize in the above legend, which is the influence of Janousek on the businessers and friends of the ex-mair Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he's in the test is "the biggest golf golf in Prague."
"It's the white tunnel," said Kaucky and added immediately, "But I know the journals."
"I'm gonna have to pay a language course," pleasant you.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina, but also Lukas Plachy, he's rolled for the environment, knowing that the golf ring is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democratic socio-democratics know who really is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where to find the personality - he thinks about the meaning of "going to the passenger."
"I think it's going to a company," Plachy is ready to realize that it's from Janousek's seats.
At the same time, your Brezina reminds that he's taken his knowledge in place of journals and not from any vocabulary that he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no architecture law in the social democracy.
"I took a counsel with colleagues and it appears that we really have nothing of this guy."
"The names are in place sometimes using abstractions and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Partie, that the members of the Partie are called Hulda.
"He called me Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this," said Karel Brezina about surnames.
The ACTuel.cz day tested the name and it's going.
Elu Weinert is Papy for the members of the Partie or well the oldest friendly Petit, representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted the attention to him before the elections by the choices during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the little game".
The surnames are also the only ones that allow to employ inside the party the democratic society.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't love much to hear Hulda, but Akutel.cz has recorded another name for this president Pragois.
"Doctor of Matrake" reminds that Peter Hulinsky has received the title of the doctor in JUDr. to the brotherislava police academy.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of the "sorciers," has edited a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared sorciers have common treatments.
They are part of the old generation, they can't work for health reasons, they are free and don't have children.
The one who becomes "sorci√®re" is isolated to do not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has this destination very rarely."
"We don't judge young women in good health because they participate in the work and buy children," says a sister who is busy in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government decided to intervene against this innormal social measure.
He has edited a brochure that should help to limit the smoking to the sorcerers.
The case is a "hic".
"For 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso doesn't know reading," advertised the Die Standard quoted on the incident of the written education.
The accusation of surcellery is current in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman was decided after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with the pet that they had explored him.
This is the BBC server who has transmitted this information.
The criminals claim that he was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onctions has been inflammated in the contact of the woman.
The oil has flambe, it's gonna be, when the team wanted to "cast the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorciers" is approved by persons of all education levels.
The De Standard quoted a 42-year-old company of Burkina Faso: "The foods of human spirits have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso tries to reduce the challenge to the sorcerers, Gambia is not after the last year even saw the President himself to participate in it.
"The President Gambian Dzammi, after the death of his tante, has led a large chase to the sorcerers who, likely, would have participated in his death and would be efforted by the black magic to kill the President."
"From the calls of the near Guinea came to the Research, they brought to the presidential close to Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, men and women who were chosen to be able to dance in the villages of Gambia," indicated the organization "Amnesty International.
In the closement of the employed persons had to drink a potion based on plants on hallucinagene effects that had resulted in more of other effects on rentals and intests.
Two prisoners haven't survived there.
On international pressure, about a thousand people who were released freely.
Bakal's lottery: the pools are chaffing, he signed a higher loyalty.
A age imprisoning man went out by the door of the client center of the RPG Bty of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to praise in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a folder with three new location contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son who entered to purify a pain.
Deregularisation has increased the lead to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500, the son should regulate from the next year for a apartment 2+1 of the second category 4100 corners.
"And there is no hot water and the chauffing works for solid combustible," shows the deck on the new contract of his son's son the man who has the signature power.
"But I signed at even," explains he in anger and half resigned.
The Civil Association of Appartements BTYOKD.cz who described the new location conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises the locators to notify and wait until 7 December, the date where a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to call.
But the man reacts to it by a handgest.
"The one says this, the other said something else," brokening the surprises.
Ostrava's region becomes the lab of deergulation.
After the New Year, it is what the majority of the apartments in the Czech Republic expects that the loyalty does not correspond to the market price.
Update.cz has this reason to be decided to visit personally the "laboratory".
The RPG room at Havirovska street is one of the four of the Ostrava region and it is already full of March at 09.00 tomorrow.
Just near the door has a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "Lower 2011", is attached on the tactile screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number out of the camera.
You don't have the time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to light on the great screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction, it's your tour.
After a short time, a old couple comes to learn about the loyalty, but new loyalty seems not to be concerned with people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to regulate current problems as part of all - requests of repairs, events on security and others.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44000 people in the RPG portfolio have e-mails with the new ball contracts in their box from middle November.
RPG Bty proposes to increase increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special guichet for new loaders is opened to public since 18 November.
"It works for a week, so it's still at the test," answers, after a moment of exhibition, the employee behind the kitchen when the client is present as journalist.
Deregulation and old apartments of Bakal's miners are a very sensitive subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and origin of the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralec region of the democratic society has made a lot of support before the elections and then fills the local journals.
"20 years after them, I want a new planch."
"They didn't even change a piece of balls in the wc, the man mentioned in introduction.
However, in particular, according to the employees, retreats that come to be sure they will receive a retreat on the new price of the loyalty if they are now signed as the RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a restriction of the half of the rate of the loader that will receive other locators that have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregularation" guichet of the Havirovaska street is not really attracted by the issues.
"For 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40-50 were coming to get it," said the employer.
And however, RPG provides so much on its website and in the vitrines of individual treatment on the ships when it is necessary.
If the two parties don't listen to the law is an independent court that will take the decision.
"It's not a threat but only to report on the unique and legitimate way to act legally," says RPG on his website.
"Nobody goes to the court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Bty and the man in the street before the client center makes him right.
"I have 13000 corners of retreat and I have 5000 corners to eat, I don't have enough to go to the court," he said.
The employee felt so bad at the air.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralec in the media requests nobody sign and so people wait," she says.
The regulation of leaders is finished in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Bty, are an economic need.
"And in addition, the current loaders do not always have the need for the simple maintenance of the funds for residences," Remembers Pavel Klimes, the resident portfolio director of the RPG Bty company, which is just the negligency of the funds for the location in cold is the principal reason for the increase of the loyalty.
However, in five years between 2005 and 2010, the RPG had been able to invest in 4 billion apartments, in the four years of 2011 to 2014, it would have been 5.2 billion.
The large screen increasing on the front of the rebounded failures from the Havirosvka street, however, repeat some information indicated in red.
"The increase of the shipment in 2011 is 15% and does not matter less than 31200 apartments or more than 90% of the RPG apartments."
"And this will always be at the top 7.50 Chinese corners the m2 per month," indicates the screen.
The increase of 38% is only 400 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is a increase of a very lower sum of 19.66 cheques corners to m2," adds RPG.
The next year the loyalty will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Bty promises that degradation will not provoke a radial but progressive increase for 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of the increase of the leaders (cf. the graph) is made to apartments under the shape of chauffage economys - new windows and chauffage.
Those who sign the Agreement on the increase of loyalty have the priority.
The maternal school is part of her, she also included architectes.
the Administrative Building Avriopoint of Brno is the new seat of Arch. Design.
Nobody could expect that he also opens a mini mother school with all the needs - color walls, imaginative mubles, games and finally a range of mini games on the terrace.
Since October of the last year, the children of Arch. design employees can be made there.
Arch architectonic project company. Design. whose ateliers produced a lot of constructions in Brno, imagined its mini-matrix school of business from the first tops of the Avrio Point Building.
She works at about 90 persons, especially the age to make children, and it was important that the architective women and project leaders could quickly return to the work.
At the same time, the maternal school is a good proposal for his employees by Arch. Design. in the framework of its social programme.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to get a job to take care for children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.selves who have imagined this maternal school and with the support of the direction they could have received a point of the European Union and the Ministry of Working and Social Affairs.
The maternal school is financed by means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the statistical budget of the Czech Republic.
With regard to the financing donations (to the height of 2.8 miles of Checs corners), they could buy equipment and equipment and two years later ensure a qualified personnel and the driver.
After using the financing donation (two years), Arch. Design. has the obligation after three years to work the mini school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project has been a year and it is the Economy Rating company that has helped to do the request of approval.
Children are sure of a qualified person, all day a sister and a mother-institutor is occupied by children. Children can go to maternal school without a age limit, but they have more than three of the most.
As it is a "made school mini" can only have five children present at the same time, but in the day there are more who are replaced.
The functioning of school is highlighted according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking on the hierarchical position.
Although it is a single and individual education, the mini mini is comparable to that for the pre-scolar education.
Children do not just play but a quality teaching is also sure - from the beginning until the preparation for school banks are teaching English.
The class is equipped not only of games and imaginative games but also of a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Family parents can control their child and not have the stress of a late time to go looking for children in a distance school from the parent's workplace.
Parents therefore use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not amazing that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employer and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus inscribed among societys who offer a good choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this programme to strengthen the marketing of the RH.
The house in the bones is fascine yet after 100 years. Put an eye in Gaudi's interiors.
The toit seems like a prehistoric saurien, scanner to a vertebral dinosure column and balcons with open fish eye.
That's the house of Casa Batlo in Barcelona of the Antoni Gaudi Architect.
Because of its organic forms, the house received the name of House in os from the locals.
Orginal shapes, savages colors, innormal use of stones, carreaux and mosaic fragments, makes a reminder of scales and parts of the curves, this is all that is ipicical for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal fashion of the house rolls its dream lines, its colors and happy textures that remind the nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, we see the geometry, the ritme and the order considered with precise.
In the night, the house's fashion is still more dramatic and is raised in such a way that the impression of brilliantness of colors is strengthened.
The rolling and torture of forms also appears in the interior with the same measure.
The tree copies the window frames, bathrooms, the decorative elements of the doors, the oilton and the lambs.
The house of Battlo, who is driving in the Example apartment in the Passeig of Gracia at the number. 43 is born from the building of a house of the Emilio Sala Cortes, 1877.
Rebuilding was made for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investors, Joseph Battlo, a rich company, first insisted on the demoliation of old building and the construction of any other new but rapidly accepted Gaudi's idea of an income and better market rebuilding.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house in multiple apartments was not thought by Gaudi only.
Architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that the decorations are born for a representative apartment of the building's owner and the use of the mosaic for the facial.
For the face also worked by other artists and creators.
The common work for the plans of Casa Battlo started by a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of Gaudi Casa Mila house and the Guell park in which there are other works in Gaudi.
The locals have named the hot house just after his end because of its organic forms "The House in Os".
Others, I had a specific mechanism of opening windows called him "the house that goes down."
It is said that in the top of the building there is a sword similar to Sant Georges, the captain of the Catalogne.
Other sculpture elements of the building contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central chauffage time, with aeroplane events and typical routes.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems weird.
During the creation of Gaudi, it was not absolutely respected by others' construction directives and was not allowed to enter them.
At the beginning of the construction he received the permission to build from the city, of course, that the data on rebuilding plans were so vaguely that two years after the end of the municipal counsel was horrified and requested amendments.
For example, the municipal counsel members would not likely that the pioneers of the construction empered on the public throne.
There was never a change, but only 15 days after the call of Josep Battlo was asked (and received satisfaction) the authorisation to praise the two highest stages.
The owner will lead to low stages.
In the gallery at the second stage there was a common room and a third room and a private part of the apartment.
The de-closed rhythm was bound in a bicycle.
The entire house of six stages is shared by a scale by which we are accessed to an independent steel.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replaced by core walls.
Gaudi also works the modern concept of relationship between spaces.
The common part may be fully linked by opening the gates of the rooms and high society can communicate consistently or even limited private space for more intimate treatments.
The house with Gaudi's rebuilding received further new faces a non-traditional toit and two steps in more.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white skins with which the internal court is decorated and with light pools.
The game with two colors gives a maximum light in all the house stages.
It was just enough to think about the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that contrary absorves the sun rays.
The house Casa Batlo, which was written in 2005 in the World Patrimoine Fund of the UNESCO, may be visited by each one.
At the first stage of the house is the most spaceful apartment and the most beautiful accessible to the public.
The owners decided to prevent this step in 2002 at the time of the 150th anniversary of the celebrator's birthday.
They continued the visits because they constated that it is a lucrative company and expanded the field of visits to common spaces and to the border, including toast terraces.
The entertainment belt in the monument is not really nice and cost 16.50 euros; students, training, groups and tourist cards have 20 percent of rabbits.
The sum is even above the input price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to hear the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a company among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a material and dream: women have other criteria than men.
No custom frame, but instead the quality of the surface reserved to bed, so the material and the room gives a real basis for a good bed.
They must certainly be harmonised to enjoy a specific user.
During the choice of several things, it is determined: poids, size, age, health status, and the sex of the owner.
The type of inside in which we will place the material and the room is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the campaign house where we don't always sleep the latex materials are not appropried because they're "rechauffing" hardly.
They have, of surrounding, more than a polyurethan material.
It is necessary often to return them.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart, and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they reach humidity.
The usual is also determined in the choice.
He who passes the light of the time to the stranger where it often uses very space materials with a rammalistic layer, would feel hardly well on a low and hard surface.
"It's so that all hokeyists who return from NHL are pleasant that they can't sleep there."
"For their fatigue skins, feet and coats, they needed materials with a rhythmic skin."
"The same materials are also recommended for persons who suffer diabetes who have a difficulty of the nervous system that therefore the "information" of the articulations and the pearl," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in the removaled mubles.
That's why a few years ago the mathematics with the parseous museum conquired hokeyists and other clients.
"Today it's all right today, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex, but the Tropico Cheque also have appropriate materials.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to appreciate a marvelous museum.
This "miracle" works just.
She optimizes its rigidity and its shape according to the absorbed hair or well adapts to your body's hair.
Nothing presses on you and you won't return in the night as after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
The parseous museum also works as a protection against the square.
For the selection of materials according to your size, add the length of feet, or about 21/34 cm.
So a man and a woman of a size of 180cm needs a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each one bed to two places should be 90 cm or in every 180 cm.
For beds at one place, for example, the single, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of visit.
"But it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the dose, you should put your hands in a comfortable way with the lightly passing cows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-mathalasis and decorators who are concerted for several years in the problem of a healthy dream and the energy of the mobile and teaching it in the special schools.
For a bed at two places, each one needs his own room and matches, so, however, at the time of the achievement of good choosing the height of the material.
If it's not gonna leave you only to mount the shadow to different heights and it's not realisable on all bed frames.
The museum materials should have a minimum height of 14 cm, at least 15 cm materials, of that it counts for the form and aircraft layer at least 3 cm.
"In touching or in position sitting on the materials you don't have to hear the resources," predicted Helena Prokopova.
Each mathematics requests a well-defined type of dream.
The bedroom, when materials and dreams are united as a friendly sisters, there is nothing to do in the rooms to sleep.
The materials were very bad; we don't have to lake it, what's soon happening today.
And since during the night we normally transpipe from 0.2 to 0.75 l summer is clear that after 5/7 years, the material begins to remember a big (and smoking) too.
That is why specialists refused to make an exclamation on a 25-year life period for a material or a living guarantee.
But it's all at his mate.
And for this, an experience advice of the part of the soldiers: for a 120/140cm material, renounce, for the closing of materials, hygiene or lavage, but add more a protection material that you can easily remove and lavage.
And even though from our days it is frequency to manufacture clothes with slider clothes for all the whole, it is to say that after the opening, we have two parts (for the lavage and the size of the machine to lavage, it is very important!) except the manipulation for large models (and for a single person), when we get them a fight between a lower piece and a lower paint on a ring.
Do you have a ridiculous board in your bed instead of a dream?
Never!
Maximum for a bed destined to visitors for one night.
However, equippe the board (if there is no) of aircrafts and use the rear materials with a minimum height of 15cm with sachets resources (in Germany Taschenfederken) and a aircraft.
A polyurethan material should not be part of this guy's bed.
For single rooms with 14/18 lameles, latex materials or sandwichs (possibly the combination of latex and coco noise) are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a material with more lameles, 28 and above, where the lamps are doubled in the bottom of the rain and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For materials at several positions, it does not need to take materials to resort because it does not respond to the changes of position.
Besides the rigidity of the lambs, we can also install what is called a boxer.
It is a special connection of lameles that allows you to press the lame increasing the lame so that the "intelligence" bedroom is well.
For men who have "the balls as large as the dose," it's really important thing.
This is already considered by material manufacturers who have started to use a ramolyzing area at the level of the area.
But they also think of women - they offer a more lower surface at the level of hunchs.
For the most difficult customer, there are rooms of alas or plaquetes with which it is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure is decreased in more points and decreases tension.
But, of course, attention, when you use a bad ears (grand and ringed air) on good materials and dreams, the "plaus" lost.
The basic rule is a simple ears: the ear must support the head and its points must only be achieved, so that the muscles of the ball can be relaxed.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavs prevent for example.
When it is extended on the side, the ear should upgrade (with the shadow of the shadow or the rubber area in the matrices) the height of the edges.
The modern materials are still common with the first-based ball and herbs.
The manufacturers still use natural materials or melanges.
The tendance is also at bio materials.
The first materials based on petrol, from which the polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils, such as soja oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soja.
"The Bio quality for materials means that the heart is manufactured based on natural products," explains Peter vasicek of the Tropico Plus society.
Natural materials are also used for material clothes; one of the first was the real place.
But you can add micro capsules that develop forests or lavands.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extent of ball plants to absorbed material clothes and refroid the body, "refreidit" the man, the "chauffing" clothes the women.
The extent of red power increases blood circulation and so it's more heavy for the low sex.
Current preferences?
The materials manufactured from fridge museum (he has more porches with a cellular structure thus more respiratory than the standard polyurethane and has more elastic.
The combination of various rigids of fresh muscles gives polyzone materials that exactly know where the head is found, the bottom of the dose and the feet.
You will pay a quality material from 7000 corners and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters are less than TVA and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex is the first place.
Economising for materials and the room is not easy.
It may have time to have special actions in the framework of manufacturers or producers two materials for a single price.
For example, the Magniflex society that proposes Duof Reese materials with the mushroom of Memory cooked in clothing for 11990 coronys.
Of course, we can take the second free.
The time of parseous or viscoelastic muscles with a open cell structure and a large space was started with the temperature material at a "cosmic ritme".
This started as a material for the NASA because the astronauts were in the start of large charge factors.
The Temple rose to the chair and suffered, in contrast, the frog.
He is therefore perfectly adapted to the hot human body and distributed to him a optimal pressure.
It's for this ideal against the bad sleep and for a increase of comfort during the dream.
Vicoelastic muscles are used not only for materials but also for products for health, such as special cousins for feet covering the feet and the weapon system.
Chec manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver or the same type.
The devices to follow people are more demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child brings more people to think about them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning for searching cars, can also be used to track people's movement and help for some cases such as the small Anicka Janakava.
The instrument is currently too big as a box of allumettes but will be immediately from the size of a monster.
The case of the small Anicka has emotionated a lot of people and they have started looking for the way to protect their children better.
Even if the price is to trouble their private life.
"We are trying to say to everyone that it is not a spionage but only another way to decrease the probability that there is another tragedy," says Peter Pilin of the Macro Weil society, which is one of the providers of training devices on the Czech market.
"I believe that there may be bad jobs of such devices, such as put it in the box of a person who is not in the current, but I haven't yet met such cases."
"The most people are clients who actually buy the product for safety reasons, adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what purposes it is used "the box" and how to use it in urgent case.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, take care of that if the child doesn't want to bring on him something of that type, he'll disappear it.
"And even the smallest can show a great creativity when it's going to get out of something when they don't want to be under control."
"The portable phones, which can be cut off like these track devices, have already brought parents to long attempts," said Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the case of agression is very discussible.
"If it's a rap prepared, the author will do everything so that the child has no electronic device that can locate it."
"Today, it's the phone."
"When they will develop training equipment, they (criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by a public campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be on the police," said the psychologist.
She shows even as such devices can help when a phadofile is not prepared.
According to Robert Chech of the RC Monitoring company, which proposes training services for cars and cars for people, shows that there is a type of device that can help, even if it has been destroyed in the case of an aggression.
"The device may be set up so that it is in regular emission after a period specified."
"In the case where the camera is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The most favorable devices have also a inclinemeter that signs immediately the position of the person who has broken and has been located in a long position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, the smart phones that are equipped from a navigation system can provide a comparable service after formatting it with a special protocol.
The problem of the current trace systems is that it is a similar device to those who are carried out in pendensive size of an alumet box or to smaller phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil society, tests are currently carried out to make equipment similar to common digital shows.
"This will be the advance that the eventually attacker can't recognize the trace device."
"Of it will take account after a certain time, what would have given the police a little more time," adds he.
If the trace device is developed under the form of bracelet or pendent, it would always use the same technology as to track cars.
It is a combination of a GPS-accommodation system (which is shortly used in autonavigation) and a function of a portable phone that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has a lot of detonant corners that she could make the tour of the Czech Republic with, but she can only have two years.
The army buyed for 445 km of branches used for explosives.
Dej√† last year, the Ministry of Defence was buying it 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the branches is two to four years.
The army buyed branches to the anonymous STV Group for 40 million coroners.
The most general state has given a reason for the achievement of a large quantity of branches in MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the pyrotechnics of the Army, that MF DNES has contacted, it is considered that even generals, the officers with a command, secretary or well employees should have an exercise for explosives each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, the Army Commander does not make exclusion.
Only to argument the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonant branches.
This distance corresponds to 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could have been there for 10 years.
If, in contrast, it would be true that for the basis of each new professional training is sufficient to over 2 m detonant corners, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new accaat has assured - also the consumption of special units and genes - reserves for 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention forces recently discovered the Ministry Vondra that they have almost no munitions for their poing weapons and that fire sessions are limited because of money needs.
I'm not talking about the missing body lens.
"And I don't take my head if they buy a lot of detonant corners in our house."
"It's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for our army is a good client that we are efforts as commercials of joy," said the STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, port-word of the Ministry of Defence, arguments the achievement of hundreds of miles of branches that the army will have these "munitions" for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, only four years of life of detonators and pirotechnics of the police and the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly attached to the deposits, it can even go to four years," said one who doesn't want his name to be published on the crisis of the Army.
The last life period, each munition must be tested to see whether it remains entire and does not worry the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and cost money.
The second argument of the Ministry is a rabbit due to the quantity of 445 km detonant branches.
"They have costed us 60 percent less than the offering of the year past of 245 km," indicates Pejsek's port, which is the interprete of the opinion of the officers of the Defence Ministry.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of pirotechnic branches of the police who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or well after the Soviet Army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always commands the needed quantity of munitions to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the reasons for the safety of pyrotechnics and to achieve more than modern and more faithful types of branches.
the Ministry of Defence has today great problems for the neutralisation of ten tonnes of municipality from the time of Warsovie Package when the strong Checoslovaca army was prepared to move, not on the Rhin.
What is waiting for a few years this cheque army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of old corners that she gets "a good market" today.
Before this day, I'm getting use of contacts I have received thanks to competitors.
The sale of his hotel was well helped Lukas Pytloun for the location of the concours of the best individual enterprise.
The guaranteer of the best individual enterprise for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a companioner of 28 years.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Luke Pytloun, you like a travel.
And in the foreign, he realized that in Liberec he missed a location of quality hotel for a reasonable price.
From his economy on what he had won when he worked in the foreign and with the help of a banking price he buyed a small building of 5 apartments at half democracy.
While he knew that he was still studying in the third year of higher studies, it was a courageous action.
"The report between the quality and the price of a hotel in our region gave me to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to loud the first apartment rebuilt to strangers.
He reinvested the benefit in the building that he converted in pension with 54 beds.
Since this time, his companier's action allowed him to open at Liberec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 lits of all hotel categories.
The most comfortable among them was until the four stars of Pytloun design hotel.
This year he came to him another identical quality.
"We're just going to sign a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our French concept and other candidates to the France Hotels of Pytloun's hotels," number 1 of the employees in the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the implementation of a large-scale hotel, the victory at the concurrency of the year's companies has well served, added Pytloun with reconnaissance.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Liberac and its environments.
"The people recognized me in the streets, greeted me often, and, I should say, it was very pleasant," he remembered.
He recommends participation in this concourse to all those who try to do something.
This is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge until today that he couldn't get another way.
"Besides those I met through the concourse I began to maintain commercial relations regularly.
According to him, the rename to success has also affected employees.
And he's about 70.
"I observe the loyalty and the honour of being involved in something that was generally recognized."
"This is not the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"It's only my name's pitched before," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my follower a better year than that we had in Farmet.
The evacuation of the victory was immediately replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective of the winter Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
He who came to look for the price in Slovansky dum for the first place of concourse for the year organized by Vodaphone last year was Karel Zdarsky the owner of Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a builder in Ceska Escalaice in a firm number of businesses of 100 million coroners.
"I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me, too, my cooperators and has increased our confidence in itself to fight competition," says the guaranteer of the concurrency last year.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet company, there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed Karel Zdrasky's father to praise the small airport as compensation after the confishing of goods by communists, he was not long-term, he refused a carrier in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some companies in the area of his father for the manufacture of plastic bathrooms.
Not too long after they started specializing themselves in vegetable oil pressures.
It became the biggest automatic press producer in Central Europe after eight years.
The company was known even in the non-specialised public after the success of the competition through media.
"No only our clients have started to know Farmet's mark, but also the stranger partners who have started to know that they have cooperated with a company who has obtained the greatest success in his origin country," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the expired year wasn't past in Farmet only leaving the euphoria of the victory.
The assessment of the company was made by economic results in 2008 and in part of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which was not really touched by citizens, the company had been obligated to stop their investment projects and to restrict their new materials and technologies.
"We didn't obviously escape this situation."
"The business numbers are caught 40%, and we should be limited to our production and the same licence," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that it is necessary to take immunity measures for time.
But they supported the situation correctly and maintained beneficial results even if they were less than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre, we have strengthened the presentation of the society in international exhibitions and win the major rewards in the national expositions," says Zdarsky.
Let us all think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of employees are rebound and the number of employees are also with them.
"A new winter I want this pleasant feeling of the victory but in a quiet atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes insensed regulations.
The investigation on the annual Absurdity is for the fourth time part of the Affairs Clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The little glorious persecutor of this year of investigation on the annual Absurdity was the obligation to bring in document offices that the officials can get online.
More than the third of the 4000 voters have voted for this.
For example, the administration of social businesses requested a paper extract from the trade record while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
that changes through the research.
"The Chec Administration of Social Affairs will no longer request the outcome of the trade record for the payment controls of the assessment controls," indicated Jana Buranov, the port-word of the Chec Administer of Social Security (CSSZ).
Recognise all regulations and decisions that companies and businessmen should fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this concourse of the year's Absurdity.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business club organized by Hospodarske newviny and has a larger population.
If the last year 3000 votants have been manifested, it is at least 4000 this year who have voted their voice.
And it is not amazing, there are the most legitimate obligations in our country that do not just break the business, and, more, more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be fulfilled for the first statements in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium businesses and companies of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of the employer's activities becomes an objective proclaimed by all governments in the past years.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve everything.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is located at the 74th place for the conditions for the company, or more than 8 places in relation to the last year.
The concourse of the year Absurdity was established for the first time in 2006 and continued each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can be able to stay each year of administrative and bureaucratic absurdities at the end of September, last time before the concourse is closed.
To take account of the website www.firroku.cz. Then, the concours organizator chooses seven candidates for "the antiprix" and let the public vote in October on the website www.firmanroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihnd.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of voices is declared to wingers.
Before the last investigation of the last year, it is a hundred or more than 105 rules and decisions that have lost their sense of existence.
The notes are sent by companies but also professional units and teachers.
Thus, among the "finalists" of the concours, among the names is the obligation that the cars of manufacturer and quick ways patterns, or even the businessers with twenty employees, repair two offices and two tuckets each year.
the list of seven proposals is published on the concourse site.
The proclaiming of the concours, which always begins at the beginning of November on the Venezuela Place in Prague, is a part of the event in which they are regularly participating in political and public personality.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for the small and average companies of the Czech Republic or Peter Kuzel, President of the Czech Republic trade room, assisted at the moment of concourse.
"Economic property cannot be functioned when the State put acts in the feet of the undertakers and therefore my objective is to remove each year at least three decades of paragraphs that do not only comply with the business today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industrial and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd decisions is not a sword sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasant to people was the obligation of companies to declare three days before the office for the individual business at the place where the company is found, the intention to go to an exposition or a penalty with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the Agreement of the Act on the individual business.
The second plebised obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Working Office a service journey for a foreign employer for 30 days, was deleted with the text of the Act on the name of the Green Card.
And everything's okay until the third session of the concourse.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decision for physiotherapeutes to have a great view in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by the order of the Ministry of Health in the last year, the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
The ecological, humanitarian, training or yet sportive projects are evaluated.
The news of this year of Hospodarske Noviny concours, which already exists since five years, is the category called the Responsable Firma of 2010.
The objective of this concourse is the support of the reasonable and just business.
"We want to support society who monitor their environmental impacts and make a socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Portable phone operator, the firm Vodaphone, who is the guarantee and promotor of this competition, such as in the case of the concourse for the rebellion of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the concurrency of the firm of 2010, organized by Vodaphone firm, companys who have not succeeded with the only long-term objective for the company.
The event of each of them is rich inspirations and an independent article would be edited.
Although their business is different from one of the other, their support and prevention activities may be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, it is concerned with disabilities and personal problems or health of their employees.
In the fourth finalists for the Czech Republic, there is no example the company of practical protocols and Netera that support the creation of informal sport teams of their employees that then participate in a number of tours in various sport disciples.
Another example of firm responsibility in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo society, which is from 17 years the main contributor to the dotation fund that sponsors the children's happy.
In the case of employees with health problems, the old use of manufacturer of Podbrad is still employed more than 70 per cent and, for this, has received the title of the firm responsible for the Central Boheme region and has been placed third in the region in the concurrence of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial society, which has gathered to introduce customs work hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week and, without proportionally, payment reduction.
The jury also declared the title because it is a priority to the Checs manufacturers, supporting a weak activities in the near environment and care for the environment.
"We are trying to recycling the most possible thing that our business activities and administration have the least effect on the environment," explains Miluse Ryzarova, the Executive Director of the society.
The IT responsible society In location of Usti's Regions also thinks of the health of its employees and put them in place for each portable computer a chase and an ethnic keyboard, encourage their home work and use the services to category of a local protection use for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roman community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the society.
In the last range, there is also a lavage company and cleaning the region of Karlovy Vary, who participates in the retrained security of its employees under the form of goods above the standards.
"In our society, we contribute to food, transport, increased qualities and lawers," said Joseph Strapac of the Czash Bruntal Building Society, a guaranteer for the region of Moravie-Silesia.
They were automatically insert in the responsible society category, all regional finalists for the concurrence of the Vodaphone year, which had responded to the questionnaires in annex of the document for the inscription and sent it to the organizator before 15 August.
The wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the concours by the organizator.
"If the representatives of foreign firms had not responded to the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the responsible firm but would not be disqualified from the "principal" concurrence of Vodaphone's year."
"Independent inscriptions are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main concourse of the year's company," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose Organizer.
In the Fund for the Terres in Plzen, the police had been arrested during a public concours
In the Building of the Fund for the Terres in Plzen, the anti-corruption police processed arrests these last days.
Detectives have passed the mistakes to the local employee and traded in immobiliating Lubos. G.
This was endeavored to manipulate just a call of public offers for the regulation of a refund request so that the country proposed would be obtained by a candidate determined.
This should be paid to Lubos G. a half million corners.
"For this time, I can only confirm that the police continues a person for initiative in the framework of an offer call and a public concourse," said the director of Plzen Antonia Zelena, who knows that it is prohibited to provide more explanations because the investigation is current.
After 24 hours, the police remitted this 46-year employer in freedom.
In order to know how he could influence a public concourse, we can only specify a little of the official information.
In a question of Pravo, the Port-World of the Terrains Funds Lubomira Cerna stated that the police had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and, during the public competition.
"It's a client, and in no case of a employee, she has stated.
The public concours according to Cerna has a real name "Call to propose rights for the transmission of lands according to the Law on the earth" and is placed when several legal candidates are demonstrated.
"There are proposed, in the framework of the call, a higher value of their rights to resorts that should be regulated before the value of the land is announced."
"Because the rights proposed a classification of the accusers is placed and the Planet Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's door-word.
Lubos G. had clearly, the information about people who were inscripted to the call and as he himself was, also a person to benefit because he had buyed a lot of refund rights, he proposed the candidates in the country to not participate in the competition.
And he's sure he's getting out of the fact that he was departing.
What would explain why he had a lot of money in his possession during his interpretation.
Lubos G. had largely contacts above standards at FDT (Fonds of Earth).
It was in the case of the ex-header of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, which was continued to the penalty to edit lands for which the decision was already edited in place of a construction.
Justice Lubos G., for example, had obtained lands destined to build public communications, particularly in place and place where the art of access to Borske Pole industry.
Afterward, he switched it with the Maria for a building in the historical center of the city whose value is very far above.
Maria was obligated to accept because if it was risked to put the construction in peril by a block of lands.
The minages will pay an addition of a hundred corners monthly for the residence.
Since January, the mines should be paid a addition not only for all types of energy but also for water and exploitation, chauffing facilities, and to some locations, the leaders will also increase.
Thus, from January, the family will have to shoot from their port-monee to a hundred monthly more coroner than now.
The electricity increases 4.6 per cent, the gas of almost 2 per cent more precious, in some locations you should pay to a decade of more water offers and in many places the central gas offers will also be more worthy.
The increase of the electricity should be prevented for the mixtures in the apartment of the 100 corners annually more than currently.
However, all providers have reduced the prices of electricity by the sensitive development to encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovolt pillars.
The gas increased moderately but sure at the time people need the most needed to be challenged and so they have the biggest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred corners in more.
Although electricity and gas increases in the whole Czech Republic, the change of the price of the central challenge is different from cities in town.
These are mainly the largest commons planning the increase of prices.
For example, the Mines in Pardubic or Hradec Krooce are intended to count January for the central chauffage of almost 50 corners of more than a month, the Liberec families have more than 1000 corners each year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, a increase of 9 per cent for water is prepared and the assumption for the case where the city increases infrastructure loaders.
If the shipers don't change the plagues pay an extension of 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lower parts in comparison with the whole country.
In the north Boh√™me, where prices are already part of the highest, water and assault increases 7.4 per cent.
The prices of the loyalty will, for example, increase sensitively in 450 thousand apartments from January, is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Bity company who has almost 2500 apartments in Usti over Labem decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who are not agreed with the new increase of leaders will be translated before the courts by the company.
Regular ships that patterns of people in about 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year of 10 percent.
The Cheques children smooth at the rum and the fernet. The beer is not more modest and do so hard.
The fernet, the rhum, the Vodka and the best whisky mark are also volated to parents.
These are drinks that bring most often those who sauce themselves, who have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are in the hospital for receiving do not make exclusion.
This results of the experience of doctors who met in cases similar to the admissions of children of hospitals.
"The beers or wines are no longer mode because we need time to be saoul."
"The tendance is really for strong alcohols," indicates for Pravo Ludek Pelika, Chief of the Children of the Hospital in Central Boh√™me.
"When they succeeded to catch a bottle to Daddy in the armor, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fernet and the Vodka who prefers."
"The Vodka has this benefit that they can meet it with fruit juice and do not hear it," explains the Department's captain.
Eva Jurinov, port-wort of the hospital Motel, also makes it right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it's a slave that they have returned from the house," added Jurino.
According to P√©lian Department Leader, you see children of trety to fourteen years old to hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since the last year, he was in Motel, where he was ten years just in pediatrie where the ambulances brought full-free schools in the areas.
"A young girl was hospitalized so four times
"He began her carrier to twelve years when she was carried up with 3.5 for thousands of alcohol in blood with more than one measure with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"They was at the Holesovice Exposition Park at a party."
"What is interesting is that it was not stranger to mother that her daughter was absent 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the deinteressance of parents or their tolerance out of the common face that their rejections are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about the dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Besides the alcohol vocabulary, a chronic dependence on the alcohol of several years with all the phenomenones that disappear, but that it is not found in children."
"To those who use the acool to repeat, it is more than a social-familial background significantly disfavorable," explained the Chef of Pelikan Department.
According to Jurinov‚Äôs door-word, about 40 children of drink have been hospitalized this year until the mid- November in the Mediterranean clinical clinical in Motel.
It is not integrated in statistics only cases with an incision rate required for hospitalization.
The children of drink that are after the urgencies returned to them by parents or by police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking an alcohol bottle after school, he exceeds three saisonary eggs with which you can count: the day of sorcery, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink a little while after bad results, or in contrast, they feed the beginning of vacances."
"I'm sure I lived on the day of the sorcerers a admission of 7 children of drink of one way," says Peelika.
The kid drinking who passed the night in the hospital in deintoxion under medical control is paradoxaally in a better position than he who came home and suffers the next day of the "good of tree".
The glucose infusion of glucose and nutritive elements which the organism needs are deleted by the morning's heads.
"They're better for that because they're going to pass a great night after a painful wave and nothing dos evil to them."
"They are just surprised from the place where they are," added Pelikan, who knows that this is a good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalisation on intensive care beds can go to tens of thousands of coroners.
"On time, I applied this as a education method in counting these children how much their eggs costed and that they could pass over the whole saisonary work for a single evening," added Pelikan.
However, according to him, health security companys in their regressive management, which should be reached from the parents the charges related to care, do not treat the cases of drinking children.
Two L-159 aircrafts are first in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 aircrafts of the five in all which the Ministry of Defence has changed transport aircraft Casa C-295M, have decolled March for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft produced.
It's the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone else than the Czech Army.
However, they were foreign in the framework of exercise or demonstration vols.
It was two versions of L-159T1 that were still in service in the Czech Army and which were in the state of air.
The resting devices are monoplaces of L-159.
These are currently stated at Air Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took them in account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence Press Office, the physical department of Vodochody aircraft is now unknown.
"The L-159 Monoplaces for the switch have been taken on aeroplanes stored for a long time without that it causes additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The Bishops L-159 T1 have been changed in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He declared that the army would not stay without bipla because the Ministry signed in May 2009 with Air Vodochody an agreement with a value of 200 million corones for the transformation of four monoplaces L-159 unused in two bishops.
The army was delivered from the first equipment in July, the second submitted to the delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, the aircraft was tried to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract, it is clearly indicated that he who takes the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will serve in the training of the OTAN Member States' pilots."
"It's therefore the matter of the one who takes into account to determine how to do this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske newviny announced, a few years ago, that the Spanish Army is not interested by L-159.
The switch of five L-159 for a Casa airport and the achievement of three other aircrafts for 3.5 billion core has been in the last year by the Government of Mireck Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not started an offer call and has directly contacted EADS.
The direction of the defence argumented that the exchange ensures a future export from L-159 to the foreign.
The Chec army buyed at Air Vodoccody 72 devices and uses it only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The achievement of aeroplanes Casa will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission declared clearly against the Chec Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice because the aircraft had to be chosen in the framework of an offer for the European scale and in no case to contact a manufacturer directly.
The army has already been delivered from three aeroplanes of Casa, the last should come on the Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than annulator is a low risk sign of cancer
Mans who have the longer index than the annulator are exposed to a risk to have a cancer of prostate.
This is the surprising conclusion of a medical study published by the British Cancer magazine.
This may depend on the level of the hormone the testosteron.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the simple test test of prostate cancer, in particular for men before 60 years," announced Ros Eeles, teacher of the Institute for the Cancer University of Warwick.
The dog could so help us to determine which men should be submitted to the test of the prostate cancer, in particular in combination with genetic risk or other aggressive factors such as the family health antengents, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients from a cancer of prostate and at the same time about three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right shorter than the annulator.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the dawns of the same length, we found the same probability of a cancer of the prostate.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index as the risk cancellation has fallen to 33%, for men before 60 years the risk reduction has increased 87%.
The report of the length of the two citizens - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, in particular, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the other area.
Less than testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous researchs have shown that it is just the testosterone that helps the development of a prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, the Genetic Renamed Chec and Ancient President of the Scientific Academy, said for CTK that he is currently in this study but that he doesn't seem it, he is, that the relationship between the length of the dogs and the cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 authors are closed.
The Chess like most of Europe is this morning juice covered by the snow.
On the streets and throats, there are most of the compact weather, the debtors have worked all night in many places.
The D5 author is closed on the morning between 89th and 93 kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov because of several car accidents and car cars and D1 at Brno in Prague's direction is the same way.
The device of the Central AutoClub (UAMK) told it to the information
At 91 miles a car has been accidented, at 93th of the 93th two weights were percuted, the accident has done wounds.
Many cars were also found in the shadow.
The issues are also on the D1 to 185 kilometers in Prague's direction.
Two trucks have been lost
The drivers should just go out after Brno to 190 miles or go by Brno and then enter to Kyvalka 182 miles.
A car file of several kilometres was formed in this place.
Like the D11 author, there is an accident and, just at the arrival of Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters of space, the termometres indicate - 7 degrees of Celsius.
For example, car files are created in Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also broken.
The most safe transport means is the metro.
Tramways, for example, retard on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Notsti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours of the morning, Prague's highest crisis must still be gathered together.
The ferrored paths and the airport have also occurred problems.
Chess ferry paths have already had to be removed because of the snow 7 quick connections.

Most of the streets in South Moravie is already roundable but redouble of vigilance.
On the street of Wyskov, three side routes are impressive, on the road of Brno begins to have snow railways and on the white road the chains are obligated to pass some communicating paths in the highest places.
The Wyskov region is part of the most touched locations.
Before now the asss are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send denegatives and snow fresh.
We can't appreciate it right now when they'll be rollable.
On the road of Hodonin, the proudness is rigorous in the white Carpathes region.
On the roads, regarding the protection of nature, contained only by the aspersion of inert products, there is also a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warned CTK.
In Czech, he fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; he fell most in the north Boheme, with, often, to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the region of Moravie-Sil√°sia, he fell to 15 centimeters of snow.
The injection was progressively shooting in Czech.
The Americans have a new "pleasant weapons"
The American army sent a new "intelligent weapons" to Afghanistan, known only under the XM-25 code.
Generals think that this new fuel will have an influence on the conflict with the Talibans and "the game has changed" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-specific canon
His projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special calibrations of 25 mm developed for this fusil and containing a highly broken explosive, actually work as small grenades.
We can programme municipalities such as they will explore in the contact of the target, but also at any point of their balistic trajector.
So we can use it against an enemy that is hidden behind an obstacle, a wall or a foot.
He is not protected from above, and when he falls on a rain of ice rain, it can also put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of XM-25, the new fusil is the first gun of childhood that uses the "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier is essentially as such as he finds the target, sends him a laser ratio that determines the distance, gets a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his visited site and presses the detention.
"What you've seen at 543 meters."
"When you press the detention, the weapons are loaded and shooted at the distance of 543 meters or minus 1,2,3 metres, said Audette.
400 deposited jobs
The Fujitsu Group declines his office from Bad Homburg to Francfort.
The next year in July, 400 collaborators will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located to the office building of the Marenbader Place in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese Fujitsu group locates its sucursal of Bad Homburg in Francfort.
As the specialised gene in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located until now on the location Marienbader of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a large complex office located on the street Lyoner Stra√üe from Queartier Niederrad de Francfort.
A port-word of Fujitsu explained that the group should regroup 100 other employees until here in the region.
The location offer was extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open air offices of Astro Park are better in the work mode of collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just located.
The Director of General, Bernd Wagner, said, "Frankfurt-Nederrad is a primary location that has a remarkable infrastructure."
It indicates that the connection to the airport is just a great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new degradation of an important company in the region has thus reached the joy of the guests and caused the deception of losers.
The responsibility of economic affairs of the municipality of Francfort, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), stated that a "planetary actor" was so conquired.
It's a "external faith professional in place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees to the city and its implantation is an important election for Niderrad.
The Master of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Green), regulates Fujitsu's decision.
The direction has informed the municipality of this intention.
"He will not say that we have proposed our assistance to this business," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer face to the owner of the Marienbader Building.
Finally, economic reasons would be determined.
It is then to escape that a place such as exceptional is not inoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and bathroom of the building will show cooperative."
10 years ago, the building of the Hotel of Ville, used here by Fujitsu society and the "Vertical Peit" nearby, and the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad, were part of the project of construction against the temperature station.
With a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new input of the city was created between the garden and the town Hotel. This makes many critical, not only because of the impressioning of the surfaces that served in parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the notation and advice company in investment, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, have been carried into buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Francfort specialised Immobilien-Chancen reached the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the immobilier fund Morgan Stanley. One year later, these buildings were rewarded to the Spanish Falcon Real State investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group where the seat is located in Tokyo is considered as the third largest provider of computer products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and services to the provision of businesses and ensures the essential service.
His sucursal established in the region of Rhin-Main is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is sure much more employed in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leave Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Nederrad. The other offices present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters took place in the Astro Park building.
This old complex of twenty years, whose name reminds its plan in the form of star, opens between others the seat of the Conference of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industries.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Menaces against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks test more in more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service provider removed the specialised site from his servers in the revelation of confidential documents.
This secret aspect may be political pressures under the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The Wikileaks funder, Mr. Assange, appears likely in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks site is attacked with always more force.
The group of cyber-activity " Wikileaks" has no longer access to his host held here in America and then look for a heberger in Europe.
During this time, the American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called other countries and businesses to boycotter Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched by Interpol, probably sits in British, according to the information published by journals.
"Wikileaks exclude Amazon server."
"Free of expression in the country of freedom," indicated mercredi (local hour) ciber-activists in the origin of revelations through the Twitter social network.
Before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from his servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, ciber-activitys have reviewed the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to achieve the largest number of access to documents.
In Twitter, Wikileaks continued his statements: "Formidable, our dollars are now expensed to take care of people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression has a problem in Amazon, "they should stop sell books."
The CNN television chain, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks to use his servers after the investigation of the co-operators of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The President of the Senat Committee for the Protection of the Territory had amended the Amazon website to organize a boycot to his meeting, reported the British Journal, The Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this measure in respect of the previous publications by Wikileaks of the classified information," said the senator.
Parallelly, Mr. Liebermann called other countries to refuse the use of the servers through the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstruous and without scrupules, and it makes our national security in danger and loss of life throughout the world," says a communicated of the independent senators.
"Any company conscious of its responsibilities, that she is American or stranger, should not help Wikileaks to discharge the content of the documents flowed."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is searched by the Sweden authorities because he is suffered of violence, figures on the list of people searched by Interpol.
According to the information published by the London Journal "The Independent", Australian of 39 years lived in Great Britain and Scotland Yard exactly where he finds it.
The cyber-activist has constantly qualified organized intrigues orchestrated by its detractors the continuous continuous achievement of its meeting by Sweden.
The Whikileaks' portword, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told London that men are pronounced against the site.
"The calls were even launched for the killer of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange, particularly fearing his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That is why the Wikileaks funder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson reacted manifestly to the statements made in North America.
In America, the ancient Republican Governor of the Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the responsible for the statements made by Wikileaks should be continued and executed for transmission.
In Canada, the counseler of the Governing Board of Mr. Stephan Harper said to the TV, in an ironic way, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
During this time, a polemic declined between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the president of the American President, Mr. Barack Obama, was "rediculous and absurde" the fact that Mr. Ashange had required the demission of the Secretary-General of Hilary Clinton, if this was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and developed all recently, to deliver themselves to spionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of a owner of a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than the awareness of a web site."
The United States Government is then completely fully in the test bank the protection of its databases.
According to a communicated from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, adjoint director of the Anti-Terroristic Boat Centre, was called responsible for fighting the fugitives.
Mr. Travers is carried out to put "the necessary structure reforms" indispensable results after the diplomation of Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will of checking the means by which all administration changes and protects information.
Furthermore, the American government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of disasters and military men if these were never wounded by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything to enter in contact with them," indicated the door of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Glace
In the "Gelato University" of Bol√≥n, we are prepared for ice trusters to the best income in the year.
The initiation course of three days organized in the interest of the future glass had a great succeed and attacked visitors from all the world.
In fact, where's all the glass coming?
Glacier and glass machine.
The glass, in Germany, is a little demoed glass truster, makes the cryme in accordance with all the rules of the Italian ice manufacture of glass.
The glass turbine removes the ice cryme of the fresh vitrine with a spatule, the room in the gaufra and then starts to sell it.
To know that, we don't need to go to Anzola of Emilia to the Province of Bol√≥n.
But whoever wants to know more about the glass can't abuse "Glato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani firm.
The manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams of glass sorties of its machines are responsible for high Italian ideas.
The starting course of three days organized in the interest of the future glaceers had a great succeed and attacked visitors from all the world.
They are also offered special courses that are carried out on the ice of chocolate and are expanded for several days, and practical meetings are also organized in the private glacery.
In full crisis of the 40th, a number of people dream from a new carrier, others simply risk their desires burning on the light glass.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia throughout Hungary.
Jacky, an artistical education teacher comes from California is held by the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product in the country of the industrial glace.
Anke de Berlin is advised in business management and, after a few years, she wants to shoot some of this testing method for nerves.
Two young Egyptians sleep to open a glass in Caire.
An originary man from Malte and another coming from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the glass clima in their bars, and the Canadian Menage woman came because his children worship Italian glass crowds.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari explains first the ideal characteristics of perfect ices.
It is determined not only the good salvation, but also the supply and the good conscience.
However, Luciano does not forget the circus on the ship of the national superstructure and, in general, south: "The Italian glass is just the best: and then she keeps a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in the manufacturing appears very simple.
Luciano sees basic ingr√©dients, such as the lake, the claim, the lake pound, the sugar and the stabilizers in a large measurer that carries up to 85 degrees by an electronic program, then refroved immediately to four degrees.
He then opens a rocket installed on the machine: it produces a white basic cryme, based on all kinds of glass on the lake.
The formater is immediately ashamed of question: Is it possible to produce ice using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of experience?
Mr. Luciano is guarding against the fact that the time's spirit is wrong.
The one who speaks only "fabricated from natural ingr√©dients" may not be used by stabilisators: most often a natural product, for example, of the farine of guarantee grain obtained from the guarantee haricot.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without use of stabilisator, only to sell it in a period of 24 hours, if it is grounded and the client will not cross anything else than glass granules.
Some changes of the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more comfortable with the arhomas.
Master Luciano sets the difference between ingr√©dients that are achieved in the fruits or confidences of the supermarket.
Furthermore, there are pudding and puddings.
"The providers will all try to refil you twelve aromatic incredients."
"Anyway, you should just try."
It is in the recipes of soil for fruits with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in the glass crowds produced from the white basic mass which, in addition to birds, becomes a yellow cryme, when it is added from the cacao puzzle, the base of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must pass to the use of glass machines.
Luciano invites them for time to manufacture four kinds of glass: for vanille, chocolate, moka and noise with or without oxygen in the base mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingr√©dients.
The various types of glass for fruit are also submitted to the same experience.
More than aromatic substances, more pure fruits: from the view of the good point, it is not absolutely better.
The glass to the noise does not comply with the goodness of the noise when it is composed in a large part of noise.
The ice to kiwi, very popular, is produced from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less than stabilisator.
"Only a equilibrate measure raises correctly the goat of a glass," said Luciano.
The production of glass is a calculation exercise: if it is used of fishing cleaning with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar must be reduced in the base recette.
A sugar supply is required for the ice to the citron.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar of different types of fruit (the winds are serving to measure the Oechsle grade in the race moon).
Happy, tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of glass is no longer required, such as early, as physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic manufacture machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice measures of ice are simultaneous to make it oncluding and returned to negative temperatures.
Instead of all automatizations, smooth smokes are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo was cleaning fruits from the head to the feet and, thus, exclaimed his studies cameraries when the control of the colossal melanger bows escape him.
Master Luciano is a view that a "incident likely is risking in each course: it's only a question of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experienced genetically modified plants has affected the European Food Security Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech experts that are considered as an independent institution for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This dreams as a theory of conspiration, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information states that the President of the Efsa Expert Group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other experts of Efsa are under contract with the Press Group of Ilsi.
This last is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestl√© or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has collaborated determinedly in the development of the Ephsa test prescriptions for genetically modified plants and, in fact, clearly, in a situation of interest conflict, according to the criteria made by Mr.
The established prescriptions correspond to textually, by paragraphs, to the positions of the Press Group of Ilsi and thus carry out the mark of the industry which, on the basis, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
It's already the second time that Testbiotech denied a conflict of interest.
A high-range responsibility of the Ephsa recently joined the Switzerland Agriculture Group without transitional or without transitional period.
A few years ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) declared the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control and industry lobby, which has increased the supply of the German Federal Agency for the environment and the European Deputy.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of no interest conflict.
A opinion indicates that all of the faithful data, including the industry as well as they are a good professional quality.
It is not prohibited to experts working for the Ephsa account to re-new contact with this activities sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the international institution for the sciences of life (International Life Science Institute, Ilsi) based on the United States.
This organism is considered as a neutral forum to regroup experts, among others, in the area of science, industry and policy, to assess the risks of biotechnology without the sale of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then deem the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any food tests in animals and that they have not been tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the events of the Mai's genetically modified cause to the field" says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow to get faithful results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we then discover them?", Mr. Then asked on one of your accusers.
It's also the point of view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist conducts research since 1994 in the area of genetic and currently works at Zurich Polytechnical School.
In this region, as well as the United States, and then in Europe, the industry sector is trying to be more influenced or to discuss critical scientists.
That is why there are still some researchers who are not linked to society.
In the opinion of the enterprises, critical studies would not be published.
Mrs. Hilbeck states that "the industry controls security research."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell has seen it, at about 400 kilos.
Monday after midnight, she was looking at Stuttgart's garage with her tube in the dose.
There was a manif.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators were coming and began to demoly a large part of the north air.
The world of Stuttgart was not the same: several thousands of people have demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the center garage of Stuttgart in a subterraneous garage that will cost several billion.
A large part of the ail was in ruins when the demonstrations declined on the arrest of the construction works.
Brised in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier calculator) of Crailsheim, a pitch and a huge smoke built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor in Ostfildern.
He's looking for a few fragments.
"These stones are relicks."
"They don't have to lose."
He says with enthusiasm: "A good and good market, simple and earthquake rock."
He states that when he discovered her to the science, he heard the oor of the cigarette fum.
He doesn't even know what he's gonna do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This man of 44 years makes the trade of old stones.
He buyed all stones from the demolyment occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were concasted or if they were lost in the discharge," says he in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard position.
He states that he has made the object of insultes and amendments when the journals reported that he had acquired the rest of the North Ail to the democracy company.
But he negotiated all days with the adversaries of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to oppose the democracy.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would continue to use the stones.
At least 200 adversaries of the S21 project have subsequently imported one of the parallel steams with a average of 80 kilos, including the value between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some of them are as remembering in all hopes that they can make it in a rebuilding.
Rongen was buying 500 tons, 25 full loads of a car.
Nearly half is still attached in the forest, and the rest was sold for a long time.
Proprieters of gardens, landaging gardens, Particules.
They came from everywhere and brought all that they could enter into the coffee and boxes.
These scandal stones of Stuttgart have been transformed a long time in "Mouerle" or in the limits of herb-band platforms.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular," Mr. Rongen said.
"n't have been this political component."
He enters into his car all the ground, makes the tour of his large empire of 20 hectares.
He made the right studies he left, and later he understood to study the biologist before he interested in the computer and finally become a carrier.
And a stone amateur.
He stokes 40,000 tons.
He's taking himself in Germany everywhere.
It indicates that he's the biggest market of the old stones.
He's looking back.
Stones of sable sculpted with art are placed on the snow.
"Okayly, they were part of the Point of Marienbr√ºcke in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, tell me it with enthusiasm.
"My beloved stone."
He takes the way he goes through the forest.
He shows a cup of the pit: Pierre of red sable, first, part of the garage of Karlsruhe.
And soon.
"Joli travert."
The parallel√©piped was part of the Neckarstadion Court of Stuttgart.
In the snow of stones and storys, the traversing of Cannstat from the police prefecture, the red greenite originating from the Saint Blasien catedral, the tub from Heilbron's hospital.
What a job, what efforts, what shit!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were sculpted in the hand and moved by simple palains and carpets shooting by booves, it becomes very respective.
"It would be a scannell if such a patrimoine was put in a room."
He's not become rich, even less rich.
But this carryer works today 14 people. In addition, stone sizes, sculptor, a forgeron, a grain sufferer and a garden has been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the recycle of decades.
Next, he must go to Cologne.
There are stones to save.
Talks fighting to conquer high potential
The counter knows a living affluence.
16 Students buy themselves to buy small bread to saumon, tomate sauce, and white-manders.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the automobile Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical genius to an athlete.
In the framework of a kind of concourse of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW conceptors, and, through, to know the firm Volkswagen.
Since our days, a number of companies do not have to go to body body in the competition to decline better brain and to enhance themselves, such as Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most duplicate diplomates as possible in the amphytheaters before these lasts arrive on the employment market and they are not cursed by others.
And as universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they are trying to repeat exceptional talents in the framework of practices and faithful projects.
On the second day of the allier organized in the technical university of Brauschweig, the automobile group amadues the talents.
A young dame of personal service shares styles, bonbons and cards with the peopleswagen logo.
She talks about the Calendar of Professional Stages and Student Works to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's enhancement.
It's Nico Selle of the technical university of Braunschweig, which is responsible for the project attached to Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocs benefits for both parties: "The students enter in contact with this industry and win in experience."
"When Volkswagen group, he can know students, look at serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is innormal.
What's going on again, it's the offensive with which we're looking for attracting students.
"Okayly, the accent was raised up on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquisite of new diplomas will be better.
In the goods of the sectors, enterprises can no longer recruit their collaborators with a trial on a candidate cyril.
But they must prevent their faithfulness and, especially, the hand of highly qualified work.
These are especially the diplomas of engineering philosophers that are in a great position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German VDI engineers, more than 400,000 inhabitants were inoccupied in October.
And according to the provisions of the VDI, the empty related to engineering positions will still be increased.
Roman Dykta goes to the talents for the KMG account, audit cabinet, account experts and advice.
It organises cost events regarding the recruitment of talents, such as the KMG-Race cross course, a type of rallye-papier, where competitors should find their path through GPS coordinates.
Thus, the company will send eight promising students in the next year to see the United States in this way.
Participants may be accessible to visit KPMG branches and to recognize the company.
He who should participate there will be decided forward after two election procedures.
Only the crowd of many candidates will be turned to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the methods used for the search of high potential in universities are more important.
"We want to emigrate the lot by the cross course."
"For us, a simple cross was too little."
For the catching of talents Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Now today, we have been contacted with all people who have been part of the last year to a similar action."
"A certain of them are on the point of concluding their studies and wish to address their requests to our company."
Outside the direct emergency in the campaign, small and medium enterprises are actually classically proceeding to participate in the professional fees where they are able to be carried out to the brain.
"We're trying to get the diplomas in participating in the professional salaries."
"For example, in the Solitaire Technology room," Mrs. Sitha Stube, human resource director in Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltai panels.
This company installed at Bonn employment approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stube has known the problem related to the replacement.
Currently, 35 posts are at the concours on the site of the company.
"In this time, it's very difficult to make vacants positions."
"This cost is sweet and takes a lot of time," is he sure?
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, Friburg University.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to implement professional stages or to write his final study project in our home."
Unirous public campaigns are announced in specialists of the Sunday.
That is why the company trys to make its publicity by exercise other qualities: personalized ambiance, platform hierarchie and easy communication.
"But a large group cannot do that," Mrs. Stube, the chief of the personal.
The money has no more the main role in the research of work.
The flexible work hours, children's guard or good opportunities for promoting constitutes other determined factors.
According to a study made by the Great Place to Work, Solarworld builds the 55 place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution is an annual honor table of German employees.
In this regard, he asked the collaborators on their level of satisfaction in relation to their work and its context regarding the framework conditions of the employees.
The leader of the staff, Mrs. Stube, hopes that this place will make the image of the society to the employees.
"I think the candidates are particularly rejected to external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German DEBA (Deutsche Employment Branding Academy, DEBA) recommends businesses who want to build a good reputation as a employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He recommends his clients to show more authentication.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means to take internal measures.
"The best way for a employer to act attractive is to pass through his own collaborators," says he.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, the creation of the employer's mark image within its own efficiency.
"the comprehensive cooperators form the best messagers."
When their employees are well treated and identify themselves with the company, they only make their employee publicity with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like that we were playing in a orchestra," Mr. Kriegler said.
Obama is a french for new petroliers foreign
There will be no new forests of petrole in the Mexican golf on the breadth of Florida, the State of South-East of the United States, during the future years.
The Government of Washington pronounced a prohibition A equal prohibition and, so, finally, annuled its initial plans.
Even on the wide of the Atlantic Coast, new forces remain for now prohibited.
The Secretary-General in Ken Salazar has made this Mercedes' announcement.
This is the explosion, in April, of the "Deepwater Horizin" forest platform that is in the origin of this strict prohibition. This must remain in force at least for the next five years.
The case of this accident that costs the life to the eleven employees and leads to the largest environmental catastrophe of the United States, President Barack Obama, submitted to the pressure of the opposition and activity sector, had indicated that it was able to enable new forces in the east part of the Mexico golf.
The parties of this solution so want to reduce the dependency of the United States in respect of foreign countries for the approach in petrole.
The question of knowing who takes the responsibility of the Black Devast Marine in the golf is not, until this day, definitively resolved.
The British Petrolier Group, which is compared to the requirements of indemnisation of several billion, is located in the center of accusations.
A investigation committee created by Obama must present its conclusions on December.
In October, the Secretary-General in Ken Salazar had lifted the yellow of the forest described after the explosion of the platform.
Following this Decision, various petroliar groups had subsequently submitted requests on new forest projects.
With stronger control measures and more serious security consigns, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent control authority, which has been discredited after many corruption accusations, is currently the object of reforms in depth.
Parallelly, Mr. Obama announced them to remove fiscal nets of gas and petrol groups.
The actors of this activities sector are therefore publicly intend to maintain the fact that the difference of food in the golf would be very lower than this is the case until now.
"The objective of the Government is to make a railway to the rapid growth of the gas and petrol sector" in accordance with the result of a current sounding achieved in the sector by the BDO audit cabinet, before the prohibition of mercredied forests.
Furthermore, the American Enery Alliance deploys the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Person does not know exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been reported to the new order in the destruction of growth.
The Ogoni country is a sec
The water that is cold in the rivers is black oil; it disappears a soil like that in the essence station: Because of a fucking, billion liters of brute petrole in Nigeria have destroyed the Ugoni country in Nigeria.
Mans live in fly, corruption and steel raffination.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't move you up," leads the ecologist military to journalists to calm them: "You're still enough petrol bottle before the water length."
The Nigerian of 37 years tried to photograph a young man in the woodwater until the poetrin, and the grass train that around it: This scene seems quite beautiful in the water scream in the color of the arc-en-shirt.
We can't figure out that the sub-sol regrets brune nappes of brute petrole.
On the river of Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that, jadis, she collected crowds throughout here.
But during the time the calm waters are completely cut.
Five years ago, a large quantity of petrole was cut out of an oleoduc that explored in the great marecage.
Fisheries dwell in the small neighborhood of Bodo must then raise for six hours to achieve fishing waters: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All expansions of smoking smoking in the eye when the merchandise of manrows passed through water courses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor ship flows a cradging water. Whoever springs his hands, let all the pets cover.
Small branches of the manroth are married from the sun as reglise bathrooms. The isolated palms let their palms suddenly piece their palms.
We are looking for the clouds of birds, such as it is usually meeting in the humid areas: Since the motor stops, a fantastic silence has gone on this paradise otherwise, which seems like a service station by the horse that he disappears.
"What happens here is a war against the environment," Mr. Celestine Akpobari says, "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni lives is a war field settled since decades of years: Over 60 years ago, the first European explorers have penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because these were very dangerous for his employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is prohibited to this company: So more than 2 million of black gold barls are day-day pumped by more than 5000 pounds of forage and 700 miles of oleoducics in the whole region of Delta, three times large as Sweden, the petrolifers of the Ugoni country are inexplored, because the situation is too instable for this petrolier group.
All the hundred meters drown in the water of the acid treatles as sculpture strangers: "The trees of No√´l" are very efficiently designed the heads of forest trees.
They have to be 50 years old, most of them are broken by corrosion to purchase.
Akpobari estimates that a head of forgiving of this nature takes time in the track, because a constant floor of brute pet cold in the water.
According to the estimations of experts, more than two billion liters were disappeared on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the quantity of vegetables equivalent to the sea in the accident of the Super-Peter "Exxon Valdez" is 21 years ago, one of the largest environmental catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Who must take the responsibility of the permanent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, sabotage and oleoducation are responsible for more than 90% of pollution. Environmentalists for their part consist of the explosions of force heads and oleoduces as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner invited the Shell group to apply to Nigeria's security standards essentially less strictly than all over the world: Only the deficiency rate of training is "increasingly higher than lowers".
Some forms explore mangrouts to a place that, a lot seems like a leaved athlete, full of camboues and installed on the free air: They are completely nugged and covered from camboues to the cow.
A cyntle fire under one of the many tonnes that are often related to the ships, so much without motive on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine raffinery.
We're cutting the brush steel in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team's head.
In the first time, the penetrate essence in a recipient passed by ships, then, at the extent of the guidance of the cuposhene goats fall, and it is finally obtained from the diesel.
That is how Michael and her four collaborators produce four pieces of Diel of 300 liter: "This reports us 34 000 Naira," about $22.
The inhabitants of Delta departed from the chronic carburant penalty in the largest steel producer country in black Africa.
Nigeria's only one raffinary.
The illegal raffiners may sell to a less precious price than that ridiculally low of 40 cents of EUR per letter of Diel: because they were freely buying their first material.
This is offered by the "protectors" which put the Oleoducic network in part through the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country lost at least 16 million liters of brute pet in the entire Delta of Niger.
Only a small insignificant part of the first provisional matter is illegally cleaned: the networks of the organizated crime that also count among its members of high-range policy and military members, loading the part of the lion in tankers and bradent on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of knowing whether the environmental catastrophe or the subversive activities to the population or in the laxist production mode is purely acad√©mic.
"If the petroly society had not been persuaded as intruses and if fish lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no air and illegal raffineries."
However, at the same time, the relations of the Ogoni in particular regarding Shell have been so deteriorated that it was not more question than the retreat of the group. "That may be the operators who have other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will become better."
So, Michael becomes nervous.
"It's a lot of time you'd like," announces the manufacturer of the pet.
"The soldiers can appear all right."
If illegal raffiners are surprised by the special units of armed forces, they will not be sure that a arrest, but they will offer them pots-de-vin.
Even the soldiers of the north of the country, even as all Nigerians of the first matter.
"In all points of view, this fish thing has done to fall down our good country low," said Akpori.
Researchers discovered construction failures in A380 reactors
A380 suffers clearly a great security problem.
In examinating a device that has carried out an urgent aircraft, the researchers have discovered a possible construction failure that can lead to the "catastrophic deficiency of the reactor."
The Qantas Air Company now wants to take plainly against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In the beginning of November, the Airbus passors of the Company Quantas had seemed to be more happiness: during the investigation that it had been carried out, Australian authority loaded by air security stated that the reactors of certain A380 devices had a serious security problem, and it keeps it against a possible build-failure.
This potential disagreement may be increasingly severe consequences: It can cause fatigue crisis and escape at the level of the agreement of the oil conduct, indicated in a public position of this game by the ATSB management.
She could lead to a "catastrophical deficiency of reactors."
The Rolls-Royce reactors are concerned and equipped 20 aircrafts from the A380 series.
The Airbus of Quantas company, which had had to argue on 4 November in Singapur, was included among these.
The Australian Air Company has then committed judicial proceedings against the English producer of reactors.
She has set a judicial statement to an Australian federal court whose seat is located in Sydney, which gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against the society.
The Director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, stated that his company would recognize interests in the event in the beginning of November.
The pieces were detailed and the carrier surface has been cut down during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, this is the inflammation of oil in the origin of the defects.
After this accident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian researchers have announced that other security tests will be implemented on superjumbos that are also equipped by the reactors in question.
Security recommendations are the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, indicated the ASTB port, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The safety problem is considered as sufficient as important to report all the concerned parties.
After the airport attorney, the air company Quantas had immobilized all its floor A380 for a week.
Singapur Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa company replaced the A380 Reactor by precaution measure.
The airport at two stages is the biggest line fly in the world.
Snow crash on the entire territory provides a chaos in transport
Germany all white covers: In a night, the snow has fallen at nearly all the country.
The chaos rules on all streets, trains and aircrafts are immobilized.
At least three persons are dead in circulation accidents.
The wind brings to grelotter Germany: by glass temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered by ice night, which leads to the chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow covering has 15 centimeters per location.
The circulation is strongly restricted on several authors and on many routes.
At the National A7 in Flensburg, the staff of the Hiver Service worked permanently, but they couldn't come over the snow that stopped accusing.
Furthermore, violent rafales have bailed the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office of the Sea navigation and Hydroography (DSH) waits for this of the marine railways would be the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can get up to 1,2 m above the normal.
Snow snows on the authways and on federal routes have caused serious problems in Saxe.
That is why the Meteomedia warning center of bad time announced the level of violence was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
There were 30 centimeters of fresh snow, where strong and fresh winds were split.
Many cars and cars have remained in the night.
Even in the country of Saxe-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced severe perturbations on the roads.
On the A2 author, the snow and the wind have introduced an interruption of circulation and caused bows.
In Thuringe, the snow snow chains touched the A4 and A9 authors.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, severe perturbations in Saxe, Sax-Anhalt, Thurringe, and north of the Bavi√®re.
The major problems are: the snow on the ferry paths, the trees falling on the ferry paths, the catenarys or the destroyed eggs.
In Saxe, we had to interrupt the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, in Thuringe, a ICE train of destination from Munich had to interrupt his journey.
Pumpers and paramedics had to approve the 165 train train train passors, food and drinks.
Snow winds have snowed the roads.
The Snow Chats have introduced several aircrafts in the main airports in Germany.
According to a port of standard and information on the flights, some cancelations are already announced to Munich.
A Fraport port-word indicates that 40 vols have already been cancelled in Francfort on Main.
The hiver service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that passors associated with the airport are not more than many, although it is a painting 400 beds there is their provision.
Acidents were produced after midnight on many routes.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a train driver lost life in a collision with a train at a level.
The train driver was easily hurt.
Since the snow snow layers presented on the streets, a similar accident was not far from Nuremberg: even here, a car was happy at a upgrade past because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver lost life.
Four passengers were broken in the train, so the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
Furthermore, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a tongue on a smoking shot in A≈°hagenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be sweet and poor, but it will turn into the case of raffles.
But the wind's going to smoke.
Only Baltic Sea will be smoothed by violent and fast winds.
However, it makes very frog, at least 15 degrees by place.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for an acquirator for its jumble tours.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: According to the information reported by journals, this financial institution is searching for accusers for its two office buildings located on his seat of Francfort.
This building could be reported to 500 million Euro.
The Deutsche Bank has just come to explore the seat of the group: The smooth tours located in the Court of Affairs have been modernized; while waiting, the bankers have had to return to their old service place.
Forward, the financial group seeks clearly to recover the renovations costs and looks for a reviewer for its two buildings, such as the "Financial Times Deutschland", quoting a port.
This door-word has not indicated the reasons for the sale preliminary.
He said, "We'll check if it's more interesting to achieve our own buildings or to sell them, and to put them back in place later."
It is so that the largest financial institution in Germany has already seen his seat, a little later.
It is only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had buyed the torches for a total of 272 million Euros to own fund detenants, and then they had rehabilitations.
The energy optimization transformations have, according to certain indications, approximately 200 million euros.
A sale was obviously a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the journal, experts of this activity sector estimate the value of tours, rebapted between time "Green Tours" at about 500 million euros.
According to the port-word, we are not now known if the buildings will be sold again to a bank or a independent investors.
Thousands of people weep the kids who lost.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been thinking for the minors of emergency who have been declared dead after several explosions occurred in a min.
We were not yet able to mount the body back because the security situation of the left pocket continued to be precious.
Once two weeks ago, a violent explosion was produced in Pike River Mine near Greymouth city.
29 minors, between 17 and 62 years, were raised under the earth.
A sond was introduced in the west pit, but there was no trace of survivors.
Since the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions followed, no safe team could descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration considered that the minors had no chance to survive.
Before the bodys were able to be remonted here.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party in the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sun spreading in Greymouth in the south of the Netherlands Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 miners, we have installed 29 tables on which we could see names, boxes and lamps.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surf planes, were also their place.
The drapeals were set in front of all the public buildings of the country.
The Neo-Zeeland Prime Minister John Key told the participants to the commorative feast that the New Zealand had eaten the hope that the minors would go back to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen's son had been raised in the ships, said that he could not be resigned to accept his son's death as long as he had not seen his rest.
Furthermore, the Prime Minister and the victim's parents, several stranger diplomates have participated in the memorative party.
Miners of South African and British origin have also developed during the first explosion of 19 November.
The safeguarders began to explore a fire within the South-Zeeland mine of the New Zealand.
The police preface Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas mass are moved, burning temperatures within the mine starts down.
Go to hell, warrier!
Is the Splatter film a artistic film?
The realisator Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", epope of the fighter.
In what public can the Danish Realizer Nicolas Winding Refn think well about "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrier (Mads Mikkelsen) has only one eye made prisoner; he is free from his bowl and, with a nearly surnatural force, removes his adversaries each other after others. This seems ideal for young masculin spectators in search of a bloody action, just because our heroes uses brutal killing methods. When he is bad humor, he takes his enemies' heads without expecting that they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the movie, the bown has no word about his true name. Even the other persons let them escape, at the end of one or two phrases, some of the potential agonic crises.
In other cases, there is nothing to say and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landing of Scotland, which constitutes the Decoration of the Vikings Universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be more ideal to the married cineasts with a interest for existing and for exciting travellings.
When a movie views several cible groups, it is painful that these are usually excluded.
Winding Refn is considered, since "Pusher", his trilogy related to the pharosophic and full of style trailer, as a sort of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refused to bring a little more humor to the current dominant or to introduce a little less brutality to the art and test.
Most of the artist sympathists of the art cinema must test the horror face to the brain that spread around and intests.
The aims of action films are dead, when the boat is embarrassed, for reasons that it can be freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries in a ship to destination of Jerusalem; they are gnashed forever by calm and dream before the equipment arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It's not wondering that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only DVD format.
It's especially because of beautiful images of the measure that measured a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpiting film, from time to others, is hidden behind a pretensive and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambiance, a famous dream transformed in movie.
The spectacular can't escape it.
Refn gives him a moment of detention and cut it easily with glass images and a luxury sound band, but especially with an insisting hate that smokes from the heart of persons.
Only a young blond boy, who is faithful to the bown, keeps a certain inocence, all others are animated by wrath.
More than all, the heroes whose mobiles never are known, but who return from hell every time to fight enemies and foreigners in war may be sent by the devil himself.
He represents the persistency, but maybe it is nothing but for those who are, in any way, maybe.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that we can hate or admire, which finally has an aggression, enthusiasm and amazing.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious agricultural works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take position on this issue, even less than submitting to the controls of the Agency.
In the evening of 5 to 6 September 2007 to minuit, at least four flights F-15, the Israelites attacked a mysterious building of cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is sitting on the river of the Euphrate; the largest city located nearly 30 kilometers is Dair as-Sur.
His name is included in the AIEA documents, because it is question of the reactor that Syria has built it with the help of the North Korea in a parallele-leep of stone, designed in a valle marked by the electronic currency.
According to a letter of the United States information services, the CIA, at the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known under the name of the neighborhood location, el Kibar, would be very appreciated to produce from plutonium, which would allow atomic weapons to manufacture.
However, this technology is valid since 1950.
The CIA showed a presentation video with flow satellites images.
Following the animation assisted by the computer, she indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the central which represents a copy in the mini-ministry of the North-Corean model of Yongbyon nuclear centre.
Moreover, she presented photos showing the building located closely, seeing the inside of this.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of service, but it was not yet equipped with combustible bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have more information than at the time, and even, with the time, mystery has exposed more.
The ancient President of the United States George W. Bush recently discovered in its memories that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor in Kibar, but there was no small index showing that this country had developed "a active nuclear weapons programme".
Some of the information agents in Europe prefer to be more careful to this matter and speak only about a "prosecutive reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "plausible".
He misss tangiable evidence, as well as the AIEA.
Asked on the way he assures that he had a nuclear reactor, a high-range diplomat of the United Nations gave only a lacony response that the AIEA had "a sufficient documents to issue questions".
The Syrians have certainly removed the shadows of the "inutilised military building" and processed to a methodic planning of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of the AIEA experts conducted by the old inspector of the chief Oli Heinonen, discovered in the Kibar of Uranium traces produced by men.
Furthermore, the AIEA has received a Member State of the satellite images of trade providers showing the time that directly followed the attack. It seems that these lasts are more lower than the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because anonymous commander, maybe Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the AIEA to establish their agency in a target.
Syria always ensures that she had never implemented a secret atomic program and that she had not built a reactor.
Ladies support that the urinium found on the site provides weapons used by Israel.
However, the AIEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particules in the quality of invasion.
From that time, ladies refused all discussions about this, as well as the satellite images.
Furthermore, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of El-Kibar and refuses access to the constructions destroyed by the bomb.
However, even Israel keeps a silence obsession.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then the Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said, "We will never make comments on this issue."
It is so that the investigation on this matter takes long since June 2008 without a result and that it is "transformed in a serious problem of credibility in the Agency", as it recognizes a western diplomat in service in the AIEA in Vienna, finally is a serious violation of the Treaty of Nuclear Discrimination.
The AIEA considers that in order to realize progress, the existence of the three other installations must have a "functional report" with the current reactor.
Finally, the inspectors have not indicated what installations it is here, or what is their function or what we suspects to contain them.
According to the information published by the Suddeutsche Zeitung Journal, they are known in the AIEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the name of the neighborhood cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) of Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf, which would probably be one of the subjects.
It is possible that it is in a military or directly near this; it is exactly why Syria refuses access to three sites to the AIEA inspectors.
In Vienna, the Syrians claim that the inspection group is actually springs that would be sent in the name of the United States by the AIEA to spy military installations.
In fact, it is an information provided by American secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The AIEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the parallel steel to transport substances.
A western diplomat of high rang stated in Vienna that at least one of the installations could "serve the production of the combustible."
It would not have "no indications on sensitive activities", such as the increasing and recovery of urinium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor works sure through the unenried urinium.
However, it exists in the richness of the plastic hypotheses on the following fundamental issues: from where the urinium should come and where the plutonium needed for the production of the bomb would be separated later.
It is ignored if records, which could hide traces of large value, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of loaded trucks are lost, no one will have any information on recording location.
For the AIEA, it is less probable that Syria had achieved in 1998 the mine of al-Tibni cell, located only at a few kilometers of El-Kibar, on the other side of Euphrate, to see if it can agree to store radioactive decades.
Recently analysing photos taken by satellite for the shower of the Jane's Intelligence Review, the old inspector of the AIEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between these and the questionnaire.
However, photos taken by satellite show that Syria has entered landing works in the three subsequent sites and moved large contents when the AIEA started to require access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but it has not contributed to escape the supply.
It was said in diplomatic environments that the AIEA has passed for a few months to develop a plan on the inspections to do there. This plan was to allow Syria to keep events of military secrets. Only the investment time shows what great interest in the inspectors are carried out to this matter.
During this time, Damas also finished this proposal.
A year ago, if western diplomates in Vienna did not have been made of the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be signed for this matter, for example, Glyn Davies, an ambassador of the United States, who announces the special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Atom Agency is available to open its controls.
The Director of the AIEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had had to propose these inspections, has already already spoken about "the option I'm opened in the future", but he has yet.
This means is a great risk: one part is required a majority of the AIEA Governors Council and a great number of 35 countries who are represented there is no way to see the situation to know a scale.
In the other hand, such as the diplomat that gives it to say, "Isn't it that he would, if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in war
It's wrong since Angelina Jolie's beginning was as realistic.
She wrote the scenario itself: it's a story of love between a original woman from Bosnia and a Serb or original man.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to provoke the disease.
A permanent rumeur indicates that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love of her Serbia's bourreo during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Bosnia female federations were immediately protested. In response, some tournament sequences in Sarajevo have been moved in the last minute in Hungary.
At times, the film is turned to Hungary, but in the post-production phase, Protestations continue in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnia Journal, Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women ' s victims of War has addressed an correspondence to Angelina Jolie by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and requested to meet the act.
She wasn't diplomated. Some weeks ago, she proposed these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but these have stated that offer.
"The meeting must be in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There was no loving history in concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario said enough about his attitude to the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic was then recommended to the High Commissioner of the United Nations to remove the quality of good will in Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his scenario, gave a copies of tourization to Sarajevo, but we don't know why it wasn't then come through this authorisation.
The young author assures herself that she does not continue political objectives with his film, which is, in the way it has been achieved at the Jugoslavia conflict, and it supports that she wants to exercise the terrible consequences of war and give all the parties to express.
However, it remains vague about the content.
It's also a second synopsis of the cycle film on the Net. It's too different: Lovers knew well before the start of the war. He met again when the woman, a Bosnian muslim, is deported in the Serbia concentration camp where the man works as guarantee.
What is even a great difference with the version "A victim of violence loves his bourreo."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure that exercises on it, thus expresses Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information."
Then, only Hollywood's fanatics can find him peace: by putting this scenario illegally in the Net, as well as others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, it's going to be good again to the Irish.
no consternation trace.
That is why the local team dominate excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans smoke of joy on the basis of a strong music, they throw feet.

This strange spectacle is called "bever-pong". The gainer starts 500 euros more airballs, allowing him to go to assist in January in Las Vegas in the campaign of the beer-pong world.
Cian Tanner is a quiet person; this subtil game to drink and the reserved information, these two behaviors are not really well together.
Yet, however, the young man of 26 years looks for a pleasure, turning away from the territory question, what will be moved on the future.
The pleasure to play in Las Vegas is not found in its projects. In January, he will lead embattery in New Zealand.
"I'm trying, however, a strange feeling," says he.
"The birth country is so far and I don't have a job."
Finally, her girl waited for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she decreed her job as a load of event project, maybe a good sign," said the young man, a dreaming.
Because of the dark perspectives in the country, two of the three of Tanner's sisters tried their chance to be foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, resident in Sydney, his brother Colin now buys an informatic consultant post in London.
Youths are going: The situation of most families who live on the island seems to tanner.
The experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicate that 100,000 Irish will closely leave their country.
They also offered a number of 200,000 migrants from here to 2015.
This represents a great loss for a small country of 4,5 million d'habitants.
If these provisions are accomplished, it will be an emigration course comparable to that Ireland has suffered in 1980.
After a decade of economic boom during which Irelands have played a great assistance, the chagrin will then take all the place.
However, the economic crisis involves in particular the young Irish, well formed, which have not known until now.
The loss of employment and social detention was absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everybody had a job, there's a lot of money.
But, at least, three persons at least 30 years are at the assembly.
The Irish Times magazine publishes the letters of readers made by young emigrants, which are pleasant: "In Ireland, everything is going to derive."
"It should have a highlight against politicians and bankers, but he who has the possibilities is going and our country so is a generation."
"The last to go out the light."
Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish students' syndicate, sees a more dark future because the Government only makes the puzzle to the eye and offers no perspective of future to young people.
"They reduce the minimum salaries, but they have no strategie to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years.
She sees how her companies are cramped from a practical stage not paid to another.
She states that they are the biggest suffering is to emigrate themselves in four years.
"It's a sad and depressive thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to face this subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" room that offers a entire support on the theme "Working foreign".
"But foreign work is an extraordinary opportunity to make the first steps in the courses of the professional herarchie," says the responsibility.
His web site shows the photos of surfers in Australia and the surfaces of neighbors in Canadian.
The message is clear: Working foreign is not a galery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
Since six months, Sean O'Donovan, he knows what it means to be based on others.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year engineer, then he worked with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction and Germany sector.
A mode house just out of the land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
At least, O'Donovan only visits his birth country, because he participates in a additional job position, so that he can finish the contracted credit to build his house in the birth country.
"The situation is already a little pengue," says he, raising the ground of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I won money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live not practically anymore."
He smokes a river smoking through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a resident area with gardens of good-being, cooked cars of large marks are stationed on access paths.
Four years ago, O'Donovan buyed the house in common with his sister for a total of 380,000 euros, financed to 100 per cent by credit.
"They were moments of fool, without doubt, the money was easy," said he.
Did he fear to see everything grow up because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a moment, resort from the tea and says, "I have no children to handle and I'm young; even all go through, I can distribute to zero."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears these last time.
"Person has not to suffer hungry, but our situation is not even so dramatic as what we have lived in the island again."
"Travail for a moment in the foreign, it's not what can happen worse, maybe it's what we first felt of Irish.
He stretched and then talked about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years ago and, in Ireland, life continued, just."
This idea pleases Cian Tanner.
Let the future go and find out how life happens.
In his palmarian, he has already counted a few years of work in London. That's why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girl.
But there is another thing that worries it well these last days: the party to organize at the time of her 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's scared that she can't be transformed at the evening.
"Only, not many emotions," he said, drinking a long beer.
"Anyway, it looks like the same worried."
"Let's calling this about a evening to see, every resting, gathering a few friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as the private company.
The crime has become a greater concern than the challenge.
And Brazil is seen as more influenced than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer's late 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the sound was regularly implemented since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two linked elements are the results of this year in September and at the beginning of October.
First is the humor enough insolidated in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the democracy and its main institutions.
The support for democracy has increased sensitively in many countries around South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth has increased in average 6% per year since 2002, the support for democracy has passed from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
He also increased in Mexico, where the economy was renewed after a strong decrease of the production last year.
But only the half of the responsibles in Mexico and Brazil, the two largest countries in the region, are convaincus democracies, which makes down the regional media (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region‚Äôs response has been declared satisfied as their country's democracy worked in practice; it is the same number as the last year but with a strong increase in 25% in 2001 (graphic 3).
Some 34% said that they trusted the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as the last year in the two cases; but in a strong height in relation to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
10 years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have developed support for democracy.
If this has been good during the World Financial Crisis, it is certainly necessary that many countries in America have only been a short recession and have benefited from a strong recurrence.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America has reported this week that the proportion of the Latin Americans living in poverty has increased only in 2009 and has reached 32%.)
But the humor is significantly different from one country to another (see graphic 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his President out, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, were translated by a largely part of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have been aggressed.
This is only the second time since the sundage has started only more responsible for Latin America in its entire assembly, the crime has been census than the commitment as the most important problem for their countries (see Table 5).
At least 31% they say that themselves or one of their neighbors have been victimed of a criminal act during the expired year; however, this number is low in relation to 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A stronger economic performance is reflected in the support of the private company and market economy: about 71% of the responsibles of the region say that private company is essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see graphic 6).
Some 58% believe that market economy is the only system that will make their developed countries against 47% last year.
It is interesting, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their left president Hugo Chavez is exempt of many private enterprises.
Brazil is the greatest men in the region, mentioned by 19% of the issued persons (including 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, changed in relation to the last year) and Venezuela (9% low from 11% since the last year)
However, the United States are considered as the most influenced country by the respondants in Mexico and in the largest part of Central America, while Venezuela plays this distinction in Equator, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An exhausted vote
No one expected to have perfect elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the left and steal in fear.
The new scrutin boxs and a new scrutin, vote bulletins spreaded in the goats, sacated vote offices and intimidations
The vote offices would work later night.
Many Hattians, including many who were moved after the January series, would be mistaken in the nearby to find where to vote.
Some of them have finished to leave.
A twelve candidates to the President, including several favorites, have denied the fraud and rejected the reception of the election.
Protestations, sometimes violent, exploded through the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the high officer in Haiti of the United Nations Organization, considers the event as "a lot of choices in good ways."
Observatorys of the United States and the Caribbean Community have clearly stated that "their irregularities, even seriously, have been necessary to invalid the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, which is revoked by the opponents in Rene Preval, President of impopulation, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second turn is prepared for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, an old lady, were removed from their initial call to the vote to be declared no.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has a little or not perceptible support in the electoral authorities, is stated by the electoral authority as having achieved the second turn.
With a collar epidemia that makes racine, and more than 1 million survivors in the seisme that still live in tenants, it was afraid that the participation would be.
In the prison, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were stopped to do it because of the disorganization.
Before 2500,000 identity cards, needed to vote, they were not yet distributed a little while before the election.
The enemy is important.
Donators see the election of a popular and legal government as a important step in the Rebuilding of Haiti.
And so it is clear, the Haitis do it themselves.
The point of feet to the center
The weeks after being suddenly wide, Cristina Fern√°ndez, President of Argentina, benefited from a public sympathie vague that improved its approval of 20 points, more than 50%; it was its highest level since she was chosen in 2007.
However, transforming this in a successful campaign for a second mandate in an election in the next year, it could depend on the election of Mrs. Fern√°ndez, visiblely in delight, according to which she would leave or not the infringement of her marriage, predominant and old political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this case, signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to maintain economic policy, even after his wife succeeded to her as President, had the use of developing budgets that were undertaken by fiscal resources, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to expenditure additional income.
The Government of Ms. Fern√°ndez has lost his majority in the Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has been able to deal with Mr. Kirchner in a heart crisis on 27 October.
Some of the members of the disasters of the perronist movement to the power have been advised to Mrs. Fern√°ndez.
But after the chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary has broken on the face of one of his parriers and where others have accused the Government of Corruption), the Congress does not approv the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss me," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied on the next year, leaving to the President a larger margin of manufacturer to expensive voluntary.
Economies are widely surrounded: it is obvious to grow at nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11,1% but many private estimates and the salary revendications of syndicates are seeing this number close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took its functions in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of an economic effort, made a priority for the growth and reduction of poverty, instead of control of inflation.
He refused to be treated with the FMI, he harvested the private sector and purified the INDEC, the statistical office, which processed for statistics on official inflation.
Mrs. Fernandez, can she now modify these policies?
She called to parks between private enterprises and syndical leaders.
And his officials say that they want to limit payment increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
However, the inflation has increased the rate of growth after a strong assessment in 2002.
It may be the reason why Ms. Fern√°ndez shows signs to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the obligatory who had refused to restructuring an ex-forged debt restructuring for which Argentina had not established its events in 2001.
Now Ms. Fern√°ndez seems to be edging towards a agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it has some $6.7 billion.
Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that it could not imply a monitoring by the FMI, as it is costume.
However, last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economic, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to provide a new national index of prices to consumption; that is like a prejudice of the INDEC instruction.
It is not clear if Ms. Fern√°ndez wants to stay in the policy beyond the end of his mandate, now that his husband is not at its side.
If she does it, she needs to win the support of the media class, among which the kirchnerism is very prominent.
When Argentinas are returned from their age vacances in March, the sympathy vague for her would have flown.
If she wants to win another choice, she should decide to repeat or not, without a dream, of many political policies of her husband.
A half-hour for China
Taiwan electors are oriented to a sort of more extreme unit with the continent.
What is Taiwan thinking of his big brother located on the other side of the detrite?
More than 7,5 million electorers have been presented on 27 November, or 70% of the admissible persons to elect municipal and counselers in five citizens, in the framework of what is considered as a general evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Myself has become a replacement for the feelings in relation to the continent, renewing newspapers, including a party free movement, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My test was successful, but it's just.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) has submitted three of the five maries, he failed to load the majority of the voices.
Instead of this, the Democratic Democratic Party (DPP), who has reached the full independentness of Taiwan, has submitted about 50% of all votes for the CMT of 45%.
If this was a presidential scrutin, Mr. My would be difficult.
Since he was elected two years ago, the vote part of his party was about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attacked electors, even with KMT in municipal advice.
The event has devoted most of the main subjects of Taiwanian elections, including shipping campaigns and mass collection draps with girls who danced in minimum holding.
An attempt to mysterious committee was also perpetrated.
Sean Linken, son of Lien Chan, honorary President of the KMT, made a electoral turn for a KMT candidate in the field of the election.
A man of the people shot on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, the wounding and killing a past.
In fact, it wasn't determined if the challenge wanted to do evil to Mr. Lien or to set a different difference with the candidate.
However, Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspect on the DPP and turning the electors to the KMT.
Maybe the greatest winning of choices was the Chinese.
He was struggling to consider how much the question of the continental party she was absent.
Instead, the candidates have made the plans for public lives and the creation of employment.
Taiwan usually played his independence of fact and hates the military threat of China.
So, the KMT tried to abuse his links with the Government of Pekin.
But this time, the DPP also refused to attract anti-Chinotic feelings.
This is the answer to a new consciousness that Chinese enterprises are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, was a confirmation to know whether its political policy was acceptable for the Taiwanian majority.
It may be expected that the Government of Pekin continues to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategie that is to take Taiwan back to the market.
China has not lost time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summary on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would like to see a political integration, but let's begin by the beginning.
It is better to wait after the Presidential election of 2012.
The DPP has been renewed in any way.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his old boss, Chen Shui-bian, was sent into prison after corruption accusations.
President of 2000 to 2008, he was a prosecutor for an explicit independence.
But a new generation of models saw the day under Mrs. Tsai and the PDP worked all in order to attack professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was held as a candidate of DPP to the President, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
They're in training to do his best to show that he can also go to Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans destined to an expert panel to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, in order that their treatment could be located without preliminary conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanian public that its party presents a "alternative worthy of confidence" in relation to the precipitative approach of Mr. My on China.
Mr. Chen seems exaspered by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that the candidates of the PDP would have obtained better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a different country.
He also commanded Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to break the President.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will be bad to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT must make a self-specific introspection.
Mr Ma's assessments have been low; although a serious economic growth, the candidates of KMT did not want to campaign with him.
His impolarity seems to be in a large part due to the comfort and the extension of the fashion between rich and poor.
A KMT port-word says that his cabinet and its local antennaries will be transferred.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan's support for the refugee is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanians see the economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an exciting editorial, "the point of not return has already been past."
Nominations to Grammy Awards: the song of Jazz Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
The request of a President, and the people have to take knowledge.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist of 26-year-year-olds in the hand by President Obama to produce in his ceremonie of the Nobel Price of the Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a great nomination of investment in the category of "the best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a very known figure on the jazz scene since his album of 2008, "sperance", the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards, which an artist does not have to go out more than three albums before registration; that "the public identity of this artist" is "the public identity of this artist".
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", marked a step before and, given his lightly engaging vocal style, his hand of pop and function and the Latin influences, is possible to draw at least one line marked in Spaling on the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the most closest equation for the Grammy Awards electoral electorers, having a number of jazz products in this category for these last years.
Furthermore, the Grammy Awards electorers have just honored the "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the "instrumental album" category, a virus on a reorganizing fresh of a record that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Of these Iyers, "Moody 4B" of the saxophonist veteran James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will be particularly in competition.
Trombone Shorty, contributed to the rack voice of the New Orleans and invited frequency to the "Treme" of HBO, has been honored in the contemporary jazz category, which also includes strongly to a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of Darcy James Argue, familiarized with the steampunk, has won some good recognition in the great category together; in competence with the rich room-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal aventurer Dave Holland, whose album "Pathways" of his okte's lives was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this basist as a group.
The name of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey bring in classic categories
The classic names for the 53th Years Grammy Awards include a measure of musicians and composers of the whole world.
In the head of the names, Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machine" citons, for the planet and orchester, with five "ye" and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electronic orchestrale work, with three "oi".
among the names with links with the South California, there is the Eslovian Arvo P√§rt composer for his symphonie #4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commanded by the Philagnetic Orchester of Los Angeles and opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the Composer based on Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also free for a reward.
The classic names are divided on 13 categories covering orchester records, opery, choral and soil.
A category for the classic manufacturer of the year is five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic album are the Symphonies n¬∞3 and 4 of Bruckner's King Orchester of the Concert Building; "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" from Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of Castrati" in the way of various artists; and the "Requiem" Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opery, the names are "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Loin's Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Encanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchedrin and the Chur of the Th√©e Marinsky; and "Ivane" of Arthur Sullivan of the National Orchestra of Walles.
The composers that are located for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count P√§rt for the Symphonie No4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Apassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffati" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Encanted".
The Symphonie No4 of P√§rt had its first in Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the philharmonic Orchester of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pecca Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-management of Mikhail Khodorkovski, officed in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was called for his soil instrumental service with an orchestre.
The Composer of Los Angeles said that he first wrote the work of 15 minutes especially for interpret to the Mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Joint, sitting in New York.

In the category of classic measures, Soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her record "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Muskee of Temecula submits the approval of the Planning Commission.
A project of muscle in Temecula received a single support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testing, often passive.
Criticals have been taken to the project intended to promote so many terrorisms and training emergency.
But the commissary stated tomorrow night that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be extremely impressive.
"More people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha√Øs, you mention it," said Hay Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the Jewish word tomorrow.
"I'm honourable as American citizens."
"This shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 18 hours and was at least midnight with, most of the time, people pronounced themselves for or against the center, at the time of word at least also distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the journal.
"There's no more America," wrote a interviewer.
"It's a different planet of songs with Miss Liberty died in the sable."
"America has fallen."
The Islamic Centres planned have also submitted protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, location of the attention of 11 September 2001, perpetrate in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denied violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families in the office of Riverside for years, but she wanted to be a larger and better space than the treatment that she held on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minerals and would rise up to 43 feet high.
She was occupied a location of 4,32 hectares on Nicolas road about two miles at the east of Chaparral school.
The opposers can still call against this project to the municipal Council.
A microwave tolerant the arsenic takes the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of a strange bakterie, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutrient elements, extends the field to find new forms of life on Earth and may be there.
Although researchers have discovered the normal battery here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has possibilities besides the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can be developed with the phosphor, or with the arsenic."
"It's why she's very particular, even if she's far away from being a form of life really stranger," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona, co-auteur of the report contained in the newspaper of Science.
Six major elements have been considered as essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, azote, oxygene, phosphor and suffering.
But the researchers discovered that the bactery, discovered in the Mono lake in California, is to continue developing after the phosphor was replaced by the Arsenic.
"We ask what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the research of life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which has not developed the details of the foundation, has generated specifications extended on the Internet according to which the report could develop the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
The "detecting that, in other planetary environments, organs could be used by other elements to action the biochimie and that the whole "standard" of the elements, which we judge absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, teacher of the Planetary and Spanish Scientific Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of a element to another in fundamental biochemics and biochimical structure," adds Cockell.
It wasn't a strong discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, who directed the study, chose the Mono lac because it is higher arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphor are chemically similar; thus, it has specified that a microbe exposed to the two substances may be able to replace one to another.
"Arsenic is mainly toxic because his chemical behavior is really like the phosphor."
"It is therefore bad to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the Arsenic is sufficiently different that he doesn't work exactly as the phosphor; he penetrate inside and, in some way, the work of our biochemic machine," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected the known bactery under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing arsenic concentrations in which she could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphor, but the fact that he can live with the arsenic in the place is raising the possibility that a form of life that uses the arsenic can be produced naturally, otherwise on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Professor of Microbiology at Florida University, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphor, was not new; but nothing has shown that it could go.
The arsenic was more frequently at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said, so the researchers have exceeded the hypothesis that the first forms of life could use it.
This suggests that it could have other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth has been formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was financed by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two rolled exposition dogs were found in Compton
The two other dogs of exposition on four flights outside a motor in Bellflower have been found, the officers of Los Angeles have announced it.
The four exposition dogs - two acids and two pembroke gallois corgis - have lost married when someone robbed the Chevrolet Express carrier in which they had passed night outside a Motel 6 of Bellflower, have announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were receipt after midnight, and the other two were found at the end of the evening, said to Steve Whitmore, the port-word of the officer of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They are in good forms."
"They have been restored to their legal properties."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what quarters and what circumstances of their discovery were.
"A research is running."
"We don't want to say," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The dogs owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a Jewish comment.
They were meeting lunch after midnight with their two Akita in a refuge for animals in Downney.
The members of the sheriff found the car and the two dogs separately in Compton.
Acitas - Trace, a 3 - year - old man, and Didi, a woman of 10 months - were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had prepared to show regional concours this week, for the account of the owners of Japanese dogs, were taken away until they discovered the Mercedy evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in the city this weekend in the framework of the National Campionate "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they count Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competition of other tests provided for in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", said Peek at the Mercedes Times.
South California is one of the stops of the Canin exhibition tour of nearly one month of the couple.
Monday, Peek and Rickard checked in the Motel.
They often remain in the words and keep their room outside, just near the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs - a chat Boxer, a territory Parson Russell, and a Breton Spanish - who remained with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, in the farmer room, in the car where it would be more free.
They have a little open windows, so the dogs can have free air.
Peek and Rickard reported the vehicle at 6 p.m.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgies, munition of an implanted micropuce to identify them.
It's not clear if a reward has been obtained by Jewish.
The lion is ready to rule again, the MGM restructuring is not expected more than the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally received the green fire to start at zero.
A Federal Court of New York's Facilities, officially joined the "pre-amballed" plan by creditors according to which about 5 billion dollars of the debt would be efficient; opening the path to the divorce company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on production and distribution of films and TV emissions.
With the judicial decision, as the plan satisfies the requirements of the Code of Federation of the United States, no legal obstacle exists before MGM to flow under the basis of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the general guidelines of what will be attached to a study.
The personnel will be returned at about 320 to 400 to the department.
MGM will not really exceed from Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not conclude a credit facility for $500 million, provided for to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed by the investment bank, which is worth $75 million, and should be financed to half December.
The study restructuring process started in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was committed to advise the direction on the way to place its funds since it had no way to pay the interests up to 300 million per year.
In August, the Director of General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old PDG of Enron, and a restricted expert for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's trials to resolve MGM financial difficulties and to satisfy more than 140 creditors in the study have taken much more time than proposed.
After a few months of discussion, the parties have agreed to put the company in sale at the end of 2009.
However, the sale to the employees took a little ministers among which no one of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 billion more than the creditors were in research.
At the end of this year, the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan, which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially exposed from failure in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies receive prices of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1,2 million will receive a payment of $9,5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $3750,000 per month for their business management services, will receive a "price of success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum accounts to renew the MGM production, which was only one film this year, and put a yearly list of seven or eight films that would go out from 2012.
They also want to co-financing two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a separate price between $265,000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which must be completed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who deserves about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to realize a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main activist.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not been agreed.
Games Tech to maintain your challenge budget in equilibration
Although the main candidate for the best playing of this year is the IPAD, it may be, perhaps, by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, both can make an important bit in your challenges budget.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five balls BMX to 99 dollars and that a game Kinect costs the same price as 10 branches to save classic perles, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to maintain your challenge budget in equivalence.
Recently, I visited three national shoes of games - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has developed, the technological game of this year is obvious to have more strength; although the same price is a little less, compared to the last year.
Furthermore, while there are often less new games associated with websites, two of the most known guys, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And Button ball games are increasing, as well as reloadable ball games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" us, except if contrary indication.)

Appoint a more deep side to maintain the order in China
Tang Shenbin arpented a place of the city as a citizen officer in training with severely inspecting its nervous loads, with a lower voice of orders with a military authority.
He wanted that the female members of chingguan - responsible for the public order in China, fearing and prevented for their arbitrary repression and their pending for violence - transmit a certain impression to a total of spectators.
"You have right!"
"It's amazing!"
Show them, he said, "What do the beautiful girls seem like?"
Four girls who had worsely passed in white guests, clothes and similar olive color pantalons, were fished at the guard.
Four pairs of black shoes to the ball, justified to the rule.
Four chapels are perfectly sounded because of the hairs attached by a blue and white hair.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with dead.
"The models are happy."
More than one government tried to refresh the picture of the cities in China.
A city required that all new recruits were a higher study diploma.
The Province of Guangdong has changed the gris-verde uniforms against a blue-wheel more engaging.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with a strong way: in 2009, a report report reported that 50 officers had explored an uncontrolled skank carrier by launching black looks, closely for a half-hour, until the colporteur had finished his business and part.
Xindu, a citizen district of 6800,000 residents in Chengdu, chose to make a great image operation.
Since 2003, the district completed its 13 women in the middle of citizens, especially selected for their appearance, their branch and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a more degree, more female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to look at this subterraneous cities of China
And for reason, the critics will say.
In contrast to the police, these agents are only authorised to respect municipal orders by imposing amendments or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media describe the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei were struck a observer after he used his phone to film them in training to spread protection against a discharge.
Last year, a training manual for P√©kin inspectors, deroted and online, describes how the deliants efficiently winning without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a passenger had been abandoned with a cerebral lesion after a bagar with five officers.
An impressed video game of violence, available by downloading online, shows Chinese inspectors formed by the assault of travellers.
"Chenguwan marked the government," declared the last year of China Daily, a national publication, after a first pol√©mics on taktics.
The journal claimed a full purchase.
The septicals say that the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announce in October to find eight new female recrutes, an editional, in The Beijing Evening News, was asked if women had real tasks or if they were only a tourist divergence.
The answer seems to be a little of the two.
The announcement of the district required female candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years, having a beautiful silhouette and "the five faces in the good order."
They must have a greater size than the average, or 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1‚ÅÑ2 pounds.
The retraction to 26 years is obligated.
The officers stated that the work was physically painful for women over 25 years.
"This is their image which is important," said a certain district officer in Rednet.com, a case-governmental website.
"Firstly, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, the weight, the face traits, etc."
Then the temperature and "internal qualities".
The women in Chengguan are like flower vaccines, adding, "In addition, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, adjoint director of the office management of the city, does not apply to this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sex.
This is the case of the requirement related to the order of the face treatment.
That means beautiful is a discussion between the Chinese.
Certainly, persons who are hunted or designed should not be posted.
"We can't leave a person who boss or a boss come here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the place of Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the games in a finally incurved mouth.
She doesn't consider the value of her appearance as being sexist, she said.
"Do you think I feel sexy in this uniform?" she asked a disappointed air.
Xu Yang, his colleague to the 21-year-old shits, said, "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their mandate to be limited, because they eat more carrier ambitions than to just cast the soldiers in the roles where they are census to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen walking markets that move fastly to feet or floor, trying to sell the most possible of small bread or tofu balls before you take the flight.
"Master Wang, you have to go."
"We have already told you a few times!", Mrs. Xu said when a soldier was running on feet, for a temporarily left his steel-charrett to news.
The agents describe their functions as a monotones that are ardues.
"It's at least the same thing each day," said Huang Jing, a 20-year-old, who studys marketing after work.
"Green routine."
One of the reasons is that women's agents do not have the power of their men's homologs to trust the goods of the sellers.
They can only be threatened to notify the contravenants to their husbands.
This means to protect them from sudden public expositions of anonymity against the bureaucracy common in the whole China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, were revolutioned after the propagation of rubber failures according to which the Chinese agents had killed a soldier.
In one night, more than a twelve police agents and chingguan agents have been wounded, 14 cars of the Government have been broken or fired.
Xindu has escaped here for such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Only two houses of the place of Baoguang, where women's sexual officers patrouillated this morning, more than 50 people were gathered together at the road.
The agents have established a motive that was intended to be repaired on the throat instead of in a magazine, as they impose the regulation.
The moto owner cried on the scenario.
A 15-minute ferry arm followed before the police, on the left face, a road of cooking to their vehicle and go all quickly with the moto and its owner.
Li Juedong, 40 years old, a coordinator associated with the masculine team, remained behind, his white bathroom returned to hide his name.
Like women‚Äôs sex officers, the coordinators of 40 years or more - play purely a role of support.
In contrast to them, they are not formed in order to maintain a circle image.
"Therefore we're struggling."
"It's sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said about your neutral.
"The most time is the public that starts."
Procureurs will not find Senator Ensign
The Procurers of the Ministry of Justice have taken up criminal accusations on Senator John Ensign, declaring a case linked to an ancient campaign assistant and its efforts to get a lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the lawyers of the senator.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat of Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, which was considered as a possible republican candidate to the President of 2012 until the scenario around his business would make the great national titles last year and drown his carrier.
The office of Mr. Ensign stated that he was "hearted" by the decision, resulting from an investigation of a year.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Ethical Senator Committee.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign stated that the Ministry of the Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign had no longer the investigation object and that he had no intention to maintain any accusation against him in this case."
The Ministry of the Justice was absent of comment on this matter.
The announcement has come as a sort of surprise for many external attorneys in the Ministry of Justice, in which there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on the lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first communicated in October 2009 in New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying work to win Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the business of the senator with her.
Ms. Hampton once served a treacher in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funds to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then he defend their rights after they have committed Mr. Hampton to lobbying for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law to make lobbying to his old employee or Senat in his together.
The ethical experts support that the inhabitual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were near friends before the matter, seems to be contradicted with the prohibition of the tower door of the lobbying.
According to the proof that was published, "It seems to have a primary evidence of a commitment to violation and sustainable violation of the tournant door's law," stated Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington who is specialized in the defence of customers of a government.
Although the Court of Minister was refused to explain the reason that the decision was conducted in the Ensign Affairs, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed to meet political proceedings after a number of high levels reached by its section of public integrity, including the decisions adopted in the last year to absorbed progress against the old senator Ted Stevens.
Federal procureurs clearly feared to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a group of defence that received several statements against Mr. Ensign in the business.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Mr. Ensign, announced in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up on the next day, saying that the Ministry didn't seek accusations against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the procureurs to try to persuad them as the senator, as his office reaffirmed it in a communicated, "he had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to determine the legal arguments that he had done in the park.
"I'm not at the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have taken the good decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Commission of the Elections decided to leave an investigation after an independent statement by the Ethics group, supporting that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign to Hampton had violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral committee stated that she had not enough evidence to prove that money was only a gift.
NV Energy, a major company of Nevada who has so long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton to find the lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company accepted Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, the captain of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, had communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he would "martel" the Ministry of the Interior on a question in bed.
Mr. Ensign also participated at a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allgiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transport to establish a meeting in the name of the air company after Mr. Hampton had committed a lobbying.
When the news of the business have been surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign was excused with his electorers and sent his leader's position to the fourth Republican range in Senat.
After holding a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he had the intention to break a third mandate in Senat.
By preaching that Mr. Ensign was no longer the objective of a criminal investigation, his door-word, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator would hope that the Ethics Committee would immediately follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and would finish his investigation.
The Senator Ensign rejoiced to continue his work in the name of the Nevada people, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half-douzain of them was training from far away in the front of the audience room.
They sent every minute of terrible witness reports through Twitter.
At the end, the defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the process of violence and children associated to their bed in a house that was burned.
Jeudi, the largely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was recognized by the murder of three members of the family of Cheshire, in the Connecticut, should be moved on a official end where the judge would impose death pain, voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already placed elements to the Court that require call arguments, which are responsible for the courts for years.
What is caused is that the intense reports on the process - as well as the generalized and expanded use of the Twitter journalists - have created a " cyrk atmosphere ", a saturation so extended and instantly with fire details that the jury has been infected by public passions.
The request may take the challenges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in audit salaries.
"I have been experienced in this process; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in audience salaries at the rights of the person to a right process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer of Mr. Hayes, a lawyer.
The Court of Court, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, convinced the revendications in the court last week, confirming that the media were "soundly controlled" and that there were no evidence that the jurisdiction would be given by the passion.
But it doesn't seem to be the last word on the question.
The call courses are recognised since decades that medical coverage of notorium cases can raise questions on the equity of a process.
In a sentence of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the condemnation of a Cleveland Osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting his decision that there was a "atmosphere of carnaval in the process" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some of the inspiration for the TV emission and the movie "The fugitive".
Some lawyers stated that the challenges courts entered to see a half-year century later the condemnation of Mr. Hayes may be curious by the argument which new rules could be necessary to manage the methods of communication of audience salaries, inimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"It is a general reason to concern the impact of the new media" in the great envergury process, John J. Donohue III, a teacher in the school of Stanford who studied the death pain in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue states that some call judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instant communication from audit salaries could allow more right.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by the lawyers of Mr. Hayes, which is supposed to be discussed for years.
For example, the lawyers of the Defence, for example, would be a prejudice when the Court of Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurisdictions by showing photographs of criminal scenes in the election of the jury.
Some of the jurys have stated that the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The lawyers of the Defence claim that they will also condemn the constitutionality of death pain and that they will suffer that the judge has unjustly ejected one of the jury, which was critical before the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure for a verdict, taking into account the innormal decision to bring the jury to declare in a weekend.
The jurys have not been safe.
However, their arguments on the effect of the intensity of the medical coverage of the process could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a contempt against the verdict, deposited last month, that the case dominated the median scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates to the Government and the United States Senat.
They have maintained that the computer media would stop attracting the flammes of the business emotion.
"The day-day box of media twitters, camera and journalists before the court palace," the lawyers wrote, "not seemed like nothing of what had been seen before here, New Haven, and perhaps the national scale."
Their accent on the coverage of the Twitter system is against.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement, according to which new instantanities were more incendie than the communicated lately, was a humanitarian view that would prove the policy of the Court governing the medical coverage of future processes.
However, some lawyers stated that the call courses were often attracted by the arguments in which social and technological changes needed adoption by the judges.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this revenue.
In their documents, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had rejected the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard because of the mediatic coverage of the process, and they declared that they would call new rules for the new media.
"This thing," they wrote, "respecting the Sheppard V. Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can civilization draw close to the climates?
After a campaign marked by invective and negative campaign, a minimum civilization spread in Washington this week.
Is it a sign forward from a real cooperation two-partial to the previous or an illustrial moment before the rapid return to the Partisan fight in the capital?
The March meeting between President Obama and the Leaders of the Congress has not produced a view to the major issues that should be treated during the "Bootball Canard" session.
However, at least there was a political discussion on the differences of the two parties and on the recognition of their responsibilities participated to government, instead of another episode where each camp was wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of the Commission on the deficit of the President was also civilized, although the political differences remaining between members.
It seems clear that the extreme interaction of several months has established a mutual respect through the ideal weight, but he is still divided by the members.
It's enough to say that a new time of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a temptation and implementation of mutual tests to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, although trying to assess the limits of public opinion and patience of electorers for a renewed partial war.
That is why the March meeting and the later comments of the participants have devoted a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and deep to suggest a quick change of climate existing during the past two years.
As regards fiscality, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain a thousands of distances.
However, the election of November was moderate by Washington at least in the short term.
"He doesn't doubt that things have changed on the ton", said Pete Wehner, a officer of Bush, now near the Ethical and Public Politic Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections suffer party passions, and then they are extomping.
It's good."
On some questions, in particular those on the agenda of the "boat canard", republicans and democrats have no other choice to find a solution.
Bush's fiscal reductions will be expired at the end of the year, and nobody's doing so.
Both parties want to find a way to keep a part or a whole, permanent or temporary.
In the same way, a compromise is considerable on the extension of employment advantages, it would not be because the republicans can not allow the impression that they are for the reduction of imposes for riches, although they refuse the disabilities of companies to workers without work.
After the March meeting in the White House, more optimism plans on a possible agreement on the issues issued during the "Bootful Canard" session with the ratification of the "New START".
But William Galleston, of the Brookings Institution, warned that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session would not be forced to make a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th congress will be gathered in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is probably inevitable.
"When things must be done will be, psychology in the short term will be returned to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his largely shared scepticism according to which civilization would lead to a real cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or a shadow-boxing in relation to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons of this are extremely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority to the Chamber and the electorers present to the tea contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are conscious of dangers if they are going too far, they know that they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce public expenditures and to abuse the new law on health care.
These partied positions are already clear in the first reactions on the recommendations of the Deficit Commission that include reforming the income code and increase some imposes, reforming the age of retrait and reducing the expenditure.
President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, the question of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 voices to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as official recommendation, and they have been bad to achieve this number.
The greatest resistance is among the electors of the group, which suggests that it is on fiscal issues, at least today, little motives or commitment will.
Galleston provides two phases in battle between the White House and the Republicans of the Congress.
The first year will come under the form of partisan advantages, since the Republicans contain Obama's budget, imposes and health care; and then they will be followed by a larger bipartite cooperation.
What would the cause of change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proved that, although the spirit is party of the recent election, a majority of the Americans always wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation brings an impass, such as in 1995, both parties will be carefully observed by the reaction of the public.
He who will be judged in loss should change and find compromises.
But it would be a optimist view.
The partisan spirit and polarisation are today greater than they were not in the middle of 1990 and it seems to have a greater ideal excursion between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress that there was not between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, military members of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prejudice to a most successful election in 2012.
With regard to this reality, the exposed citizenship of this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more efforts from the part of the two parties to find an understanding land on the issues that still divide them.
United States developed documents describe Moscow as a favour of corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocracia" and has passed to Kremlin a part of the pots-de-vin and the money of protection that she collects, reported the United States in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service do great rackets that contribute to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect the money not only of legal companies but also of organized criminal groups.
Each board of the bureaucracy - what the first Minister Vladimir Poutine called the "Vertical of power" - takes his part so that the money chemist to the top of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources which the names have been expired.
She was reformed when Jouri Loujkov was still more in Moscow, and he has been responsible for corruption.
It was conferred in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there was a little cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a first plan-building company, has always been raised to corruption accusations for years; and he won several processes in divorce on these accusations.
In September, he explained what was followed by a Russian television chain, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt, "It's crazy, it's going to go, it's nothing."
The Russians believe in a surprising majority, that their company is corrupt; according to the summers.
But it is inhabitable to find the information held in an emergency account; and it is inevitable to convince that it would be diplomates of a stranger country to do it.
The direct link established between the Government of the city of Moscow and the criminality led some people to the name of "disfonctional" and to indicate that the government worked more than a cleptocracy than a government, according to the note of the embassy.
"The criminal elements play a " crisha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " toit " or protection), which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, and through the Office of the Government of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a structure at three levels in the Moscow criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on the top."
"FBI, MVD and Miles are at the second level."
"In the end, normal criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the low level."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups compose an empty in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB takes the money of the largest business and that the police targets the smaller.
A source, he said, "It explained that the owners of Moscow undertakings understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (instead of groups of organizated crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by the law. "
"This is why the request of protection by criminal gangs is not too higher."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is expanded, the protection itself can be inequal; even those who are patients are sometimes submitted to a arrest.
Those who do not quickly see their affairs to close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev several times called the fight against corruption, but he adopted the little progress.
The note of the campaign is transferred by rent accounts made by men who bring valids, probably full of money to Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrates," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of a political class because there's no existence in Russia."
Without political, without opposition, without separation of powers, the corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indian, the costs of corruption would be higher than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country was classified in 154e recently on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental Organization of Transparency International (the countries are classified at least the most corrupt).
The divulgation of the note of the American embassy, which was not realized only yesterday, after evening, in Moscow's hour, will exceed with confidence of the disagreements within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blamed in some way, for Moscow's mistakes, it might be the opportunity for Kremlin to show that it is in the way to resolve the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Poutine expressed the hypothesis that WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturer and reacted to the proposals that the United States diplomats had developed by Batman and rapped Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem looks on the fact that it is our interaction, a major factor of the internal policy in this country, said.
"But to be honest with you, we don't doubt that it would be done with such arrogance, such a pressure and, you know, in opposition to the ethics."
The old fighters of the Red Khmers committed to face the past
In a bad class room with walls in beton described of bad quality, the director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng called the man who had built it, the last chief of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"All this world loves your Mok."
"It was a good leader, and he felt suffering his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
It is known as "the smoking" for his brutality, when he was on the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of old Khmers in the north-west Cambodge, where he has built hospitals, pounds and other infrastructures; and where thousands of old soldiers of the organization are still living today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, long date loyalty was finally delivered to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly to people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the Government has distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the story of the Khmers' Reds to the children of his old soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodge court, jointly guided with the United Nations, announced his first sentence on an old member of the Red Khmers, in condemnation, at 35 years of prison, the old chief of the fierce honourable tour center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, the best known in the name of "Duch".
Before this evolution of the situation, anxiety increased by the old fighters of the Royal Khmers of Anglo Veng; compliant the efforts of reconciliation and their desires to reincome to the Cambodgean society.
"There are repenses and fears among the old Khmers red, but they are impossible to do whatever it is," said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodge Documentation Centre, an independent organism who carries research on the system.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions in families."
Under the Royal Khmers kingdom in Cambodge, from 1975 to 1979, about 1,7 million people have been executed or have been dead of hunger, disease or overseas.
When the Vietnamese invaded and turned the Government of Pol Pot-Uni in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodge with Thailand.
There they have launched an insurrection that has long until the last movement is running in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary leaded the guarantee of their base located in the west mountains of Cambodge and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared along Veng.
But in the middle of 1990, after a peace agreement compared by the United Nations led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of red Khmers started to defeat the Government, and moved with the captulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died from natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had had been captured by government forces in 1999 in the near Dangrek mountains.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 waiting for his process.
Without their favorite, most of the old khmers who fighted red khmers have cut down in the black mixture, common in the rural regions of Cambodge; and many are those who remain nostalgic of movement.
Although some of the red khmers elite officers have kept their local managers in switching the weapons, it is a non-quality agricultors in low grade and material.
"These people have benefited very little after the capturation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums in the whole Cambodge, including Anlong Veng.
"They are impressed of the gracious UUOPical Ideology of the regime."
"They were high in a frame where business is a stranger concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Khmers as a boyfriend in 1974, was fighting in the jungle around Anlong Veng before installing in 1998 as a poor rise culturer.
"The life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"Tha Mok eat everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to bring our own needs."
The Court of the Red Khmers, currently, has also provoked concerns here.
The Court should, at the beginning of the next year, take the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another old Khmer's Red Minister.
The mandate of the Court is to judge the high leaders and the principal responsible for criminals, but he didn't say if he continued for these four cases.
It would need more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The last mediatic speculations were turned to Im Chaem, age of 64, old director of district in the provincies of Bantaay Meanchey under the kingdom of the Red Khmers in 1970.
In 2007, she told the researchers of Cambodge Documentation Centre that she had monitored the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced workers would find death.
Recently, in a tourism night, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located near his house in woods on pilots, on a land route outside Anglo Veng.
While the sun threw long shadows on the smoke, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go there.
"The Cambodge is in peace and stabil," she said.
"If there are more continues, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has defected the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned that an instability would happen if the Court continued several suspects; although experts and historicals say that.
"The Cambodge needs to build a skin and enter the past," he said.
But to face the past is what Cambodge should do forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to reconnect the boxed tracks," said he.
"We have to put these tracks together to understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Campeon, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as additional to the story manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like in most of Cambodge, the young people of Anglo Veng know only some details about the Red Khmers, unless the town links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old, studying at the high school of Anglo Veng, stated that the new manual helped students to understand a major part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are worried because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance made the complex and difficult reconciliation process, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers keep a powerful attorney here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the bad herbs and parseed sacks in plastic, led to a black sue rectangle, covered from a rounded round tower.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pneus ball after his death in 1998.
Niom Sothea, a 31-year-old age, a portable phone sale in the road border, said that she did not know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many inhabitants will go to pray."
It was Nuom Sothea's anniversary, and, after that day, she was planned to go to the last place of Popot's rest, where she would leave a smooth bananes in the hope of bringing the chance.
Bielorussia accepts to renew its military quality stock
The Government of Bielorussia announced mercredi that he wanted to leave his urinium stock highly enriched, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is included in the framework of a surprised victory of the campaign of President Obama to ensure nuclear materials in the whole world
The Agreement was declared in a public communicated communicate after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, in march of a summary on security.
The American government tried for years to convince the Bielorussia to renew the urinium highly enriched and seemed to have disappointed the horizon to the last printemps.
But the American responsibilities told Washington Post that some classified operations were made with Bielorussia during the past two months to eliminate 187 books of military quality urinium from a research center of Bielorussia.
This has opened the path to a mercred agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 libres, according to a official who has expressed the conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the question.
The Agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Assembly of 47 nations, organized at Obama initiative; where Bielorussia was excluded.
It appeared that it was profitable to find a invitation to the ex-Swiss Republic after the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact they want a seat in the nuclear Security Summary 2012 Nuclear Security Summary."
"This proves me that this process works," says Ken Luongo, President of the World Security Partenariat, a group of promoting nuclear security.
Clinton qualified the agreement "the very significant, important step" made by Bielorussia.
Obama was invited to Prague in April 2009 to ensure all vulnerable nuclear materials throughout the world in the four future years.
Since then, the Government of the United States helped six countries to depart from all their uranium highly enriched.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have made it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Sommer on nuclear security of Obama, Bielorus President Alexandre Loukachenko stated that the nation would never renew its uranium.
"We have watched the urinium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially of the military quality urinium and the urinium increasingly enriched," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"This is our product... we're not going to build sales bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus has been close to the United States for a few months ago, however, in demonstrating the interest to come to a agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the Urium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material was easily irritated, indicated responsibilities.
It was loaded on a special train that has passed over 1300 miles to a installation in Russia to be stored and eliminated, they have indicated responsibilities.
The second operation was finished in the morning and was made by air, according to the responsibilities.
The United States Government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of the Bielorrussy with the low urinium; inadequated for weapons.
"A coordination and a minute organization have been carried out in order to strengthen confidence", thus conducting the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a responsible for the specialised energy department in the World Meaning Reduction.
According to the estimations of the Education Centre of James Martin, Bielorussia had at least 88 books of military quality, and hundreds of miles of urinium highly enriched.
The Bielorussia seeks to remove its stocks from here to 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Bielorrussia and the United States have been treated for years, mainly because of the sustainable repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But mercredi declaration would suggest a potential renew.
"All by welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that a great respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Government has no objection to the CIA flights
The Government had no objection to the CIA flows with Talibans and Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the United States Ambassador in Madrid.
This is shown by the documents filtered by Wikileaks to the day El Pa√≠s, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government in that time, Mary Teresa Fern√°ndez from the Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive should be informed to ‚Äúthe fact that they would have exercised an adequate monitoring on the foreign aircraft that had passed through Spain‚Äù.
In June 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe, which accused compliance in human rights practices with a 12-year-old country, between Spain, has been a meeting between the ancient North American Eduardo Aguirre and Fern√°ndez of Vega.
The Vice-President recognized that the report of the Council "with surprised the Government of Zapatero out-you" and insighted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"The Vega has submitted that Spain has no objection in respect of intelligence vols above the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid "to take them to the depour", reports Aguirre in a cab.
The Officer of the Foreign Ministry of that time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive would "with the lowest possible profile, even as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
At its tour, in January 2007, Mr Vicent Gonz√°lez was transferred to the Amambassade, the fact that he would not lock the court's initiative to request the declaration of the documents of the National Centre of Intelligence (CNI) and the Ministry of the Defence on the CIA fleets.
"This report does not contain any incriminant elements, no sensitive information," explained the Amanda after he had talked to the prosecutor.
The United States showed even their concern for the "aspect coordination between the Spanish Court and German Procureurs" more than for the information declared by CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will fulfil our efforts to maintain discrimination between Governments," advised Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a dinner between the United States Ambassador and the Ministry of Internal, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba, he commented that "be even if the Spanish judges are independently disappointed by his independentness and will do what they agreed," he gave instructions to his colleagues, "for the comments of an inflammed rhetoric, trying to refrain the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the PP action in this matter.
"Instead of its general orientation of Pro-American, our experience suggests that the PP will certainly take part of any indication in which the Government of Zapatero has taken or delegated the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these reveals have negative consequences for the Government of the United States."
The park that passed to the birds was able to be mother
The young girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "There to the galaxian."
Monica Juanatey Fern√°ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With the name that she used since she was small, communicated with a cosina and at least one friend; the two originals of Noia, the village of the Korean where she is original.
Messages are data from 2008.
To hear them, it is necessary to know his feeling life that ABC built with the help of the witnesses of his parents.
The young galician girl began a relationship with Ivan Tu√±ez in 1998, industrial.
Their relationship has been a year.
Soon after they were separated, we knew she was born.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex had never left him to do the DNA test.
We discovered another new little friend after that.
Elu was Alberto, a young man of Lousame, a nearby municipal.
With him, she's a long time with her.
Cesar lived with them.
When the young girl was gone to the Balear Islands to sold the work market, the little left with her partner, who even took her a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, we hear that their ideas have been fragmented, they have been separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and weird for the fact that I came to work."
"When I told him it, it gave him a good thing, but, of course, he now takes account of what he means to be with the child all the day and doesn't have freedom to do what he wants."
And then she talks about a mobile message she just received, "I want you to return this month or you give me a address to send the child to you."
She explained, "If this doesn't ask her, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I will take it when I come back."
In May, she talks about her return to her village, "This week I'm going to go, but I'll stay there only until 19, because 20 I have to present me to a job place to not lose it."
She explains that if she was okay, she would have taken her age with her.
"He will stay with the right person, it's like to say with me, and I will never leave it from my life with another person if this person is not my mother," doubts, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she was locked, it was supposed that the child, who came to the island on 1 of this month, and he was supposed to be killed at 10, was dead.
"Cesar's happy of one side, but he's not of another."
"It's with me, and this place is a little pleasant, but another is going to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.
"He's going to go in a few hours of age, and so I'll spend a little money from the baby-sitter."
On 17, guests and claims.
"A very big bishop of Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto said he sent you I don't know what videos on the mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
At 30, another, "The kid's good, he's going to the earlier time to learn the Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He's going for me."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manage.
She had one of her in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberatory of prison."
"Terror to the galaxian (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, watching, tells his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was past because she didn't tell her the fact that she was a famous mother.
Monica has been entered yesterday to the provincial penitential penitentiary of Palma, provincial detention center of Minorque.
The office lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she didn't remember how the facts were past, "and she didn't want to do evil to the minor."
Before she had noticed that she had gnashed Cesar in the bathroom and put her body in a valley.
Defence and prosecutor were concerned with a psychiatric test.
The members of the Popular Partie would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decided in Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona municipalities.
After the important increase of votes and deputed votes recorded in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already reviewed the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the perspectives are more positive, because the number of votes that this training has obtained in these double commissions usually that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the populations of the Catalan have received 610.473 votes to the generals of 2008, while at the autonomics of 2006, they have obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC had 384.091 votes.
If this achieved trend, desired by a decline of PSC votes and the confidence of the PP electorate, the analysis of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could have passed from 8 to 12 deputys in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (in the time 10) and the PSC would lose even less than 9 deputed (a 25).
These calculations would be considered that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, ERC would lose a deputy - there are three now - while ICV would keep a deputy or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next day would have been located in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where the population can also be decided at the end of the social hegenium in the four capitals of the provinces and in their relations to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulate the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
As well as nationalists and people agree with the fact that the PSC could lose the marriages of Barcelona, Tarragona, Larida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain the most of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
With regard to the revolutionary debuilding, it would not be fantastic that this training loss its representation in Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% of the votes.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decision-making force in Barcelona, Larida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they may be the protagonists of the smoking in the capital of Tarragona, where they have governed the PP before the current socialist master, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP has recorded only a variety of 500 votes in relation to the PSC, such as angel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found many times.
Populars have also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalan and encourages to form lists in a maximum number of locations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
At the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistans and Nigerians held by the General Commissioner of Information of the Barcelona Police formed a Jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Terre of Tamil" (LTT) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's attacks, which had been killed by 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interns has granted great importance to these researchs, in order to ensure that with the "Kampai operation" the failure device of Al Qaida on international level and "for its operational capacity".
Researchers calculate that the cell, during the two years in which she was active in Catalonia, could send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy of Al Qaida to the European borders and other west countries with a total impunity.
The remanent cell is the only that the Jihadist network had operative in Europe, so it is that in the researchs participated in Thailand services, other European police units, so that in the territory of the European Union, it may have the following days of the same challenges in the night of the past March in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (on arrested the Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeria Babtunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, the Pakistan's capture of Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan H√©san Butt and the Thailandian Sirlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who led from Bangkok the cell implanted in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - which a part was broken in 2009 - was mainly volving tourists who satisfied the conditions marked by the "Islamique Mondial Front".
The documents should be named young men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without printed visa.
Researchers underline that until now, there was no details that connects the arrests in Catalonia with Bombay's attention, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the recipers of passports flying in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is necessary to remind the fact that a few days before this attention is commissed, Catalonia sent it through a transfer agent a few thousand dollars who were "investis" to buy mobile cards that were used after the "command" integrators who killed 106 persons.
The Police has made an extra documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend the fiscal compliance
The PPC Leader, Alicia S√°nchez-Camcho, had the opportunity yesterday to expose personally to Artur Mas its conditions to support its investment as President of the Generality, identical to the exposed in the campaign, and to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the missing of philosopherians as the economic complicity as the nationalist wants to be approached to the half of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic Populars has come to you with Artur Mas with security that has received 18 deputy elections the past Sunday, more than enough to love it, because the CU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will exercise the oppositions in the vote of the institution.
In an possible understanding with the PP depends on the future associations that nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but for the time, the conversations that Ma has those days with the rest of the political leaders are closed in the Catalan.
And in respect of the President of the PP, to support an investment "the needs to remove all sovereign and independent talks" and the economic complication - similar to the Basque country - that the leader convergent wants to even submit to the referendum.
Both leaders are common to make the political apparatus of a very exagerate autonomic administration and the elimination of the imposition applied to success and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the Investment of Mas will be busy from the PC, Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcerc√≥s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laport (Solidarity Catalana).
The generalistic states that the dead have not been two of the "measures"
The owners of the Centre of Olot does not exceed the possibility that their sick of night had killed more than 11 age persons
The responsibilities of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to subscribe the prejudices caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilm√©, the infringer who killed at least eleven age persons who were responsible for the range that he worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was presented by the lawyer of the center, Joan C√±ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be the able to exercise the accusation against the responsibility" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility are obligated to assume the processual situation of civil responsibility."
And on the basis of social discreditation that the entity can suffer to not detect the criminal activities of the night infringement, the great threat for La Caritat now takes a significant indemnation that the legal representatives of the victims are already calculated.
Joan Vila Dilme suggested that the first crime date of August 2009 and that since that day he was not stopped to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exposure of eight body - old patients of the geriatric - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the decades but, given the age and the pathogens of the patients, the formality was made by phone.
The Caritat, through his director, has set the category yesterday in this situation and stated that "the missing of measures can not have been at no time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an impressive index of any other person who is not accused."
The person already baptized as "The Ange of the Death" announced 11 murders last night and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and half later, he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he offered death by injecting a superdose of insulin, in different ways of the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pastilles.
The Director of La Caritat stated that it was complicated to control the access of the personnel of the Centre to Medicines.
Insulin injections and seat cocktails were the mechanism used in six of nine crimes that insufficiency, in his desire to delay the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analysis clear if Vila doesn't lie saying that he was looking for his first victims a less cruel death or, in contrast, he burned them in the interior in the damage of the seems like he had already stated that he had done with the three women who killed in the interval of 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the declarations of the defense of the night, not even the number of offended murders, they do not exceed the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the various versions of Vila gave in its visits to the First Instancy Court and the missing logic in the change of the way to murder after he had been committed with eight murders.
That is why they say that they will stay in the provision of justice to clarify the port of facts.
ECB amendment
Investors have reacted severely yesterday to the threat of Trichet, which prevented that "marks do not have to highlight our reaction capacity."
The differences of the devices have closed in force and the actions of European banks have increased more than 5%.
However, we don't have to increase the ECB's capacity to stumble, and the euro has increasingly recorded an increasing increasing sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market, which, as it grows, is reached, but motivated by short and very specific positions.
The institutional investor will be late to lose the fear.
One month ago, the ECB urged us today to remove liquidity measures and must be retracted tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank required the finalization of the public achievement plan because of its inefficence and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures and allowing only unexpected access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended at least to March and maintains the sale to trimestrial gains in the end of the trimester to ensure the liquidity at least to June.
We hope that we will continue with the commitment programme of obligations and that we can even give the signal of the intention.
If they do not fulfill the generated expectations, they will turn the great reaction of the market yesterday and if they continue to reach the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
While during their meeting of May, they said that they didn't even consider the commitment of obligations and have covered the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be believed and permanent.
In May, he announced bazooka lunch and mercredi he said he had already buyed a lot, in order to make a new effort on the market.
Yesterday the end of treatment for a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Tresor has only exposed 500 million to 5,28% in relation to 750 million to 4,81% of the previous enlargement.
Even so, the types in Portugal have lowged 30 base points in all the core, and clearly reflecting a change of market feelings after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the numbers of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated numbers represent 10,000 million short terms and 15,000 potential, and they have a period until February to get from the private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no confidentiality after he has discovered the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are subject to the Assistance Plan and helps reduce incertainty.
However, on the next March, the Government should receive Parliamentary approval of its new budget and there is no sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in an insurance family.
Angela Merkel moderated the tongue of his conversation to leave the tension before the next Summary of State and Government Leaders on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a unit and that we all interpret the same party.
The problem is that German wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the weight of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministry will approve Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate the employment sounds to the hearing of investors as Vivaldi's four entities.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that Spanish Bource has increased 4.5%, the double remaining of the European Bourses.
In the absence of February, the reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank has been quick and radically and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a key commitment for a three-year commitment that will be beneficial by the Trichet effect, so we hope that this is resolved with a strong request and helps to disclose doubts on our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask a Assistance Plan would be a auto-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Tresor has more than 40,000 million in liquidity, the triple in relation to March, very loved types, and they cut the access to non-day markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the wife of Cesar, "instead of being, the appearance."
Courage, we can get out of here!
The President of Eulen will refer to the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The temptation does not stop in the conflict open in the front of the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will be considered, because he consists of "no right," the Court of El Enero 16 next, concerned by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assess their majority and to comply with organs of management of the officer of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus, David and Mary Joseph, give their legal battery for the new chapter of their lies to control one part of the group.
The maintenance funder of business services for companies does not appear to be able to cease in his ligue to be present in the El Enero Director's Guide Boards.
From his administration advice, it was excluded by five of his seven sons who were named Administrators in the Assembly of Actions of 18 January this year in which the contemporary is registered in the trade and society Register.
The judiciary advice of El Enero for the next 16, invited by the Madrid Comercial Number 2, opened the Toner box in the Alvarez family again.
The advice to the Court to establish the Assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that ensures the convocation of the Assembly.
The last movement of John Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "request of the demanders of his five sons to try, through a processual argument, with clearly violating the Law and violating the right, correcting and correcting the assembly rarely none on January 18," according to his official ports.
This argument will be the basis that, once the meeting has been established, it is convinced that it is "in full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet discreet, have already tried without success that the officer calls a assembly in June.
In the Enero, a patriotic and titler society of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other active, David Alvarez's sons control the 100% of the capital.
However, the funder of the service group of concerns the use of 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the fundamental question that the judge should decide after hearing on the request of contestation for which there is no more signed date.
Red Bull triomphe in F1 with a secret gun of Siemens
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
While Red Bull was entered into the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, his story was marked by surprise and success.
In the first time, no one has not taken into account the options of a new ecu that came to arrive, although the trajector at the last income, the last November, in the last phase of the campaign, they all have seen on Ferrari de Fernando Alonso triumph.
Without lowing the habileness as a pilot of the campion, German Sebastien Vette, not yet the capacity of the Renault engine who explores his car, in the world of Formula 1 is talking about the legend of the "secret weapons" that the multinational Siemens company put into the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a guarantee team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that German company has launched on the market in 2007 with very distance objectives from high automobile competition.
PLM, this powerful information tool was used to create mount chains of manufacturers from all the world, energy stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate the product or process before build it in a real way, thus disappearing the evacuables and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon photo devices, Sukhoi airports or most precious useful vehicles in Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its form 1 allowed Red Bull to create and execute "In a few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during courses and tests.
Russwurm explains that the ecuations of 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their teams that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles every saison.
In the Red Bull team works today 180 young professionals of high quality, who, with powerful computer equipment equipment, analyze and project any kind of changes on the balls.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull, except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
The materials, combustible, aerodynamic and safety elements are modified.
Changes can pass from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours through advanced production systems by laser and high-technology keys.
As a single limit of this flash of the technological perfection there is amount of 40 million dollars that each form 1 team may be limited as a limit of each saison to facilitate competition.
Red Bull implanted high-technology use to create and produce its bullies in a location to 50 km from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
All that happens here is considered "top secret".
The personal for this deal 580 persons, including two pilots, Vettel campion and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, of course, is the recent campion Sebastian Vetell.
In the large technological resources that the energy drink mark has made its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, which are inestimable and notoriety.
The technology director, Steve Nevey, states that five years ago, we could indicate that the progress of R+D in the case of training cars were 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
These percentages have changed today and technologies represent 85% of success, while the pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey states that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "they are invisible gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Barcelona invested his first exclusive magazine in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 business network between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational needs to be installed in Spain for the next two years.
The company will calculate this initiative with the 16 areas already presented in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court of English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave for example the remanent magazine located on the Grand Via de Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which it works 30 years ago.
The North America Group prepared a plan to implant 200 points of market sales in Europe in 2013, including 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opens were those of Bucarest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona was the third.
Mrero didn't want to reveal the next possible magazines, even if she said that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Directory of HM personal systems ensures that the philosophy for the implantation of the magazines will always be the same, with support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American Group advises and takes care of the concept of the exclusive magazine mobile (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which will have a similar image in Europe.
Moreover, HP covers the training of the staff.
Helena Herrero noted that it was a French system and sublined that the exclusive trade network required "for improve the service offered to customers and PMEs in the achat, assistance, post-20 and even emballage".
Barcelona's magazine includes a space with a worldwide pioneer pilot program that results on the potential problems of the HP computer equipment in guarantee.
A online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So, in 10 minutes we can resolve problems that often can take even two days."
"This system is especially designed for MPES and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," he noted here Helena Herrero.
Sabadell stands on 'volver' a million clients in his river in three years
More optimist than other leaders, the Delegated Administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Despite this, he proposed an effort of interest margins, that it would be trying to compensate partly with the commitments and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to catch in three years a million of customers, his job to fulfill.
Sabadell found a way to explore during the three future years and could survive so in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will take a new director plan in 2011, which will hold a three-year vacation.
The objective, in particular to survive without need to achieve the public subventions of FROB, is to win a market cost by capture of a million of new customers - 700,000 if it deceives those who could go out of the bank, its great task to be fulfilled, because this bank has guaranteed more PMEs and society than the special client.
This year he took 250,000 special clients and 50,000 companys.
Its market cost for particulars is 3,5%, while it is over 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the parse of productivity, or what is the same thing, external, with the reduction of costs as objectives, which results will be explained by the bank when the exercise results.
A few banks are now able to establish objectives and to make them publicly, because the financial crisis has decreased all the plans of the global bank sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will end this year its plan of Director Optima, has established four years ago, even if the plan was first for three years, but the market situation has determined its prolongation for more exercise.
The customers who let the equipment boxes be their main objective.
During a little lunch organised by APE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "diffictional and transcendental year".
The executive, actually, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "late night."
Moreover, in two or three years, it will be "the very difficult to create workshops", which is fundamental for the overliving of the bank affairs.
And even if he thinks that the war of the passif - which penalizes margins - reduces the price of risk prices that banks and boxes pay for its emissions to get liquidity are already moved to the credit price to compensate margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on the credit."
"We didn't lock the robot, but the differents are higher," recognized Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the credit long-term and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD√≠as of 22 and 27 November.
He also announced that the trend of the bank sector now is "the increase of the committees," but "and there is a competitive framework."
The Sabadell director plan is based on the organic growth even if, asever, the group does not remove the possibility of corporate operations.
It's not in vain that he ensure that in Spain we're going to worry about greater dimensions.
"All will move the next year," he assured.
It indicates that capital requirements "greatly increase" and some Spanish financial entity could be entered into the red numbers.
It indicates that the FROB can replace the market in the fund capture in the case of new rehabilitations.
After ensure that Sabadell could survive at the time closement of the market, he reduced the importance of the fact that some bankers already preach as a new liquidity crisis.
It signs that it can't be expressed, but, in contrast to what happened in June, it can get from short-term financing through relaxing, which affects the crisis.
The CECA rejects the possibility of a second vague of fuel between the boxes
The General Director of the CECA, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, has rejected yesterday the possibility of a new vague of equipment boxes and has incentived the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is implemented.
When the concentration process of Spanish equipment boxes started, there were several entities that ensures that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the General Director of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses of Espagnas (CECA), Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, has rejected the possibility of production of this new operation vague.
"I think the largest part of the fusions has been completed, we can't say that the integration of Cajasol in the C√≠vica Bank is a second phase, that's a second phase."
"The majority has been completed; it is possible that in place of 17 to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been fulfilled under the rule of the Spanish Bank, which has also cooperated much in this operation," sublined the manager.
In the statements during a small-term party of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragin (ADEA), Olavarrieta expressed that the concentration process is "to the greatest speed possible and we must be very satisfied by the way it is accomplished in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Spanish Bank."
"The transition of 45 boxes with a average of 28,500 million volumes of activity at 17 with 75,500 million is an unrelated process in the history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to be in accordance with Bael."
Olavarrieta recognised that "There's a series of thoughts enough happy on the process reader" which showed "the missing of seriousness and sense" because "the Spain Bank has done is to remember that we must respect the period before the end of the year."
The General Director of the CECA, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, confirmed yesterday that Spain has the most severe financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world and has assigned to people who are sure to put it a "manage of knowledge".
The Leader noted that, when the current economic conjoncture was given, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and boxes of equipment, a system that started a "three important" concentration process and "wave the greatest speed possible".
He also mentioned that the Spanish bank sector was well explored from the striking tests that the ECB had made in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but he has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have proceeded a double government response.
On the one hand, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which vary fiscal reductions for the PMEs, regulation of private placement or suppression of 426 euros to assist officers without professional contribution to the privacy of 49% of the AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the lottery of the State.
On the other hand, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the elder President Felipe Gonz√°lez, joined the critics of the chance of Angela Merkel in respect of its responsibility to delay the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It is necessary to notify that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its communicative policy.
In addition, it is another restriction of the difficult redefining process of euro.
And there Germany has a radically new view of what it must be its future, which is going to keep the old traditions of most of his partners.
The European Restaurants, in Germany, starts to split on the three possible challenges of the crisis.
First, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of Mark, even now, looks like the science of fiction, with a very favorable thinking, about 50% of the population.
Third, a new concept of the euro, online with German proposals for a larger macro-economic control, budgetary resources, amendments to countries that are transgressive, possible payments for one of them and extension to the private sector of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it is long as it is defined, so now there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when FMI and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany thought to do (function and stability of public financial plans) and what its European partners, including France, worked.
The second side of the Central European country was when Mercel had difficultly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
Since this time, she made the object of a Feroze crisis, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were against the Greece's rescue.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel expressed a clear position, requesting the reform of the Treaty Reform of the Union to make possible the resources of a country and to obtain private charges in the same time to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, because she precipite the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, although a little wedding, has been approved and, in the next month, we should assist the Union reform process that will make these measures possible since 2013.
German has tracked a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she said to all of us that, even if we now have to take measures with which it may not be too agreed, from that date the old euro function would have finished.
2013 will indicate the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries who persecute rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be obligated to be declared to stop payments and, in this case, the private sector will also support a part of the costs.
Germany indicates that we must follow a severe growth path with high levels of equipment and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in production and competitivity and positive external soldies.
An alternative based on the debt and building, with a large weight in the balance of payments, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will not be just tolerated.
The mission is clear.
And it would be bad to not listen to him.
It is not only to reduce the public deficit at 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much more hard.
And what he doesn't really need to do in these circumstances is to do ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulencies will come to us a greater silence.
And that we can introduce the opportunity that we have given to us, until 2013.
It seems that the President Zapatero also heard of this form and its double statement (the promised reforms after the meeting of the sabbath meeting with great businesses and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, although Mercel's critics, we have opened the way to the threat that we have to order to the house.
But the red line that German has tracked is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considered, we can't exclude it to leave a monetary area too far from a few serious countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraude of the law
The Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax showed the insensitivity but not the desire to escape to a sanction.
The expression of ourdia in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the date of 23 November against Ajax in the Chamber Ligue of Champions made a lot of increasing on the anti-sport character of such conduction and if both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match finished (their team has already won clearly), the two players have perished the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrary of showing them the second yellow card.
So, and see that Real Madrid will end by being leader of his group, the two players will fulfill the regulatory sanction during the next match of the barrier match against Auxerre and can pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA disciple committee sanctified with two matches the team trainer, Joseph Mourinho and various economics to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow carton in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but most often in the football world.
She is so excited that she is part of the etos, non-scrited rules, but followed, of that sport.
A part of the discussion appeared in the related case, it must have been a protagonist team of Real Madrid's entity (which in his hymne shows the nobleness and honor and in the past occasions he has condemned a amendment to his players for analysis acts) and the orchestrated dramaticisation, it seems that Mourinho, which adds an episode of more to his historical and provoking technology history.
In any case, the debate requests whether this type of conduct does not explicitly prohibited by the regulation against the principles of the sport, it is, if with these actions, it is a weakness of law, because they are actually respective actions with the sport regulation, but it seems to exceed its sense.
The question is to consider the type of prejudice that they provoke to the sport.
One of the goods that comprehend the sport spirit is the physical integrity of adversary players, a aspect that with these actions has not been in danger, is that there is no violent game.
Another of these goods that we are attached to the correct game is to abuse that the team of infractors benefits in an unjust way of the team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not agree that it is normally characterised as trichery or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been made in secret to try to escape the sanction, but their action has been exactly the most clearest possible to receive the penalisation of the armor.
They waited and accepted the sanction volunteers.
Another question is the type of advance that infractors receive the reviewed mistakes.
Here it seems necessary to convince that it is not in a situation of disagreement in the rival and we have no benefit in the same match more, since the result of the action is of course to leave their own team with less players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously, the progress is in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Ligue of Chambers without cartons that can be misleading their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term price, with a certain grade of indetermination, because the team could be removed at least and at least, with this action, the players fulfill a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards is produced with less than the first cycle.
So, to write the scales, it's not so clear that it's a profit.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which is even part of the decisions of strategic decisions that favore the benefit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (that would really be a clear case of the law's fraud), in the case they chose the time they were submitted to it.
They have adopted a strategic decision without walking in penalty or escaping it.
Even if the border between the genius and the weakness of the law is differed, I think we have a clear genius case.
The polemic, I think, appears to be due to two factors, because there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the direction to provoke them.
The evil offered to the principles of sport by these actions is not so ethical as ethical.
Official offers to capture No√´l Diners for BCN groups
The division of the calendar will concentrate this year a reserve scale for the 16 and 17 days.
There is a proliferation of self-financing funded by employees who wanted to expenditure between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tour and lottery, when December comes, the group foods are also returned before the No√´l, which continue to be the oxygen ballon for restaurants and divergence of Barcelona, but because of the crisis, they have moved in a criminal price to capture the majority client: almost everybody wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dining or paying, the people of business and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete compliance of the accountability, the calendar of this year (as the night of the Saint Sylvestre falls Vendredi) has focused on the requests in the week of 13 December, having been resulted as a result of a scanning of dinner reserves for the days of pi (17 and 17) and nearly the last week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companys who have removed collective dinings for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Everyone who is conjoncture, they ask all of the battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi of Restauration of Barcelona, Gaiet√† Farr√†s.
The representative of the patron is now not to prevent how the feasts will be this month.
"The people think so much before reserve."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he said.
The case will well be "for those who give good price quality and good service," adds, and remembers that the customers have the trend to descend with the crisis, so that the track around 25 euros has become majority in the request.
In a soundage in various centre institutions, requests for the night of 17 are constituted.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for this Friday, with the presence of paying less than 30 euros, which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjoncture, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another most powerful group, Andilana, with 16 institutions in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the Calendar has suggested more anticipated reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices of the past year, with menus for all costs of 19,95 to 30 euros," detailed.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Queque and a total of 23 locals, remain optimistic after detecting a fabric from the second semester and good, even though contingents, business perspectives for the No√´l.
The group sources indicate that 18 will also be a high-active day at the level of friends who celebrate the feasts.
At their six group menus, they added one for the neighbor, with 30 euros or more as a precious budget and the understanding that there is a proposal to depend a 10% more than the year past in order to require more detail, such as the Catalan wine produced according to the campaign method - 'cava'.
They also see the first improvement signs in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the Patron Fecasarm (including entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Divertisement of Barcelona), his Vice-President Enric Gom√†, trusts the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that the reserves are globally "animated", even if the clients "behaviour at the maximum".
This is true, the hope in the respect of the festivals has not been low, unless any payment is indicated.
The Pakistan Nuclear Programme generates a great concern for the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a faster ritme than any other country."
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the great concerns that providing to Washington the Pakistan Nuclear Programme.
In addition to the clear and safe details offering the content of talks and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries in the area of atomic security, instead of increase, "decrease" and that the indigenous Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster ritme than any other country of the world."
The particularity of the Pakistan Nuclear Programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy their attacks - is one of the main reasons for suffering in Washington.
It is also the embassor in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, inserted in a report before the visit of ancient National Security, James Jones: "The nearby of certain nuclear installations in the territory under Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials such as the short and vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The majority of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missions programmes is considered not only by the United States but also by Russia, as proliferant and a reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has been built by the personal with strict religious faiths to protect nuclear installations; the low-down of educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missional programmes," said the expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of External Republic during a meeting with his American homologues.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the more reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the area of nuclear proliferation and the highest rate of nuclear weapons.
A disaster of the Ammbassade in May, which means "fruitful" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "The transparency is often inexistent; the aid offers remain without answer or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, officer of the National Intelligence for South Asia, states that "before the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster ritme than any other country of the world."
The Embassy Patterson also requests Washington, during a visit of the head of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, that he makes it to understand "three clearly" responsible for that "The Army of Pakistan must end with the tacite support for terrorist groups."
At the captain of Wikileaks
Obama will have a high responsible responsibility for anti-terroristic fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol builds a red warning to follow moves and locate in Assange.
All aspects linked to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emerged a "round warning" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assage.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement.
In addition, this isn't new, but it's date of 20 November.
And this is nothing to do with the last filtering of more than four million diplomatic documents in the United States but with sexual abuse that Australia is against Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
In 20, the International Police Body with the Sitz in Lyon (France) sent the order to request Sweden, but he didn't make it public until yesterday after having received the authorisation of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to get its provisional arrest and extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give the order of a person who has a red warning, many of the Member States, according to the statements of the organization, consist of the network, notes a free path for the arrestation - that the national body of the police must realize - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Switzerland and English, where it is thinking that Assange is found.
The movement pointed to Assange's lawyers, which yesterday published a letter from the fact that Wikileaks funder of 39 years was made available to answer the questions of the Sweden authorities.
They also remind that Assange was concerned and received the permission to go out of Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, that it is compared to the celebration of Lavrentiy Pablovich Beria, the chief of Stalin security.
"It seems to be a chase, not a legal persecution," declared the mission.
While the world looks for him - and his mother in Australia defends his son's unbelieving -- Asange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't touch.
The lunch he gave a non-determined location to the director of the Time review through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the demission of the Secretary-General of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to show that she was responsible to give orders to the American diplomas that they are in the United Nations by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, she should demission."
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the Secretary of Press of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "risic and absurde" the request of demission.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said to the CNN.
Obama himself carried a high responsible responsibility for the anti-terroristic fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new fucking documents.
The trial of the port speaker of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assing contrast with the opinions that the political and conservators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressist who since January will preside the National Security Committee in the Basse Chamber requested the State Department to study the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations " to ensure its funds and to continue everyone who provides them contributions or assistance."
Too far, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper's advisor, who has returned on his statements after he said that Assange should be killed.
"Obama should transform it in a target and use a air without equipment or something similar."
A person who didn't ask for excuses was Mike Huckabee, Minister of Baptist, ex-governant of Arkansas and possible candidate to the President.
"He who is in the Government who has filtered information is guilty of trahison and all that is not execution would be a very favorable punishment," said to Fox.
Poigcercos are looking for peace in ERC with eye clinics to Carod adeptes
The Republican Leader will enable a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc√≥s seems to have found the receipt to resolve the second internal revolution within the ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of votes.
The President of the Partie is aware that his demission threat is not sufficient for the adoptions of the elder leader Josep Llu√≠s Carod-Ruvira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also delayed as his liar, and that it can not absolutely give him heads that he had with other curtains.
That is why the Leader of Left will try to win his new critics with eye clinics that allow him to blind up until municipal elections.
For the beginning, Puigcerc√≥s announced yesterday than over 200 national ERC advisers may be spoken on its secretly continued.
With vote bulletins, not on the hand.
If the carodists want to carry a certain vote of penalisation to the President, they can do it without fear to the represailles.
In fact, the leader of rangs wants to lose the image of division and the offering to his person.
In several interviews, he said that he would not consider ratified with half more than one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result to Bulgarian would not be well.
The nearby people in Carod requires the President a little more than put his position to the military position, a guest that does not need when Puigcerc√≥s controls the most organisation between the congress.
But because they do not have enough majority to strengthen demissions, they will try to achieve with the executive a road sheet until May.
In this regard, they hoped to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcerc√≥s in switching the promise of this to programme the congress for the age of 2011, which the leaders consider as a safe fact.
The ERC leader announced that the "polyphone" affects stability and that its objective is to make it one time for all organizations can be able to lay his room in family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Joseph Huguet signed in his symptomatic blog.
Considering the Ideologist of Puigcerc√≥s, the Innovation Officer thought that the leader would be ratified "with a variety of objectives" is like it was done.
And he numbered the five, which he sublines two.
The first, "recomposition" is the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, including new figures from Carod's adoption sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC is sold once for the whole assembly as functioning mechanism.
He therefore defends a reform of statutes that allows the implementation of the congress through the elections of the delegated.
Finding with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercos team, which has already stopped in this sense in the last two congress.
In fact, the conclave convulsion of 2008 was able to review the Model of Assembly in a specific congress of State Reform.
This meeting remains inappropriate because the internal marriage of the past years was not recommended to address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors in the case, the moment may be good to take and shut it forever.

China maintains the objectives to reduce the gas effect of serious gas
The representative of this country in the COP16 ensures that its country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon trace and detailed that it holds its offer to reduce until 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 per cent of its gas emissions in real gas steel before 2020, confirmed Su Wei, representative of this country to the COP16.
In its first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensures that its country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon trace and restore its industry.
In fact, the last four years, his country invested 245 million dollars in the efforts to reduce the gas emissment in real gas.
However, he stated clearly that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese strategy in the area of climate change is divided in four areas: dialogue; capacity construction; construction of institutions and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, including the approval, the past year, of a new Energy Law, which recognizes the objectives of the reduction of gass in real gas reduction, has explained.
On the other hand, he underlined that in China, the federal authorities have coordinated with governments and locals to achieve energy equipment objectives, effective energy use and reduction of emissions.
Furthermore, there are various multiannual plans currently or completed, as financed by the Chinese Government, as well as by governments of other countries.
For example, the efficient Energy Utilization Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the private initiative.

Spanish legal expulsion: Cesar Nava
The national manager of PAN detailed that the old panist leader had the right to address the Commission of the National Order to proclaim what is right.
The National Leader of PAN, Cesar Nava Vazquez ensures that the expression of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the old leader of panist has the right to address the Commission of National Order to declare what is right.
In the previous interview of Gabino Cu√® Monteagudo's Protector, he said that in any case, Spain's expulsion is a decision adopted at local level.
"It is a self-named decision of the Commission of Order of Sonra."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, the event, in order to make a call to the Commission of the National Council's Order, so that it is a decision taken in the context of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he explained that it is not the time to think in 2012, and there has never been an agreement for the presidential candidate on the negotiation table.
Nava Vazquez was stated convinced that the National Action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where it should be chosen a successor.
"This (a cohesion in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the treaty table, at least for the time, has been a approach for local elections that have been successful and has achieved its objective."
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported for 71 years of dialogue, because "the internal competition does not fear us; in contrast, "we will save it and make it stronger," he said.
He said that no doubt the advice will elect the best leader/e which National Action needs for the following three years, so he would give the replacement "to the person determined by the Council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be glad to leave the President's office of the party at any of the five."
He proposed that the relationship recorded by the parties to the elections of 4 July will be considered at the next discussion, even if "not yet the time to think in 2012."
"For the time it is to join the Governor Gabino Cu√© in this task."
In this framework, he underlined that the three governments who exceed cohesions in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the travel and will be a reason for observing in all the country, so that it has been made "a lot of hope in what they concern, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of the expectations."
When the PRI critics were asked against President Felipe Calderon because of his discussions during his four years of government, Cesar Nava asked the prizes to think about the six years of the elder President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salines of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas have been better than the Fox and Calderon; that they start to defend them; that they're out of armor," he said.
He stated that the Federal Executive Officer may make expressions as he made in his talks in the National Auditor, because there is no building in the country and less than the censure.
Obama promised in Twitter the law for students without papers
"If you are agreed with the approval of the Law Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to apply this legislation," said the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has been joined today to national mobilization to support the Law Dream Act, to legitimate students without papers, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you are agreed with the approval of the Law Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approval this legislation," said Twitte Obama.
His short message maintains a cybernetic link with a larger document that requests the public to contact the senators immediately, because the vote to the legislation is imminent.
"I have a vote that we hope soon, now it's the time to listen to your voice," he signed.
The message was declared after the 42 Republic senators had been amended to lock the vote of all legislation if the extension of the reductions of Bush's time and the government's financing continues.
An such block, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republic Senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned on the Republican Blocage of the Law Dream Act and other projects, the president Robert Gibbs said that it is confident that once the fiscal problem is resolved, we can establish an assessment for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time."
"We all agree that we need to resolve this fiscal problem before the end of the year."
"I think we can get a agreement at a moment given in this sense and then we can plan the rest sequence," he said.
The leader of the Democratic Democracy of the Senat, Harry Reid, announced March that he would ask a "debatting vote" for the Law Dream Act, which is why the initiative for legalizing students without papers could be voted from the next Jeudi in the Senat, even if the most likely would be the next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Republic Law would be legalized by 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before 16 years, they remained in this country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or Army.
However, the Partisans need 60 votes to approve the initiative, because they need the concourse of many republicans, in the moments where the Partisan organizations of the Protagonist project are a intense lobbying to ensure that the law is approved.
Democrates, most of them support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only a republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the Partisans of the Dream Act require the vote of several republians if other democracies are decisive to vote against the initiative.
In the most recent republicans, there are major senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the senator who went out of George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed the mandate of his Senator Meltinez.
Other republicans who have supported the past Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they would not support it in another occasion.
Another republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture until now.
Even if the Representative Chamber has a different version, analyts agree with the fact that the largest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senat.
With the literature on the dog on the ground
The second step of the Plaisers in the language was a promenade in which participants have made a statement
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the dog on the ground? what hopes for me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second step of the Players of the language, a cycle who glorifys the literature in Spanish and who this time used the subtitle of his question (but another round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained).
The dog on the board"... we put in the embarras," started the argentin writer in public, most of the young people, who were gathered together at the International Forre of Guadalajara Library (FIL) to listen to this modeled table by Marisol Shulz and to which they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montro and Luis Garcia Montro.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who wants to know what the "play" is, she's going from a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same report.
From the infectionologist she comes convinced: "Paint is not my strength, it may be my pleasure."
At the end, after a fruitful approach with the traumatolog who cut the suffle in the middle of the collar, but who explains that pleasure is not a scientist term; it is the psychanalyst that reveals mystery: "The plague is what is open in reality, the symbol is the cicatric."
The protagonist supplyed and concluded: "I only knew that it is open in reality and that it doesn't exist," but convinces that the joys and the pieces of the language should be very connected among them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramirez also expressed a reviewing report that he instructed Eloge in the invention, where the dawn on the ground is not nominated but at a time it is discovered.
With magical realism touchs, he talked about a famous fame that touched clouds, made people who had gone away or repaired greenness that a damage had lost, a story that lived to speak then in America, the great news that had been from the beginning of his own cross and quoted to Bernal√≠az del Castillo, which criticizes the exceptions of the officers of conquering captains.
"Whoever has invented us all (writing) has been mocked false witnesses that appeared in the history present as real, but in a way we would never have mentioned the history of America with a imagination that even missed the poor."
Nevertheless, he underlined, "the fools and the lies have the best imagination" and here the reality converging with the lie, we don't know what part of the story is to a band or another, where the literature of fiction has achieved its support.
This is called the "Tradition of Cervantes".
"It's thanks to his heritage that we're what we say."
At its tour, the writer Mayra Montyero announced and approved the variety of interpretations proposed by the invitation of the FIL with its round table It must be on the ground.
The Portuguese Cubaine raised her on the great range of social violence through its country - and Latin America shared - produces the trafficking and drug sell.
"I think the good literature, the good poesia of the good songs refers to a tacite commitment that is not sure priority," she indicated, after saying that the reality of the literature is the communication and the size of the engagement that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chimical reaction" of this last.
The evening is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc√≠a Monter, who also sublined "it must be on the board of the writer."
He considered that in a world who lives in a great speed, also in the respect of intellectual habits and the control of the consciences that turns to the advance of dogmatisms, "the end of each statement there is a small not and behind each neglection there is a little yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be masters of reality, we must wear: and wearing is a lot of times to put the dawn on the ground and to decrease people who feel very comforted in thinking in caricature, white and black, in ideas established and without nudity, and also to the powers that prevent a white and black world," he invited to receive the sense of write.
Romano to the chase of his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the ends he had high and low in his carrier, but he had three times the series of decision.
With the part of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are more than two different styles that compare themselves, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the ends, he had high and low in his carrier, but he had three times the series of decisions, even though he has not put into the thousands and it is that this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended to consolidate with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the guests and curiously with the same team he played consecutive ends.
The holy strategy has arrived at its first end as a trainer in the Office of 2002, when he had the branches of Morelia with which he had lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; finally, in Clouture 2003 he also arrived with a decision and had lost again with the global result of 3-1 and it was exactly against Rayado.
With Santos Laguna already in the Bicentenary Tournoi 2010, Ruben suffered a reverse again, because his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he received a profit for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players have rated 11 meters, and he suffered the result of 4-3.
Ruben lost two ends with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival to the tour, so he doesn't want to have the same sort, he tried to decline the disease to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he believes that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the timon when it asked him what would be the low points in the ends.
It remembers a lot of the last end, which he assures that he has learned much, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the arbitr has finished the end, we can't feed, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to get us ready to run and I think it's a lesson, before the end of the match we can't make it."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, what doesn't worry about it, because he trusts his players: "We're never looking for the series of penalties, we're trying to finish in the regular period, but sometimes it's not only left us to prepare, the previous tour we've been prepared, unfortunately the destination has made us a bad turn, sometimes it's emotions or the desire to keep the title in our hands, he's appealed to us, that's how we served the end for this, and we were not going to do more in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to be a sub-champion technology and to enjoy the first time the glory offered by the titles.

NASA announces extraterrestre life discovery
The United States Spanish Agency quoted the pressure to present a discovery tomorrow that will have the impact on the research of lives in the space.
The National Administration of Aeronautic and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, judic, astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a conference tomorrow tomorrow pressing conference, at 13:00 at the seat of NASA in Washington for astrobiology experts, science who study the origin, evolution, distribution and future life in the Universal.
When she cited the pressure, the NASA ensures that she would have the impact on the investigation of external life," which has submitted specifications from the part of the experts of other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in hostile environments that they thought inhabitants and put the possibility to become smart as humans if their life conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microb discovered on the base of Mono Lake in the National Yosemite Parc, California, which lives in a environment that it was too rich for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In all forms, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of life and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our welcome atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologists, if these organisms use the arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know.
The Space Agency will communicate the real port of discovery in the press conference tomorrow, judic.
At the conference, Pamela Conrad will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studys the possibility of life on Mars; and the Biology Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest satellite of Saturne), under the perspective that its chemicals are similar to the earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and 'bloc' opposant
With Reforms to the Organization Act of the Congress, we are able to achieve bipartism, we denounce.
The 60th came to be installed when the Congress appeared a contrary block directed by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patr√≥n Montalvo, which was declared independently and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of Bipartism to the rooms.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th L√©gislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez, of Convergency; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tone' against the Reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they have repeated the bipartism because there are now two persons, of the same number of parties, which control the Congress.
These four deputys, at the cost of Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were only to vote against the Director President of Salvador L√≥pez Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that with these institutional reforms, the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He noted that the following days they would talk to representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme by a political will and if they don't have it, they will be reserved by both parties and so will end the opponent coalition.
"It's just happening here (opposing coalition), it's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political delegation of considering the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez, of Convergence, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr√≥n there are coincidences, and that's why they make a plural group.
We can't allow, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, or now "doupolistic".
"This is not the spirit of the law's reform that there is an eternal bipartism in the Congress."
In the beginning, this group begins with 5 legislators, and they are now talking to other colleagues to be more, has submitted the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congres has become a "butin" between two, having made a lie to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one part, now they divided it between two."
Patr√≥n Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place to negotiating tables.
"When they don't leave cupual agreements outside 5 which probably will be 9 deputy, now to the five that we see, separated in various fractions, we decided to join us to find a place in the negotiation table, that's the problem that they have done, which they decided, we are outside and we are not agreed with this reform."
$200 million more for "the provider"
Mairia of Mairia pays another cheque to the owner question of the electronic equipment.
Another cheque of about 200 miles of pesos was for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
With this, the cost that we paid this second semester to the owner of the electronic equipment is up to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, this last cheque number 9258447 was exhausted on the past 16 November for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of providers".
The Treasury Luis Miguel L√≥pez Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this provider, which was observed by the Supreme Auditor of the State to sell a higher price.
What we have not reported is the total of the debt and, therefore, the quantities of cheques will still be broken for Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we need to, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques have "reached" the last trimester of the year: on 24 September, two on October 15, 19 October, 29 October, and this last, on 16 November.
Even if the provider has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the law when a company is questioned by ASE, to avoid other governments to use its services, the Tresory ensures that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Northest, had published a review of the cheques that Mairia has issued to its providers, explaining that in March 2008 - July 2010, in Maier Jorge Abel L√≥pez S√°nchez, the Municipal to pay Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also carried transactions with Jumapam, buying more than 3 million pesos cheques.
Touristic sites must be broken
Turist businessers regulate the accident of the stranger tourist because of the bad conditions of S√°nchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After a strange tourist entered into a cross of S√°nchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to carry attention to the areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of the Tradeholders of Zona Dorada, mentioned that they had many times concerned that the image of the destination should be submitted and new activities should be replaced by others whose tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trillors has affected because tourists come to walk and see disturbing and disturbing near trades.
"The politicians don't know that it means to close a company a day and they don't know the strength that we lose, but they did not work for so long and without a appropriate planning."
The hotel Joseph Ramon Manguart S√°nchez said that the shock of the tourist has exposed the missing prevention and maintained the part of Mayria.
"The municipality should assume its responsibility and disappear that it happens again, so it has been through a preventive treatment and does not only the correction."
"We want to play a own town, because not only because of the fact that this is a tourist area, we have to maintain it, but as inhabitants who meet a own place to live there and Mayria needs to change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are negligent and unfulfilled, says, for example, Escudo and Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, since the tourist comes, it's not only depending on promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has property in its areas, bulevards, keeping permanent tourist attractions," said.
"We didn't offer them the attention that we need and that kind of facts subscribe something that is noting for all, the maintenance is necessary."
Ra√∫l Llera Mart√≠nez, under the secretary of Promotion Touristic, stated that the recovery of the tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not used correctly and projected a bad image.
He spoke about a series of locations that should be online with the municipality and be a priority to have the town updated, self-ordered, and that it is attractive because she has a tourist call.
"Blessed Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and locations that should be ordered first, cleaning and set online to make them attractives to add to the investment that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results in the Congress
Eduardo D√†valos, President of the CCE, proposed that the deputy had a great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of various causes that are compared to them.
Mazatlan's business sector is concerned with a lot of and free work of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsioned and confronted with great problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislation formed by seven political forces, 19 deputy of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the Partie, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergency and one of the PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new integrants of the Government Congress are a own and attached management with society and different sectors needing a responsible legal work and that the same models of party or parentalism do not repeat.
Eduardo D√†valos, President of the CCE, proposed that the deputy had a great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of various causes that are compared to them.
"We hope that the deputy will actually exercise their rights, free agreements between the parties because the coutm is that they make patterns to ensure their own interests, and they are transformed in the mass of carnaval of governments and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to ensure the commitment to establish the needed points that the current Government make progress.
"We will ensure that they do a good work and especially involved with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence vote in the past elections.
Joseph Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez, President of the Association of the Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the major provocations of 40 popular representatives is the to pull and add forces in searching for the economic growth of the State, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important is that they have the economic growth, that they generated stimulations for investment and infrastructure, and that will stimulate the generation of workshops."
In regard to tourist activities, he asked new legislators to give it the importance that she has in the Government budget to consolidate the Government Secretariat of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a more reduced budget, and it is incognised as an important and generic economic activity of views and investment and which is directly raised with agricultural industry."
In fact, it is necessary to classify resources to detonators projects that help the State be sure and update the Alcohol Law that previous legislations could not be resolved.
We're looking for a magic king
Pupped, cars and bicyclets, among other games, are the desire of children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings of Mages will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their family is formed by or less than 12 people and a hair.
However, Adeleida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalope, Isaiah, Joseph John and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthasar and Gaspard will bring them the games and clothes they want so much.
The family lives a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live on the day because their father has no stabil employment.
"Therefore it's very hard for us, because my wife has no job, but we're sold mandarins and patates... and the next day I'm going with the "plaves" to sell in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a pope or a bicyclet, and his sister Isabel, three years old, would like Barbie.
At his tour, Jos√© Alfredo, of 10 years, aspired for long time to have a "month truck" and for his little brother Jesus, of 8 months, Cayitana suggests a size clothing for a year.
"He said to me (Jose Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster,' but I said to him, 'We'll see, my son, 'cause he was very loving," remembered with the threat of Cayetan.
For the biggest children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, was locked on 12; Isaiah, of 10 years, was cut down the size of 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, was shut up the eight.
Jos√© Juan, 14 years old, needed a couple of sports, so a couple of five and half or six would help him much.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage by giving a game or money to the Northwest reception.
14 Presumed Drug Traffics arrested
A decade of surveys have been completed in Australia, mercredi, in the framework of the demainment of a production and sale of cannabis network.
Four people have been arrested and will face various accusations.
Researchs were discovered in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations that would serve for drug production.
"How about 750 cancer plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment have been inserted," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, port-word of the Quebec Sucre.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two heads of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should be compared to the Sherbrooke Justice Palace in the hours following their arrest.
They could face cannabis production accusations, possession in order to make the training, complot and service fly, among others.
These investigations have been followed by a long halein investigation, which has performed nearly a year.

Clandestin migration can continue without problem
The project of conservators who, according to the Government, should fix the problem of Clandestian migrants migrants, will be struck at all, while the three opposition parties have made the mercredian that they could not support it.
"I'm strongly supported on the Chart."
"I'm standing with a part that created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was turned to deputy after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals suggest that the law project as proposed, which would allow any person from a ship identified as transporting Clandestian immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Liberties.
The chief of the Chebecois Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the law project, because he takes it to the bad target.
"We are against and it seems that all the parties of the opposition are against, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr Duceppe.
The NPD criticism for immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the critics that wanted to be not enough close to the Clandestian Immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree to take measures against Clandestin passors and this is what we do by the intermitting of another law project, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We don't support the law of conservators because he takes them to refugees and serves children for at least one year," said Mrs. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenny, accused the opposition parts of playing the policy and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians massively tell the deputys that they did not remove this kind of Clandestin migration, these criminal operations that are destined to the Canadian and treated the country as a pallison."
"There are expected that Canada takes firm measures," the Ministry Kenny replied.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its law project, which could bring the country to elections that would reject it.
However, a conservator said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask a vote for each deputy who would be oppressed then before his electorers.
The new unit does not make unianimity
Despite the possibility of creating a permanent unit to fight corruption and counsel by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the creation of a public research committee on the subject.
The Ministry of the Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea doesn't be given yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue since last January.
Metropol has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, March's announce was surprised more than one.
It is necessary to say that on a permanent meeting of the Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October last, this measure has never been discussed without the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was no more need for the public security crisis, Stephane Bergeron, who qualified this announcement of "lapin out of a chapter" and "bringed solution on the border of a table".
The Ministry Dutil replied to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the future unit.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, it's happy to confirm."
"We're aware of that problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the implementation of a public research.
"Plus Mr. Charest is obvious to do not want to create this investigation committee, but more people think like you and I have something to hide," explains he.
"The only way to have a research committee is the demission of John Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, the teacher of Ethics and Government at the National Public Administration School.
In order to go out of this impasse, he suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the general checker to investigate counsel and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general checker," he claims.
He also likes that Quebec could give the checker the same powers and the Commissioner, allowing him to provide people to witness.
The creation of a permanent audience is not the only project in the Charest Government's cartons.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to modify the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be exhausted by the President of Marteau's operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is presently concerned about some amendments related to this document.
In the operation of Printemps 2001, who was struggled by the motard groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the Law on the gangsterism.
River under high monitoring
Many water courses remain under high surveillance because of strong precipities that have been attacked on several regions of the provinces since March.
A terrain sliding occurred after midnight, in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
On the evening, another sliding would be produced in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi√®re.
A road has gone.
From March to March evening, strong precipitations were attacked on several regions, or from 40 to 70 miles of rain.
From 20 to 40 miles of additional rain were expected from here on the night, according to the regions.
The sectors at the north of the river and in the Valley of the southern were the most touched.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain totally.
As we need to add these precipities to the source of snow already accumulated in certain sectors, it is afraid of the delay of several water courses.
Warnings of inundation warnings have been issued by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Oareau River and Achigan, in Lanaudi√®re.
The Rivers of North, Saint-Jerome, Laurentides, and Chen, in Lotbini√®re, were doing about the object of inundation veil and stayed under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudi√®re, the strong precipitatives have introduced the delay of certain lakes, Saint-Julien, Saint-Marcelline-de-Kildare, and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary point was imported because of strong rains.
Ten residences have been evacuated by preventive measure.
In August, the degradation of certain lakes has entered the closement of several paths, including in Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
Civil Security stays on a feet of warning and monitors the situation of the nearby, indicated Annik Bouchard, Security Council.
The Quebec's Prevision Centre has for its part mercredied warnings for several rivers, including Maskinonge, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly blameful dump
The Quebec St√©phane Dupon radio animator has submitted a partly reverse before the Canadian Council of the Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for discussions on social assistance and the Haitians as well as on its larger language in waters.
The CCNR judges that Mr. Dupon and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some proposals contained "the inexact information on social assistance, the negative representatives of the Haiti and the Great language which do not correspond to the broken emissions during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion on the suicide, including the difference of the name of two persons who were suicided, did not violate the radiodiffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several statements on comments made during emissions distributed between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a plain of the Common Front of the Social Assistance Persons in Quebec.
The group was pleased that the entire quantities in the emission were unexactly infected.
Animators must present solid information instead of trombers.
With regard to the suicide, the admonitor Stephane Du Pont estimated that the suicide was a lack.
Most of the Committee members concluded that the vehicle message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee consists that the episodes made by "Dupont the Middle" have addressed a delicate subject in equitable and appropriate way."
So there was no blame to be held on his place.
The last ligue led on statements that followed the earth's trembling in Haiti.
Stephane Dupon and Jean-Ren√© Dufort were then delivered to a medical face that had suffered many reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he did no gift to help the Haitis because we could not know with sure that the needful people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their sumulative effect was a negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned my suspension over there three days."
"My dossier is born a year and half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee declares the distribution of large languages.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radiodiffuser collaborated "forward his obligation."
The consequences are minimized for the station that, among others, should preach these decisions once during the great hearing hours in a period of three days.
A King of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Monterealais Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely particular park.
The athlete that exceeds in "sanda" (kung-fu "fulful contact"), in kickboxing and in Thai's boxes up on the fathers and the rings of the world in searching for new deficits.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing for 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal, was installed in the metropol since 2008 to develop in professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights somewhere, because for those who don't love the game at the ground in mixed martial arts, the competitions are weird in North America."
Recently, who works on security agents and as commissions for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to its rivers, bringing two gold medicines to the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburg, in Scotland.
"I reported the kickboxing categories of full contact and boxes of Thai, he explained."
"Today, I'm ready to go to China for the Coup of the Sand world."
"The fighters who have finished among the four first when the last campaign of the world in each category were invited."
"I've brought the bronze in 2009 to Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I've finished the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tour to the fifth range, while I arrived the third to Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting is that I have progressed every competition."
"To this ritme, I'll be first this time or the next year!"
The "shou" or "sanda" is a originary discipline from China where the poing and foot shoes are authorised, as well as the projections on the ground.
The parts are originally developed on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renamed pugilista issu of this form of battle is the Viet-Viet-American origin Cung Le, well recognised in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his carrier, he will certainly answer his presence to the super tournoi "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and the most prestigious in China, has explained the gaillard sympathy."
"It's a little bit the equality of the Lumpinee State (the largest stage of Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal brought his first battle, in half-end of his category (80 kg), before he lost.
"He who ran me was a real pro, he's analyzed."
"There are four fighters by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The guaranteers of the half-ends are in the end of their category."
"Therefore, every category's winners are faced to cooling a single campion, the King of the bug-fu."
450 million contracts without offer calls
Hydro-Quebec granted 450 million dollars in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this broadcast of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has obtained the most important, the manner of the project, for a total of $295 million without offering.
This consortium called Energy Gerance was established in 2004 in concomiting the choice of Hydro-Quebec to trust private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium Energy Gerance declared the contract's lucrative without a call of public offers.
For the Chebekois Party, the review of business consortiums has a serious ethical problem that is risking to eliminate competition and to prevent prices.
"This is the new way to make counsel and avoid competition."
"It means that people, instead of doing this secretly, now makes it openly," said the deputy Sylvain Simard in press conference yesterday.
Moreover in the morning, Mr. Simard took the question to the National Assembly because he said difficultly to see how public interest can be served in this way.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied on the midnight, with a courageously that there was a collision for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she suffered, supporting that the PQ was "false" and had "manched of rigour."
She said, "It would be the moon of things" that the PQ would forgive.
The form of consortiums is a current practice in the whole world.
It is usually a limited cohesion in the time that allows two or more enterprises to regroup their respective experts to respond to an offer call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project consists of a high level of complexity with the broadcast of work.
The chantinger is currently running and has to escape until 2012.
However, the contract has been assigned without acting competition game; there has been negotiations.
Therefore, the formula of consortiums is no more exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As it declared last week The Devoir, the form of consortiums in the genie-consistence sector makes the object of a government research.
A quick survey of Quebec's registry allows more than 200 consortiums, which some seem permanent.
So the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, return to one and even moral person, or Dessau.
For the consortium of Energy Guerance, the Ministry Normandeau submitted that "the territory of the Baie James's territory replies to special manual works and that Hydro-Quebec is particularly responsible since the 70s."
The great Leader of the Eastmain Project, Real Laporte, of the Baie James's Energy Society (SEBJ), has given a statement that has made surprise the fact that the draft management contract has been granted to gravity.
"If you're going to call offers and there's a little ministerial, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices, or you take the people that are in this market and you say, we're going to negotiate a satisfactory understanding and a good price."
"But the idea, it's not the price that is important, it's the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract granted to the Consortium Energy Gerance is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50 000 dollars received by the Chebec Partie.
The contracts have been concluded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, the Deputy has compiled 109 contracts of genie-consolidation agreements agreed between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their officers, including solitary laboratorys.
SNC-Lavalin reviewed 22 contracts, Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting its participation in Energy Guerance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They totalize 449 783 344 dollars, including the energy guarantee of 295 131 564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has noticed that the four firms that compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor) are "known in the Liberal Partie of Quebec".
The Ministry Normandeau left that the PQ is also linked to those "financial" firms before determined that it was in place of its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "verte" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but scepticly.
The consumer whobecois is very untrusted in the actors of sustainable development, but also the equitable marks and the environmental certifications to guide his choice.
Pis, even if he is bathed in a median universe where the messages for a more responsible consumption, he deploys a failure of creditable information, even to qualify his commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, which the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the consumption of products that are socially responsible in 2010, the Quebecs seem to grant a lot of credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say not to believe the environmental enhancement of enterprises, as well as the green publicity of companies, shows the tool of measures developed by the Observatory of consumption responsible for Sherbrooke University.
Otherwise: the half of consumers doubts the integrity of official certifications on equitable products, but also the creditability of products and marks appear as eco-responsible, indicates Barometer.
In the same vine, the discussion of the politicians on this subject is to be serious only 14,6% of the Quebec.
However, the information on consumption on the responsibility seems primarily to stimulate this bread of the currently annuous consumption by the third of the Chebec consumers.
In fact, the empty and the low character of the information would calm 46% of consumers.
This is the second row identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, one third of the Quebec is also disappointed by the performance of green products or services that we are looking for them to put them into the hands.
On another note, consumers have been nearly half 2010 changed their habit and, especially, changed by one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At the height of 61%, they also favored accompanies to the commercials of their quarter and privileged the acquisition of food products in their region, indicating the Barometer.
Green and responsible - the index of the consumption was 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the consumption man of Quebec likes to be presented as the king of the recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental impression in concern of the protection of animals.
However, his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, indicating the Barometer: in 2010, 28% of the Quebecs have indicated that they have used the common transport or have recognised the cooling to defend their green interests.
The market and ice was also supported by 39,1% of the participants to this large manufacturer investigation, which came to take its first click.
A State preparation for eXcentris rating
The Government of Quebec, which was requested to be financed in the rate of the eXcentris complexion of the company of Angus and the Parallele, accepted to cooperate, but to concurrence of a price only.
The Development Society of Angus and the Parallelel, who hoped a gift of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Culture to reach to Daniel Langlois the cynematographic complex eXcentris on the St. Laurent Boulevard, when he returned his full cinephilical vocation, does not get what they were calling.
The Government agrees to apply in the folder, but to its own conditions.
Instead of waiting, the Government of Quebec proposes a price which the amount would be lower than the initial accommodation, which could be a viable solution in advanced conditions, at least the opinion of the issues of the State offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12,8 million was already rejected by Quebec the last printemps, but the requests have been revealed since.
A proposal and a plan of action was sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), France Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris document.
He made him a last report for a decade of days ago.
But the contra-proposal of the campaign has come to March SODEC.
Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to answer it.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the donation of the State must really be discharged.
Remember that the Association of Cinemas and Cineparks of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the eXcentris rate, as the Ministry of Culture is not to finance immobilier projects, which has not done for other cinema salts.
However, several environmental intervenants claimed to be a sustainable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the Master of Ceans, has been ten years in his arms the author's cinema in his complex locations after he had financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation of the Tresor Council.
The missing salt for independent films is crying in Montreal, and eXcentris had his trust in his client.
The Angus and the Parallelele society, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilots, on their side, a private financing campaign, hoped to collect 7000,000 dollars to put on the road of the acquisition.
Since 2009, one of the three screens, The Parallele, continues to spread eXcentris films.
The goal of the future accusers is to open the three salts on February 27, projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois of men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remind the Devoir and we ignore what he and his group think of proposals to the bottom that they have been done.
The floor up on a complex Canadian...
The new American diplomatic chambers developed by WikiLeaks lift up the street on what the United States consider as the complex of minority of Canadians against the Americans, but the same way they take the feeling of higherness of these lasts against Canada.
Thus, American diplomates are surprised that each Canadian electoral had no canadian relations with the spirit to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, established on the public place yesterday, provide more crowling details than the substance content to be under the dent.
A chamber dated on 22 September 2008, or in full federal electoral campaign, refers to what point the United States do not be part of the political leaders.
In a great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
"A complex of nearly inherited Canadian minority may be the Canadian political leaders to speak about the internal interests of the day instead of bringing this choice on the United States (as in the campaign on the free-change of 1988)," wrote he.
The United States, therefore, concluded, "the proverbial elephant of this election: all of them, but potentially too threatened to speak."
The ambassador includes at least this "surveying silence" that both countries have a intense political and economic relationship.
"It is, of course, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and more than one of the parties to managing this essential relationship should be a key factor that electors have to vote."
The other expression of this importance feels leaving in the room on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, carried in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama to his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the overliving of the Government when the trust vote begins in February on the Federal Budget, which Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade because of a review plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars," wrote Mr. Breese.
No part has been mentioned that the Government had to prophesy the Parliament before No√´l to refuse to be converted by the coalition and that the opposition parties had made its conditional survival to the quality of the proposed relationship plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008, and signed by the Wilkins Ambassador, prevents Washington of the more negative image than the dramatic series in CBC are from the United States.
The campaign is concerned about Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which we observe little subtile references in Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or yet for the CIA mutual questions.
Another cabin reports that Hillary Clinton asked his French homologic Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to buy some prisoners in Guant√°namo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "cas per case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He sent a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary has accepted to see the folder again."
Let us note that the spirits escape about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an ancient advice of Stephen Harper, stated about the CBC forests that the responsible for this massive escape should be "assert."
He made Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A world plan to renew the lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday a renew plan for household, trade and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to get a gas reduction of serious gas (GES), which is at least the third of the additional reduction that needs to realize to establish the planetary climate here 2020.
This environmental plan is located in the creation of the major projects that the United Nations hopes to take into Canc√∫n to compensate the absence of the restrictive reduction of industry countries.
According to the last plan, if the incandescent ampoules that are still monopolated from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the essential of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the GES on the planet to clarify the humans would be evident.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary park.
In Copenhague, the last year, large emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have been involving voluntary reduction plans that should be carried out the global 53 GT emissions of the EES to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to submit this balance further 5 Gt to stabilize the climate up to 2 centuries to avoid that it would not be out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy is disease in the form of chaleure and the rest, or 5% of the light.
With fluocompact ampoules, the energy expenditure is reduced from 75% and with new DEL-ampoules, it is reduced to the need of energy twice.
The fluo-compact ampoules are middle of 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new amplitudes in DEL, such as those who launched the manufacturer Philips this week - this society has also participated in the United Nations study - have a hope of life of 25,000 hours and consumption of 80% less than an incandescent ampole, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan to apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with reestates in more than a very little smoking.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Many specialists have shown reserves in the place of fluocompacts because they contain the market and that it is necessary to eliminate them as dangerous decades, which is not always possible in developing countries, except if manufacturers place consigns.
However, the report indicates that the main source of market emission on the planet is not the fluo-compact ampole, but the thermical centres in the carbon, which make a lot of market to produce electricity gathered in incoming ampoules.
Only in the United States, these centres have $25,000 tons of market per year.
The report details the benefits that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would earn a billion of dollars per year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, or the equivalence of 3.5 therms which the construction would cost 2.5 billion.
The Court of Ivoire expects the announcement of the electoral results in the nervousness
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, announced the publication of the results of the presidential election in C√¥te d'Ivoire after the expiration of the fixed periods.
"The Secretary-General subscribes the need for the independent electoral committee to fulfil its work and to announce the provisional results without a longer time, has sublined a port-word of the leader of the United Nations."
"He requests all Ivoirian parties and institutions to prove responsibility and to abstain any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Although the pressures exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral committee allowed to pass the middle date of mercredit without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday scrutin.
Nearly 40 minutes before the expiration of the period, the President of the CEI had reported the television that the Commission "continued to work" to preach the results.
The calls were multiplyed in the world so that the CEI finally proclaimed the name of the winter of the second tour between Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo campaign reported on annulation by the Constitutional Council of "frauduleux" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the state of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Chairman of the President Ivoirian, stated that the mandates of the electoral intimidation of the FN in the north of the country had disappeared the president's parties to vote.
All election may be cancelled if Gbagbo's statements are held by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's adversaries believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is guided by Paul Yao N'Dr√©, a nearly political license of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who decline all linked with the ex-rebelles, judged "inceptable" the retard in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he didn't go to revenge the victory.
His committees claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he has been declared to the constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral committee to discharge the results, it would be illegal.
The second tour of the Presidency, Sunday, was agreed to coordinate the meeting and reconciliation process of a country remained in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivoire political class that it may be responsible for events of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished on the head of the first tour on 31 October, with 38% of voices against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received the public support of the elder president Henri Konan Bedi√© (25% on the first tour).
The tax rate remains stabil in France at the third trimester
The rate of employment in France in the meaning of the International Working Office (BIT) remained at 9.3% in metropol (9.7% in counting the outer-mer departments), showing the corrected data of the proceedings of saisonary variations (CVS), which were published by the Insee.
The number of coopers is attached to 2.631 million in metropole.
The data of the second trimester were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in metropol and 9.7% with the DOMs.
On a year, the rate of rate is shown in higher than 0.1 point.
Moreover, 3,4 million people in the Metropolitan France did not work at the third trimester but would like to work, or not available in two weeks to work and to search or not a job.
The situation of young people on the work market has yet been degraded, with a new higher of the rate of steel, carried to 24,2% in metropol (+,0,9 points on three months, +0,5 points per year) and 25% including the DOMs.
At the third trimester, 637,000 young people from 15 to 24 years were in the sense of the BIT.
The elders have known for their part a lower higher steel, to 6,4% in metropol (+0,2 points per three months and on a year), 482 000 people of 50 or more, and 6,6% with the DOMs.
Only 25 to 49 years have benefited from a stability of the trimestre, to 8.3% in metropol (-0.1 points on three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insee has no longer published a monthly rate from 2006 after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the Statistics Agency of the European Union, continued to do it and announced 9,8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9,9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini was raised in examination and in detention
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, leader of deadline treatment and brother of the President of the General Bouches-du-Rhone Advisory Bouches-Rhone, has been examined and entered into Luynes' arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence in the framework of an investigation on fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for abus of social goods, funding and public goods, recalculation, active corruption, infringement and detention of municipalities, indicates his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is fighting and trying to explain about all the questions that the governor will put to him, and not fantasies."
"It's easy to continue for a lot of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them," said the AFP his lawyer, Florence Rault, before the audience of his client.
Mr. Guerini, the strong man brother of the PS in the department, Jean-No√´l Guerini, held by his lawyers to go to the judge before his audience a note to explain.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been raised in mercredian and grooming.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything else than to work on the discharge he had to handle.
With regard to the attribution of markets or to the destination of funds linked to their functioning, he never knew it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, ex-director of the Afghanistan Agricultural Services, was held in mercredial examination for declining public and compliance funds, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the document.
"My customer has given you explains to the facts that are invited to him."
"The teacher has not taken care of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and delivered freely in March evening in March, with a place under judicial control for two of them, indicated the adjoint prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karaabadjakian, Director-General in the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued for "influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier are considered one for the "saustration and destruction of public goods by a person carried out of a public service mission", the other for "compliance of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, has been examined for the "abus of social goods".
Between those who have been confronted to Mr. Guerini figure Stephane Brunengo-Girard, recently developed in a parallel case of fraud public markets touching the Corse.
Researchers suffer their companys to white the money of the great banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several open judicial information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for frauds in the transition of public markets, particularly in the field of disasters.
From the next source of the investigation, researchs focus on the conditions of attribution and functioning of a delay of the Ciotat, which collects the abcidents of Aubagne and some cities of Marseille (MPM).
Affair Clotilde Reiss: Elis√©e exaggered the meditation of Syria
In over 10 months of July 2009 to May 2010, the sort of Clotilde Reiss, the young French research arr√™ted in Iran for "spionnage", helicoptered in Haleine in France, mixed the diplomacy in a warning, and focused on the deterioration of the relations between Paris and the Teheran.
All under the attention of the United States diplomates.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveals some under this crisis.
They describe how Elis√©e explained his strategie to the Americans, going to give them advice for the treatment of their own "toges" crises in Iran (a small group of randoms).
They have shown how the French responsibles have searched to convince Washington that the freedom of the young France had not been in contrast the freedom of Majid Kakavand, a Iran who was held in France and searched by the American justice for material trafic for the benefit of the Iranian Nuclear Programme.
Finally, they put under a cruel light as the French president sought to manipulate media to believe the idea that the Sirian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the Liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on the way to manage cases."
The advice of Elis√©e for Strategy Affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, related to the American diplomat Kathleen Allgrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so to resort their own residents of force in Iran.
"What's the dream," they say, "not stop" in the media the words "based man's rights", "inocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to cut off the Irish regime, sensible to his image.
"Do it more than the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, when the discussions tried by discreet channels, "the silence will not rule anything," the Iranians are "masters in dilatory hands."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrestation of strangers is "a family tactic: the tacting of tactics for the political challenge."
It announces that the liberation of Clotilde Reiss' prison (which will interfere on 16 August, on the day when she refugees to France's embassy) "Iranians will require a large sum of money" (230 000 euros of caution).
And he makes know that Elisha's ancient of other cryses of eggs, a phenomenon that's going to grave.
The Iranians could "in the near future stop one of some 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has gone out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is distributed: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the United States expressed the exchange for an illegal electronic trafic sensible to Iran, is released freely in Paris on a judge decision.
The American embassy, as many observators, is asked about this amazing coincidency.
For Washington, which travels the Iranian Clandestin networks of acquisition of materials destined to the nuclear programme, the extension of Majid Khakavand is a bad new.
Did France accept a market?
Is Iran's liberation against the French?
In a new treatment with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Francois Richier ensures that it's not the case.
Elisea said, "It was not only "in surprise by the judge's decision," but he tried to oppose it.
"There has live changes between the French President and the guard of the squeals" (for the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judiciary decision, observe it.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "etroite" monitoring of French information services.
The advice of Elisea is a phone number, raccroch, then reports the American diplomat that Iran is currently located in buildings in Paris supported by the Iranian campaign.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elis√©e does not meet its efforts, through communications and "fuits" organised in the media, to believe that the Sirian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activities not without iron, and believe that the manipulation brings its fruit because several press articles reflect the French official version.
A telegram dated from 25 August 2009 calls "the mediate" of the French offices."
On what it bases so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Asad, the embassy in Paris is requested.
"If their full declarations of loyalty, the French officials recognize privately that they have only a vague notice of what the Syrians really have done."
The document then takes care of the reasons that Elisha had put into this fiction.
Communication efforts "see to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria", analyzes it.
A launched policy in 2008, which was then persuaded by many critical voices in France and foreign, as premature and immortalized.
"Exagering the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate the Syrian whose loyalty she can be attracted by playing a constructive role in the region."
The objective is also to "come grain of discourage between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows you of a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier trusted him, "It's sure we don't know if the Syrians did what it is."
"But we thanked them even though."
"This should at least seem confusion in the Irish."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her to Elisea.
In a communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role for the freedom of our compatriote".
No online games for young Koreans last month
The South Korean Government will adopt a law "de Cendrillon" which will interfere to the boys to play online games after a minute after blowing their access, have indicated government responsibilities.
A law project will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online games to block access to these games after week, younger than 16 years, have indicated representatives of cultural and family ministers.
"A lot of children play these games all night and then have difficulties to study at school and have a normal life during the day."
"We assess that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said the AFP Jo Rin, the Ministerial responsible for the Law Project.
Online games will be re-accessible at 6 hours of the morning.
The society will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law.
The Government also requests the companies to restrict the period of access to these games for young people whose parents are requesting it, added the responsibility.
He will also set up people who will call free software to limit the past time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most connected countries and the journals are regularly reported about different facts related to an intense use of Internet.
The country is also the incosented campaign of global online games.
In November, South Korea brought four gold media to the World Cyber Games, face to 58 other nations.
Mondiale 2018-2022: Fifa designs organizators countries
The Fifa Executive Committee describes the organisations of the world's Coupes in 2018 and 2022, a political choice in which influence and lobbying are risked to take the step on the technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the editing of the Queen of the Fifa will be located in Europe, traditional bastion of the disciple (4 candidates: English, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Belgium).
The 2022 will be more exotic, the International Federation hoped to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implantation in the United States or in the Extr√™ma-Est (Japanese, South Korea).
The list of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jos√© Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jos√© Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Netherlands Government Leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of economic and political improvements of a worldwide.
So cool treatment risks to suffer until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a herarchie between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, English, Portuguese documents (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very serious for the 22 members of the Executive Committee during the vote.
The Sunday Times, on the origin of the reveals that have obtained the suspension for corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Themarii and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the chances of his country, the football berg that has not obtained the Mondial only one time in 1966.
The BBC has sent a bed, lunch, distributing a documentary that spends three influenced members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
From what the Fifa disturbs and put the English responsibilities in the embarrass, which were launched in a intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron on the first line.
The ruler of the Government hopes to review the covenant successful by his President Tony Blair, which had received in 2005 for London the JO-2012 organization.
Will this intense activities be enough to sleep in England with the CE?
Nothing is less sure because the two Spain-Portugal does not miss atoms with its cities already prepared, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its culture foot.
But the economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could do their ambitions.
Representatives against the English and doubts on the solution of Spain and Portugal are only to increase the Russian cost, become a rather than the lakes of their material (states, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided not to do the movement to Zurich and declared a "local competition in the preparation of the vote" in an attempt to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"In the bowl cover, we're trying to check them," said Mr. Poutine.
For 2022, the United States, strong of the experience in 1994, appear as logical favors.
First of the World Economic Power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a long-term progress on Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates appear to be premature for two countries that have organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the worldial-2026 to China, abroadly wished by Fifa, which would actually cause Asian chances for 2022.
With the Qatar, who has gone out the great game in proposing futurist cities, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion to new constraints, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Corea, could also paint the weakness of the achieved TV rights (with the time delay) by the European countries, the nerf of war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
Gaulle's really happy.
Mitterrand did believe he was heat.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the most hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less than they.
A mandate to Elisea calls another.
So the current chief of the State will be candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence does not make good mistakes with the part of mystery associated with the presidential function.
So we need to do as if the doubt is always existing.
In a sense like in the other.
In 2006, even without believe, Jacques Chirac's friends suggested that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assures that he would take his decision "which part is at the top of 2011."
That he calls before the UMP Parliamentars, March to Elizabeth, the perspective of "two mandates" has seen a little febrility.
Is that the official announcement of his candidate?
We were far away.
The President just reminded that the Constitutional Revision of 2008 was limited to two to the number of five-year-olds.
He made a constat, not a announcement.
This is not the first time he calls the President, on the ton of humor, when such meetings are.
"The worse, or the best, you have it yet for seven years and half with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think of the next step."
His proposals are not more candidate than the veil; they do it not less.
If they suffer comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the course to the candidate to the PS, one part.
But this isn't the income of the Royal Segol√©ne, which put Nicolas Sarkozy to devote.
It is, in contrast, because his candidate in 2012 is clear that many of the PS are a preliminary range of wars than proposed.
The bad sondages, on the other hand.
For the first time, the right electorers would prefer Francois Fillon's candidate to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion about the UMP," immediately and exactly reacted on the surrounding of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the possible deficit, he will not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin trusts.
"He will always be able to win," corrects Alain Jupp√©, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its state titles
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to determine the criteria of exit or, at least, to announce a great number of non-conventional operations of monetary policy operations that should be accomplished at the end of the year.
The crisis of the obvious European Sovereign Affairs, Francfort's emission institution will not be sure that it may be even perpetratory in mind to achieve a situation more than today on European obligatory markets.
The political cost would be exceeding higher.
Yesterday, at the time of a press conference, the Minister of French Finances, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in order to resolve the crisis of state debts in Europe.
She didn't want to say if she estimated that the central bank should be done more, for example, increased its programme of competence of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my opinion to my European partners (...)."
In Brussels, during its audience by the Commission of Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been shown more about its intentions, pleaseing to indicate that the programme of achievement of state titles on the secondary market is "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" in the meeting of this July.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main rate in 1%, its lower historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the Tresor commitments by the ECB have doubled the last week, about 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indications of market operators, it would have made new achievements of Irish and Portuguese titles yesterday.
In total, the central eurosystem banks purchased for 67 billion euro since May 2010.
In the meaning of the market operators, the advantages of a purchased purchases do not doubt (see page 29).
Economists don't expect noticed changes.
If the price operations have already been lost from the ECB's arsenal, the last procedure continues to unlimited liquidity allocations in accordance with generous conditions and for periods for a week to three months.
Economists are waiting for this device for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she changes importantly his program."
"If it would take the risk of carrying new tensions," Michael Schubert, the commerzbank's economist.
"A progressive outcome announced during the first trimester 2011 appears to be more probable," ancient of his side Norbert Br√§ms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the plan of its interventions on the market of the public debt, "The ECB should include a volume of achievement of these obligations to animate an atone market," adds Norbert Br√§ms.
With regard to the importance of the expositions of European banks on the markets of the euro area, the emissment institution has no other choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to be replaced by the missing investors on the market and to do such a way to prevent an emergency of the payments paid by the most fragiles States," a major obligatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest levels are involving, States will now be more generous to reduce their finality, except to stabilize it.
The euro's safeguard is at this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi makes the two rounds
After the beginning of a week concerned for Italy, the situation was a little deteriorated, yesterday, with the refluence of obligatory levels to 10 years.
Return to the preceding calm.
When the Economic Ministry was out of a meeting, the regional presidents had said that Giulio Tremonti had heard the situation of "indecryptable" and waited for a weekend "improvisible", which then the interested interest was deployed.
Marty, in any case, the excursion with the long-term rate had achieved the record of 210 base points and the price of covering contracts against the failure risk (CDS) had been affected to 263 points, in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the excursion with German tax was more than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said, "fortunately concerned" by "market turbulences" and a possible convention in Irlanda.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Irland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the absence of growth and atom of fiscal retries that goes with, running to the State the risk of no longer to cover its financial needs.
The last provisions of Brussels were a frozen dust for the Government.
The Italian growth is therefore expected to 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012, while the current review budget in the Senat table is respectively 1,3% and 2%.
In these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4,3% of the PIB next year (including 3.9% of the Government) and 3,5% in 2012 (in place of 2.7%).
From where a new budgetary collector could be placed after the feasts, for amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new external measures should be taken," the Committee on Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order, and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," ensures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian manager to the International Monetary Fund of Italy to the FMI.
"No problem is in the immediate, nor on the court or long term, because, although it is important, (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation efforts requested in Italy are more than those requested for other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the Economic of the OECD.
It remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a movement of censure to the Deputy Chamber, after which anticipated elections could be organised by the end of March.
It would then be opened a small period for decision-making in case of serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of anticrisis devices
Christine Lagarde still married it in the framework of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have still shown it in the day and night, are clearly solid, determined to defend their monetary and their monetary areas."
Although all related, the registered detention on the levels of the European State's obligations has brought water to the moulin of governments and the ECB.
But we can't even talk about a start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Agency announced that it could degrade the note of the debt in Portugal, the most visible target today by the specification.
"In May, there is a real failure of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly on bank systems", including Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Moreover, "the political time is very least than the time of markets."
Conscious of this hyatus and the dangers that he receives, European countries intensify the discussions to strengthen existing anticrisis devices.
The reporting consultations between the Ministers of Finances are directly concerned and, more widely, with their Parents of G20 will be good training.
And this also regards the meetings of the European Group and Ecofin of the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the result of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market collector (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stabilisty Fund (FESF), his Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started married in Singapore to report the extreme-oriented investors of the crisis development in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to arise funds, it will certainly prepare the land.
The first emissions of the FESF shall be provided in the next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative trusted the Reuters Agency that the United States would support an advanced increase of funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment to the FMI.
The countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain, as well as they, are appropriate to adopt structural reforms, especially on the organization of the work market.
Reforms which are added to the outerity measures more closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different way from the Greece and Ireland.
One and the other takes a price to refuse to ask an international assistance before enableing their own budgetary corrections and to decide essential structural reforms to continue confidence.
European fund bathrooms, finally, are involved on the available options to accelerate the normalization process of sovereign obligations.
From pass to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced that if 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be sufficient, the Union would not have had to take the hand to the portfolio.
Barclays Capital economists, an actor of all the first plan of the European Sovereign Deal, judged that a range of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, " preference" under the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism on this day 60 billion euros.
An advice that has all the chances to be considered carefully in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were empirical.
Snow and snow: 24 Orange monitoring departments
Negattive episodes still enhanced circulation difficulties, especially on the secondary network in England, and risks to suffer some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are then on the orange monitoring because of the risk of snow and glass.
The Eure, Eure and Loir, the Due Severes and the Vienna, has been added to 20 departments already in Orange vigilance, 18 from Friday after midnight and two, Dordonia and Gironde later in the night.
According to Meteo France, supported snows affect the north of Gironde and Charentes and snow lowly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow boards from 2 to 5 cm, at the point of 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Coasts of Armor, Finist√®re, Gironde, Dordonia, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ille-de-France and Limousin.
The neglective episodes are sufficiently notable to enhance circulation difficulties and to suffer some economic activities, the Meteo France.
In the Coasts of Armor, several departments have been prohibited to more than 7,5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac.
The circulation on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarms that recommend not to take its vehicle only in the case of need and the circulation of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transports were prohibited for judiction in Picardia.
No specific measures were considered to be restricted to the circulation of weights.
The prefecture "invites all carriers to the greatest proudness on the roads and adapt their conduct in consecutive ways."
The General Director of the Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested aircraft companys to announce 25% of their flights on Roissy Airport and 10% in Orly because of the future snow challenges.
The DGAC recommends air passagers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and the Edinburgh, in Ecosse, are closed until the morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First Financial Squises
Since the debate around the modernization of transports in Ille-de-France was full, billion flows.
In the debate at least.
We are called in particular 23 billion for the Grand Paris Meter that must build the Grand Paris Society.
In order to start this SGP, the State announced a capital of 4 billion euros.
In the theory scheme, it is the sum that will then allow SGP to overcome on the markets a part of the financing of its double bucle.
Today, we're finally going to the first additions.
The 2010 Regional Finance Act, considered in the Commission of the National Assembly's Financial Committee, contains the devices provided for for to find the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special rate of equipment and a increased rate on the offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the law project, article 15, is "the benefit of the public establishment of the Grand Paris."
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a ream√©nagement of a tax on the offices already existing "for modernizing it, to increase the product and to affect this increase in the Grand Paris Society."
How much did this report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is determined that these fiscal resources are added to 4 billion euros of capital donation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society to the road and measure of the project," may be read in the exposition of the motives.
In SGP, we don't find this shoking system.
"From the time we were created recettes (the two taxs, ndlr), you can cover studies for three years and tackle in the four billion later, explain it."
"This will be inscribed in the budget and shooting in the ground and measure."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will be insert in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised is still to the absent subscriptions, is risked to make a parliamentary discussion a little age.
First meeting public on 7 December.
Hackers winds and spices in diligence
WikiLeaks' case has a double value.
On one hand, she appears to be an apparent scannel, a scanning that appears not as a scandal but before the hypocrisy that regulates the reports between States, citizens and pressure.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level, and provides a future dominated by the regression.
But we're in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each folder constituted by a secret service (of any nation that is) is exclusively composed of pressure curves.
The American "extraordinary" revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi are just reporting what had been able to read in any journal (for those who are owner of Berlusconi), and the left caricating profile of Khadafi was a long time for the sketch-cabart artists.
The rule that secret dossiers should be composed only of news already known is essential to the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated to etoterical publications, you will see that each work is repeated (for the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templiers or Rose-Croix) exactly what was written in the previous works.
And it is not only because the author of hidden texts doesn't like to do inevitable researchs (not know where to look for news on the injector), but because those who want to be in the occultism believe only that they already know, and who recognizes what they have already learned.
It's the achievement mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
It's the same way for the secret folders.
The Informer is amazing, and the manager of the secret services (if it may be, I know, editor to Liberation), who are not rejected as true as what he recognizes.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American embassy of Rome sent to the State Department were the same as the Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the reports on these articles make so much sound?
On one hand, they say that everyone who is cultivated already knows that the ambassades, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of States can telephone or take a air to meet, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small representation exercises, have been transformed in the centers of spionage.
Every spectacular of research films knows that very well, and it's just by hypocrisy that we're doing it like ignoring it.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the debt of hypocrisy, and serves to place the American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country of the world has a non-negliggable case at the prestige of the State department.
So the scandal doesn't make the victims and the "bourreaux".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
Jadis, during Orwell's time, we could make all powers like a Big Brother who controled each gesture of his subjects.
The orwellian prophecy was completely achieved since, when it could control each move through the phone, every operation done, the visited hotel, the authorized and then, the citizen became the total victim of the power.
But when it is shown, as it happens now, that even the secrets of the power can not escape from the control of a hacker, the control report stops to be unidirectly and become circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - election as a gainer of the citizens - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that has no more the possibility to keep his own secrets?
It is true, George Simel said already that a true secret is an empty secret (and the empty secret will never be devoted); it is also true, that everything to know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it is relevant to the public area; but to show, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets meaning him to remove all powers.
WikiLeaks did no wrong in Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound infected in a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will not have any reserved information on the internet - it would be returned to publish it on a view cold at the road.
But it is very clear that with the current technologies, it is just to hope that it is possible to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Not easier than discover if and when a staff leader moved in the air and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be treated in the future?
I know, at the moment, my prevision is exhausted from science-fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obvious to imagine the government's agents who are discreetly moved in the diligences to non-controlled inheritors, with only portors of messages learned by heart, or, at least, hiding the amazing information written in a chaussure.
The information will be stored in a single copy in key shooters: on the bottom, the Watergate spionage trial has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology now comes to crazy, it's like to turn around.
A centuries after the telegraph has revolutioned communications, the Internet has restored a telegraph on children (telephonics).
Videos (analogic) had permitted researchers in cinema to explore a film in step, walking forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the mount, while now the CDs (numerical) allowed only to save the chapter in chapter, which means by macroportions.
With great speed trains, we're going from Rome to Milan for three hours, while at the air, and the movement that he includes, we need three hours and half.
It is therefore not that the policy and communication techniques return to the horse cars.
A last observation.
On the other hand, the press tried to understand what happened in the secret of the ambassads.
Today, these are the members who ask confidential information on pressure.
Climat: how the France bidues its financial promises
A year after the Copenhague Agreement, it is time to consider the respect of the promises of rapidly discharged funding (thes fast start or precoces) made by developed countries.
And the big French biduillas are discovered.
In the Copenhague Agreement, developed countries were committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7,2 billion for three years and France 1,26 billion euros (ass 420 billion per year).
In the opening of the COP16, the EU has gone out the great game to persecute his partners of the reality of its commitment on fast-start finances: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, big side event, brochure distribution...
The transparency operation is valuable and apprehensive to its right value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same level.
The EU announced it in 2010 2,2 billion euros, which puts it on the right path for the respect of its commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at it in the detail, things are more complex.
This money must be, according to the Copenhague Agreement, "new and additional", to ensure that additional efforts are made without the delay of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement about what means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some Member States who have blocked the procedure.
Today, everybody chooses the reference that will be the best to him.
For example, the European Commission considered reference in 2009: International funds are maintained, and it adds 150 million for three years to fast-start funds.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of public assistance to development.
In contrast, France estimates that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
Furthermore, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous years or at the global level of public assistance to development.
In particular, the total amount of the support of France to developing countries may remain stabil (or even reducing), it is intended to respect its commitment to "new and additional funds"...
Another crucial element, distribution between donations and preparations.
There still is no rules and each one chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, considered that $1 is equal to $1.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of price can be justified for certain investments that are rentable (because projects related to the achievement of emissions on more effective technologies), it is not possible to present a euro that will be reached as equal to a euro that is given to it, but it should not be complied with its commitments as the cost of the payer country (if it is equal to a interest).
However, France has to make such reasons: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by 91.5% of the costs (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of dollars (36.1 million euros) - see the EU's document to check yourself.
It is the only Union country to use as much as the price.
Germany requires 46%, while Germany, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) respect their commitments with 100% of donors.
Furthermore, when the greatest majority of the European Union has 1$ to satisfy its commitment, France only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Joli Password turn!
In summary, in its fast start funding, France works a double scrokery: one part on the development of action in time and other parts on the reality of financial efforts.
With only 36,1 million euros, she believes that she spends 420 million "new and additional" in coherence with her promises.
The manipulation of the Financial Ministry (for it seems that Bercy has made the army) could have a double negative impact in the EU (for other Member States would continue to give it if it is enough to offer) and in negotiations because developing countries are not completely duplicated...
The chapter of the previous finances is only a small question of short-term relationship, in relation to the entire discussions on climate.
But it could be a grain of more sable in the larger machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that it's not the case.
Whatever, it is indispensable to take the readings of this first year of previous funds.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a respect of its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could advance the discussions on long-term financial benefits (the other critical chapter currently discussed): it will not be issued on the question of "additionality" or of the mode of accounting of the prices.
France may change its position to become progressist as well on those ages that it is on others.
The hope is therefore resting on the new Minister of Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizett, which will come to Cancun next week.
A surprised announcement on the fast beginning of France and on its view of "additionality" and the use of prices would be to increase the needed international confidence level to progress in discussions.
Advertising to the incoming pepticides by children
A 10-year-year-old child in a day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published by the Genesis Association (ex-Moviment for the rights and the respect of future generations).
The Association, which prevents that its results "not have significant statistical value in respect of the low number of analysised examples, but are illustrative of the treatment problem," was buyed between July and September the foods generally consumed in four foods and a day by a child of ten years, in the overmarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types, including official recommendations - five free fruits and flows, three latiers products and 1,5 litres of water per day - and fridishes, were examined by laboratories to search for chemical substances, pesticides, hard metals and other pollutants.
The assistance budget is achieved: 81 chemical substances which 42 are classified, possible or probable, and five Classified cancerary substances, and 37 substances to act as endocrinian perturbators (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Research Centre on the Cancer.
"Even though, at least totally, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, we see in our research that the reality of the consumers' exposition to cancer polluants may be concerned and/or PE is concerned," notes the association.
For the small dinner, the beer and the tee at the lake contains them only more than one decade of cancerrigan residues, and three aircrafts like certain cancerrig√®nes, and nearly a 20-year-old residues to suffer the hormonal system.
The pomme, imported from Brazil, provided as a result of the study, presents six chemical substances, which still have been intermitted in France.
Even for the Green Haircotes in Kenya, including in the dinner, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the steak hacked, the throat in box, and even the bread baguet and the chewing gom were threatened with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the robot, the analysis declared the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For the dinner, the steak of saumon was the most "rike" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the exam of the plastic asylum used to reach the food to micro-ond was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminants" is probably substituted, according to the study.
The European Economic-Les Verts (EEE-LV), on its side, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratoire on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Security Agency (EFSA) made the presence of 365 pesticides identified in the use of fruits and fruits in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
