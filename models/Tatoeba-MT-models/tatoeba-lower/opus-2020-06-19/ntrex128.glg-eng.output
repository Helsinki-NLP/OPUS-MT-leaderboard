The members of the Gales Assembly preocupalles "they take them by monikers"
Consternation between some of the members of the Assembly, in the present named in English AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name by the MWP (Mr. of Gales).
The debate was judged by the plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the entire assembly are afraid to be an object of rediculation.
One member of the Laboratory Party said that his group was concerned that the new name "rima with Twp and Pwp".
For those who didn't know galles, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru Partie showed that the group's conjunction was not happy and suggested alternative.
A galaxy conservator said that his group holds a "pleasure open" in touching the name change, but he decreased that from MWP to Muppet is just a little verbal salt.
In this context, the "w" letter in galaxy pronounces a similar way to the word in Yorkshire of the letter "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which currently edits the lexislation to introduce the changes of name, declared: "Obviously, the final decision on any description of the members of the Assembly will depend on their own members."
The Act of the Government of Gales of 2017 has organized the assembly the power to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation carried out on these proposals that showed much support to the name of the Parliament of Gales.
In regard to the case of the title of AM, the Commission prefered members of the Gales or WMP, but the MWP option has received most support in a public consultation.
It seems that AMs are suggesting alternative, but the fight to achieve the consensus could cause a head pain for the President Elin Jones, which is expected to give the law project on the changes in the weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the AM's inhabilitation rules and the design of the Committee's system.
The AM will receive the final vote on how they should be called when they discuss the lexislation.
Makedonians encoding urnes in reference to the name of the country
The electorers will vote the Sunday's name to the "North Macedonian Republic".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a debate that has already been decades with the near Greece, which has a provincie called Macedonia.
Athens takes a lot of time in insisting that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a reclamation of its territory and is repeatedly opposed to its EU and OTAN approval requests.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is contrary to the change of name, said that it would be an occasion of voting.
However, the defenders of the reference, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, support that the change of name is not more with the price that you have to pay to join the EU and OTAN.
The camps of St. Martin keep silent while the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders with what I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every scene," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor another."
He said he could understand that the bars would lose.
"Now socialism people other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of being barriers to which people are normally going."
In touching the churches, I'm afraid that the money of activity is not so long as the leaders wait, and "forward or then they're going back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by buildings of apartments with companions of full owners of people who would not help the barriers continue to be sanctuary.
"The most people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," said he, "and so they will accelerate the close of all these churches, because it's less likely that the new owners will be members of those churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem becomes a black metropolitical community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation has changed in 30 years.
A near congregation was made with the building.
St. Martin was busy by a black congregation held by the reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boot to the streets of the street 125, a trade street of Harlem, who resisted to contract and up to black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the very dead building, but as the father Johnson's flowers made plans to rebuild it, they carried the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, was baptized with honor the carillon as "the camps of the poor."
The expert that touched the carillon in July called another way: "A cultural throat" and "unsubstitutive history tool."
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also described that it was the first carillon of the world touched by a black music, Dionisio A. Lind, which changed it by the greatest carillon of Riverside's church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said nobody's worried his place in St. Martin.
Those who leaving St. Martin during the last months are a group of architects and contractors, some leading by the lake leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parroquial joint, the body that regrets the parroquia and is composed of lacky leaders, wrote to the diocese in June, showing his concern for this last "seeks to repair the costs" to together, although this does not participate in the contract of the architects and the contracts that sent the dioceses.
Some frequencies were broken from the failure of transparency by the diocese.
A tiburon makes a kid during the lagous fish in California
The police reported that a tiburn attacked and smoked a 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath while he practiced submarine fishing in the search of lyrics in California on the first day of the time of the cross.
The attack was produced a little before the seventh morning near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell ran to KSWB-TV in San Diego who took about half hour mergularly with friends the Sunday morning when he heard the kid asking to help the bars, at the time he was born with a group of people to help the water out of the water.
Hamel said that at the beginning I thought it was only emotion for fishing a lame, but then he declared that I was crying, "They tried me!
They worked me!"
I had the snipped keyboard." He said he was deceived when he came to the boy.
"Bring him to all the people who went out of the water: ' There's a tiburn in the water!", Added Hammel.
The boy was transferred to the childhood in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
Unknown the type of tiburn responsible for attack.
The sugarist, Captain Larry Giles, said in a pressur round to divide a tiburn in the area a few weeks ago, but they're determined that it's not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage in the top of the tower.
The officers closed access to the street from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, until Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to carry out a research and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of tiburns in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to be introduced on the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsbury's is concurring with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with a similar nice courses with the large stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable inmersion on the market of the Beauty of the United Kingdom, which goes up to 2.800 million libraries and continues to grow while the sales in mode and products to fire, the larger carriers with beautiful products are testing in 11 tens of the whole country, and then they will pass to others in the next year have success.
Investment in beauty produces a moment when supermarkets seek to fill the stains that at their day took TV, microondes and fire products.
Sainsbury's stated that he would offer her beautiful products until he arrived from 3000 products, including the first time marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more spaces with similar exclusive areas than they can be seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket also raises its Boutic machine gamma so that most of the products are approximate to see us, something more demanded by the newest client.
In addition, the perfumes tent, The Fragrance Shop, will test conceptions in two Sainsbury's institutions; the first opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the past week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The online buying and a change that is translated in buying a small quantity of food daily in small tens implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the Executive President of Sainsbury's, said that the institutions will always seem more to trade centres, because the supermarket chains are trying to concurrence with disorders like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non- food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat's sale points in hundreds of tents, because he buyed the two rows two years ago. So, this has strengthened the sales of companies and rewarded the acquisitions.
The previous trial of the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beautiful departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's put a initiative together with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the association came to his end after a discussion on how to share the income of pharmacies in his supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold her medicine business formed by 281 tensions in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chair, for 125 million libras three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a large gamma of luxury cosmetic marks including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 beds.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said, "We transform the image of our beauty carriers to improve our clients.
We also invest to personally formed that you can accuse to ask the advice.
Our gamma of products is designed to adjust all the needs and attractive locations and practices mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that disappeared to the old buy habits."

When Willoughby, 37 years old, returned to Instagram to announce that he left Truely, Jones took a fly to the British and directed one of his vacation residences.
A source said, "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It was his long-term future during the next two decades.
His decision to leave left atomics to all people who participated in the project.
Nobody could believe what happened to Martes, so close to the launch.
There was a full market store in Marlow's offices to sell."
Experts believe that the loss of this morning's presentator is between the most worthy stars of the Great Britain could cost you to the company of millions of libras, because of the considerable investment in products that go from the cookins and shoot the clothes and the textiles for the fire, and that could still be launched by their launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin's fathers of three sons and have a friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, since ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, of 52 years, was joined as President in March.
The couples were a couple of vacation and Jones had a participation of 40% in Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby will be converted to the M&S mark embs and will replace Ant McPartlin as representative in the ITV program I'm to Celebrity.

In contrast, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions directed to continue exercising pressure.
Trump adopted a lot more optimist vision in his middle talk.
"The things with the North Korea are good," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
They'd die millions of people.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationships with Kim had positive results: finishing with the tests with misiles, helping to release the reliefs and to make home to the rest of the United States soldiers.
And he defended his insolent strategy by talking about the relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this anfiteater, we would have some 200 people from here," said Trump, signing the people that had just before.

The Cromwell state of the Parliament is converted to the last monument affected by the fight by "rewrite history"
His prohibition would be poetical justice for its Taliban's destruction of many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and pure followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified the suggestion of Mr. Crick of "disparate" and "seek to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the department of states that the figure of Oliver Cromwell sits outside the Westminster Palace is turned to objective.
The iconoclastia of the English Civil Wars has not been ordered or implemented by Cromwell.
If it would have been sacrificed to Cromwell wrong by the actions of his debtor Thomas in the past century.
The great representation of Cromwell made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the existing opinion in the 19th century, and part of the history of a figure that many think that it continues to meet homenaxes.
Mr Goldsmith declared the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, maybe more the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of the Parliament before the external pressure, in this case, of course, he was treated with monarch.
If this is or not a complete representation is an object of a history debate continued.
What is clear is that the conflict of averages of the XVII century has defined the last development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisible figure that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also merciers of celebration and reminder."
A chinese killer snacks a chinese
According to local media, a pork attacked and assaulted a branch in the southwest China market.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the appeal, "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned arteria and covered blood near a carton on the Liupanshui market, in Guizhou province.
A porcino guarantee was prepared to put the vaccins to the ports in the cortle on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, in the provincie of Qinghai, China.
When he seemed to travel with his curman, the merchants from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 porches on the market.
On the next morning, his curman found him dead and discovered a open door that gave the other adjudicator.
He said there was a big blood smoke in the mouth.
The analysis was confirmed that the pork, about 250 kilos, attacked the branch until he killed it..
"My curman had the feet insensed and sneaked," said the chief, "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening Newing News.
The storage of the security camera shows Yuan in the market at 4:40 a.m. to give you food to his pools.
Your body was found a hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't of Yuan nor of his curman.
A market director told the Evening News that the porch was closed to prevent anybody to attack anybody more, while the police joined tests on the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they're not very common, they're already registered cases of porches that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pork attacked a woman and her husband in the branch that the couple had in Massachusetts, produced several lessons to the man.

The rest of the Rosa Furan will bring strong and generous rains to southwest U.S.
The previsions indicate that the Rosa Furacán is deactivated as long as the fresh waters are overwhelmed from the north cost of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring to the north of Mexico and southwest U.S. during the next days.
At the 5th morning of the Sunday, east hour, Rosa was a category 1 furacian with winds of over 135 km/h and was located at 620 miles of Ponta Eugenia, Mexico.
I hope Rosa's going for the north to the Sunday.
Since so, a valga begins to take a form on the Pacific Ocean and move to the east, directly to the East Coast of America. As Rosa is achieved to the Peninsula of the Down California on the sun as tropical torment, it will begin to emphasize tropical humity towards the north, which will penetrate in the southwest of America.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico every day.
Following, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valda will create strong and generated rains in southwest in the next days.
At the local level, the precipitations between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous repenting inunds, smoking flushes and the possibility of land disruptions in the wilderness.
The great tropical humidity will cause precipitations that will be achieved to 50 or 75 l/m2 in pointing areas, especially in South Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest hoped 50 to 100 l/m2 rain, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Possibility of repenting inunds with conditions in deterioration due to the spreading character of tropical rain.
We are uncovered in the wilderness under tropical rain threat.
The strong rain could form canons that could be converted to flowing rivers, and the electrical torments will bring winds locally broken and pool.
The valda will bring rains locally strong to the parts of the southern Coast of California.
The entire precipitations could be achieved more than 12 l/m2, which at its time could cause flux of smaller and swaddle streets.
These would be the first rain of the rain station of the region.
The tropical rains will begin to achieve Arizona at the last hours of the Sunday and the first day, before the rain is exceeding the end of the sun and the martyrs.
Great rain will come to Four Corners or martes, which will lead to the merchants.
October will be a witness of large temperature oscillations in the U.S. dependent on Artico's suffering, although the tropicals will remain very calm.
In times this affects important temperature changes in short distances.
The Sunday we can see a great example of driving temperature differences in the U.S. Center.
There will be a difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next days, the constant steal will try to reaper and expand again.
For the central and east part of the country hopes a challenge start of October, with temperatures that will exceed 26 degrees from the southern planets to the northest parts.
New York could get 26 degrees to martes, which are about 12 degrees above the average.
Our meteorological prevision for long terms indicates great probabilities of temperatures above the average to the east of the country during the first half of October.

Ford said to the Junior Committee of the Senate that it's hundreds of sure that Kavanaugh has made it to touch it as he was broken and tried to put his clothes into a party in the institution.
In a favored witness, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that it wouldn't happen.
Nilens reported the winds that more than 20,4 million people would have seen it.
The company reported the media audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other strings that re-transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nillen agrees to have problems to meet people who see the television from offices.

ABC was second with 3,26 million.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2.52 million second Nisen.
After the judgment, the interest is persistent.

He stayed with the low look for several minutes while he was retraced, televisioned directly in the CNN.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told him, "You have the power while there are many undefenced women."
Flake said that his office made a flake declaration, before he closed the assenger, he added that he would have more than to say in the Committee audience.
All television strings and cave were transmitted in direct hours after the Judge Committee had to vote to progress the name of Kavanaugh before the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said that it would only do that if the FBI investigated alloys against the named next week, something they put a democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations held with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and with several senators, Flake took a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to apply Kavanaugh without research.
President Trump opened a investigation against Kavanaugh.

According to IA Kai-Fu Lee, Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should duplicate the quantity you invest in IA in view of China's growth activities in the field.
The comments were produced after several parts of the United States government have made an announcement on IA, even if the U.S. carrying a formal strategy on IA.
Since so, China presented its plan in the past year: he wanted to be the number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicate the research budget in IA would be a good beginning, since the other countries are much more behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big progress in IA," said Lee.
Duplicating the financing could double the probabilities that the next IA achievement is made in the U.S., Lee said to the CNBC in a interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is a general director of Synovation Ventures, which invested into one of the Chinese IA companys: Face++.
In 80 years in Carnegie Mellon university, he worked in a IA system that wins the American Othello player with more score and later was executed in Microsoft Research in the Google office in China.

The National Fund of Chinese Natural Sciences provides financing people of academic institutions as well as the National Fund of Science and other governmental organizations district money to the US researchers, but the quality of academic work is less in China, said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Defence Department established an artificial intelligence Centre that is destined to include the industries and university partners, and the White House announced the training of the selected artistical information Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.

The Macedonia vote with reference to the name of the country.
The Macedonia people voted the Sunday in the reference if he wanted to change his name to the "North Macedonian Republic", a movement that would resolve a discussion since a decade with Greece, and that he blocked the admission requests in the European Union and in the OTAN.
Greece, which has a provincies called Macedonia, keeps the name of its neighbors in the north represents a reclamation from its territory and entered its enterprise in the OTAN and the EU.
Governments of the two countries have arrived to a agreement in June on the new proposed name, but nationalists believe that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slava population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a box campaign has suffered doubts about if the result would be achieved at 50 per cent of the minimum needed to be valid.
The question mentioned in the reference paper was, "Is it favorable to the OTAN and the EU's accession with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The Defenders of the name change, among them, the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are pleased to admit that it is a price that is the penalty for paying in the entities such as the EU or the OTAN of Macedonia, one of the emergency countries of Yugoslavia's falling.
"Today I voted for the future of the country, by the Juvenile of Macedonia, to live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, of 79 years, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of the Parliament said that they would end up the result of the vote and that they would make it definitive.
The change of nine would need a majority of two thirds of the Parliament.
The State election committee stated that at 1 p.m was not registered any irregularity.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last Parliament's elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I voted by my sons, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a voter of 62 years of capital, Skopje.
The first minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted to the Macedonia reference on the change of the name of the country that would open the path to its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the presence of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scenario and set chairs before the mounted tents for which they would refer to.
"We are pleasant to join the OTAN and the EU, but we want to do it with high head and not by the service door, he added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can accuse other countries like China and Russia and form part of the Eurasiatic Union."
The first Minister Zaev says that the OTAN adherence will bring the investment as necessary to Macedonia, which has a rate of disemployment above 20 per cent.
"I believe that most of our citizens will be pleased because more than 80 percent of our citizens are favorable to enter into the EU and OTAN," Zaev commented to vote.
He said that a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A reported investigation published last lunch by the Macedonia Political Research Institute declared that between a 30 and a 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, the number that is under the requirement.
Another research carried out by the Macedonian television string Telma indicated that 57% of the consulted persons were planning to vote the Sunday.
The 70 percent said he would vote.
In order to be valid, the result must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the reference would represent the first important battle for the policy of the Western Government since he would access the power in May to the past.

When the Moment Activitys of my local party voted to censure me, the truth is that you didn't surprise me too much.
After all, I'm the last of a number of laborists who are not well received, and all of us to say our opinion.

I'm sorry, that isn't the ton of many meetings, and the promise of a "beloved and generous" policy has forgotten a lot of time, if it's ever started.
Every time it is clearer that the laboratory party does not take different opinions and is jury if all the opinions are acceptable to the leader of the game.
This started a little after Jeremy became leader of the party, when partners who wanted to share a similar political vision began to wait for me to retreat and to adopt postures with those who would never agree, it is in national security as the unique market of the EU.
When I speak publicly, and in fact of a little like what you say, there is a threatened attract and attacks in social networks censuring the central policy, telling me that it should not be at the Laboratory Partie.
And it's not just me.
Actually, I know I'm more happy than some of my partners, because the comments that lead to my boys are political.
Imagine me the professionality and the definition of the companies that are faced to a tower of sexist or racists every day and that they don't disappear.
One of the most decepting aspects of this was the policy is how the insulting levels were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn confirmed the last week that the Laborist Party had to promote a tolerance culture.
The fact is that we're not so open and that with each move of "no trust" or every change in the selection rules, the game becomes more stressful of looks.
During the last years, I received a lot of advice that wanted me to keep my head attached, not to be so frank, and then "all would be good for me."
But I wasn't in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Laborist Partie, there is 32 staying still in the school, led by the uncleanness of the Thatcher government that literally leaves to fall my school, I tried to recall better public services for those who need them, as well as local counselors as Minister of Government.
I've never hid my policy, nor yet in the last choice.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused in cases of my political postures and I am not in accordance with the current direction of the Partie.
To those who promoted the movement of the wines, the only one that would say to him is that while the country walks to a Brexit that will affect our fires, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to lose time and energy asking my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Moment, but for my electors, be members or not of the party: I am honourable of serving them and I promise that no threat or political convention will deny me to act as I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 More: a invite Ayr is headed
It is possible that the two last trials may change a little bit of the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr had to win this mixed part of the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they'll lead the table and it's the only invited team of the ten.
Finally, it was the highest of his defense, as well as the fact of risk, he brought the team to the victory, and the advocator Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"To now we've put the test in our party and followed invites, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said, "You must recognize that the Ayr has used the best opportunities than we."
The test at 14 minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, was put before Ayr, but a yellow card for the captain Rory Hughes, ceased to the party by Warrios, allowed Melose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot appeared a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage to the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, transformed a shooting in solitary, leaveing the marker 17-5 for the Ayr in the rest.
But Melrose started well at the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the vantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the serious lesion that suffered Ruarý Knott, who left the field in padiola and, from the restart, Ayr progressed more through a test of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain dde Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose went out to have a player more with a test of Bruce Colvine who didn't consume, at the end of a long pressure period.
However, the local team returned and when Struun Hutchinson received the yellow card to place Climo when he had no ballon, McPjherson framed a test from the penalty line on the back side of Ayr.
Climo framed, as he did almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected the launch in the area of David Armstrong and sent him to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth test of the local team.
The Protagonist of Still Game starts a new carrier in the restauration industry
The star of Still Game, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after finding that it was called director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interpret Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular series, who writes and coprotagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that next nine times will be the definitive, and Kierman seems to plan another life after Craiglang.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make comments, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to involve in the "prosper business of the restaurants" of Glasgow.
"The sea is our," the internal Bolivia hopes that the court is the way to the Pacific
The mariners saw a seat covered ship of cameras in The Peace.
The public buildings are a blue colour flag.
ship bases from the Titicaca ship to Amazonas are broken from the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Recover it is a debt."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a cost lost before Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century continues alive, as the angel of replacement through the Pacific Ocean.
If these hopes are in its highest point in decades, Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of freedom.
"Bolivia has the needed impulse, a spirit of unit and serenity and, of course, expect a positive deal," stated Roberto Calzadilla, a bolivian diplomatic.
Many bolivians will see the CIX sentence in guarding screens throughout the country with the hope that the Court of Haia is proclaimed for the reputation of Bolivia and that, after decades of intermitting conversations, Chile sees thanks to negotiate Bolivia's concession to a highway outside the sea.
Evo Morales, the Indian Carismatic President of Bolivia, who faces a polemica battle for the next year, has also a lot of game in the judgment of the sun.
"We're very close to return to the Pacific Ocean," promised the end of August.
But some analysts think that the court's reasons for Bolivia, and that it's a little change if it happens.
The United Nations organization with the Season in the Netherlands does not have power to assist the Chile Territory, and has stated that it would not determine the result of possible conversations.
The fact that the CIX sentence comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "not was complicated", the chilene expert on international peace.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could be late.
"The subject of access to the sea takes a lot of time locked by the current bolivia administration," states Zarate.
The Belizer Retory of Morales sent the good will that left him in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will take the conversations at a moment, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries take no interchange of embassors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court had been taken in usually quickly.
Bolivia's lunch will have a great opportunity to open a new stage of relationships with Chile, and a chance to end up to 139 years of agreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, even one of the most popular Presidents in Latin America, had been using this subject with political purposes.
"Bolivia will never reject your right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," added.
"The judgment is a chance to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not be produced as long as he can trust in the United States.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs in North Korea, Ri Yong, states that its nation will not go to nuclear disarmament if you can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke the Sabbath in the United Nations General Assembly.
He called the United States to fulfil the promises made during a crowd in Singapore among their leaders.
This comment produces a moment when the state secretary of the U.S., Mike Pompeo, seems to be the point of restarting the nuclear diplomation established for more than three decades after the fulfillment of the north Korean leader, Kim Jong One.
It says that it's a "usopy" that the continuous sanctions and objetions of the United States to a statement that ends the Korean War can double north.
In Washington, it is rejected to accept the statement without Pyongyang's first step before disarmament.
Like Kim and President Donald Trump want a second trip.
But there is the generalised sceptricism that Pyongyang speaks seriously to renew an assessment that the country probably looks like the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang or next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump.
Paris's mode defiles show the last line of giant shadows that will be immediately in the tents.
If you want to increase your shadow collection or well cut off the entire sun, don't search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers showed a series of accessible extravagants for their primavery collection 2019 who opened the public with the most cleanest style of Paris Moda.
The impossible shadows fulfilled Instagram this vision, and these designers brought her to pass their most amazing creatures.
The main piece of Valentino was an excerbing smooth bathroom adorned with a wide board imiting plots that injured the heads of the models.
In the other large size accessors there were sandwichs, a mago shadow and even a pig, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of masks... just time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had the cosed lips and seemed more to Hannibal Lecter than the high cost.
One of the creations seemed to be a entire merguly team, with the hairs and the tube, and others a smooth steel.
And if it's a big mode, it's happy.
The understanding in mode predicted that the giant eggs could come to the tents.
The disproportioned shadows come just after the "Bomba", the ball shadow with a map of 60 cm that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The worship mark that is behind the impossible shadow that invade all social networks brought it to another great creation: a ball ball ball nearly as large as the model attached with a bath trace that takes it.
The larance raffine bowl adorned with raffy flocks and finished with a white corner ashes, was the destacated piece of the primary collection year 2019 of Jacquemus' La Riviera in the week of Paris's mode.
The famous Luke Armitage style declared FEMAIL: "I hope that the shadows and the shadows of large balls are coming to the tens of the next year, since the designer had a great impact that would be hard to ignore the request of oversize accessories."
John Edward: language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland keep a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of results overall in the tests, which is only strengthened by the individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community materials.
With more than 300,000 students in all school, these schools represented by the Counsel of Private Schools (SCIS by their siglas in English), they are trying to offer the best level to the students and the ass of their parents.
Private schools have as a objective to prepare their students for high education, for the carrier they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As educational sector that can design and implement a measured study plan, we see modern languages continue to be popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that you understand, that's the head.
But if you talk to him in his own language, he'll come to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not depend on English only when we want to establish relations and confidence with other countries.
From the results of the recent tests of this year, we can see that languages are on the highest of the table and the highest approved levels in private schools.
A 68% of the students who studied strange languages obtained a sursalent.
The data, recomplied from 74 schools in accordance with the SCIS, show that 72% of the students have obtained honor materials in Mandarin, while a 72% of those who studied German, a 69% of those who studied French and a 63% of those who studied Spanish, also lodged a sursalent.
This shows that school private schools support languages and consider key abilitys that children and young men will need in the future.
In the present, languages have the same consideration as materials such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and all kinds.
An investigation made by the Commission for the employment and training of the United Kingdom in 2014, indicated that between the missing of language knowledge is a 17% of the reasons that the company costs to cover vacances.
So, language skills are always more impressive to prepare younger for their future courses.
These possibilities are essential in the globalised world, because there are more work possibilities that require languages.
Independently from the elected carrier, if they learn a second language, they will have real advantage in the future with a lifeable ability like this.
To be able to communicate directly with people of other countries will put a person directly to the head of competition.
According to youGov's investigation between over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any strange language enough as well as to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language speaking by a percentage of two decimals, in this case a 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's children.
To recognize several languages, especially the economies in development, provides children more opportunities to find a significant job.
In Scotland, teaching languages are different according to school.
Some schools are focused in modern more classic languages, while others are described by more important languages considered for the United Kingdom to 2020, such as mandatory or Japanese.
Independently of what the interests of their children are, private schools always have several languages to choose and special teachers in this field.
Private schools are specialized in providing a training environment that prepares children and equips them with the needful opportunities to triumph, it is what you disappear the future.
We can not reject that in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative capacity".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for school youth.
We need to do it well.
John Edwards is the director of the election of private schools.
Libron starts with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait has almost finished for the seaters who want to see LeBron James playing first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team adestrator, Like Walton, announced that James will play the first party of the pre-time against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still to decide how many minutes you'll play.
"I'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the official web of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, published on Twitter that James probably would play a few minutes.
After the end of week beginning, James asked for his plans at the time of six parts of the Lakers.
These heights of my carrier are not needed to be ready to be ready," he said.
Trump's electional acts come to Virxinia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of half campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the 5 mile-programmed Trump for the next week, including the stops in African cities to him as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation in pause that its candidate covers the Vacante of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to achieve support for the next half of the mandate elections, since the Republicans run the risk of losing the control of the Congress on November.
What time is the middle of Trump in West Virginia, and how can you see it on the Internet?
The middle of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned today for Saturday 29 September 2018 to 7 p.m. ET.
You can see the middle of Trump in West Virxinia followed by YouTube retransmission directly.
Trump will probably treat the subject of the judge celebrated this week to the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been taken back by the unaccepted sexual conduct accusations and keeps in suspension the voting of the Senate for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of mitins is to help the Republicans to watch the elections of November with a new impulse.
Thus, these five miles that Trump will give to the next week have as objective "dinamination to volunteers and sympatients while the Republicans try to protect and expand most of them in the Senado and in the Representative room," says Reuters.
"The Congress Control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to many states as possible to the campaign temptation," said Reuters a voter of Trump campaign who prefered not to be named.
The middle of this night, which will be celebrated in Wesbanco Stadium, could gather the sympatients of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get covering the media of Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Sabbath will be the second time in the month when Trump visits West Virxinia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virxinia to the Senate Patrick Morrisey, the last in the research.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the President should come to support him in the reviews," said Simon Hader, the police of the West Virxinia University to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the United States Team shows sustainable to fight and maintain the hope to the individual parts of the Sunday
After three individual sessions, the Saturday saturday shooting could have been possible to be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscient impulsion pendel is a total deportive concept invented but in what the sportists believe real, and in particular in competitions like this.
Then, where would they say it's the impulse now?
"They had a vantage of six points and now are four, so I suppose we've taken it as a little impulse," said Jordan Spith while he went to the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four vantage points with twelve more games.
The United States, said Spieth, feels that they have a little wind to favor and much so that they can animate, among other things to Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each one account with three points of four.
Spith resulted letal from the tee to green and is preaching with example.
These guarantees were made stronger as he went forward to his round, makeing a crucial pump to pack the quarter party when he and Thomas were two points below two.
When he got the put that gave them to win the game on 15, he bought a similar egg, the type of egg that said he believes that the US team is not yet out.
"You only have to concentrate you and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing you're left to these players now.
18 bucks to leave it.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unexpectable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but loved European couple has four and they can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't make a bogey on the sabbath afternoon, but they also refused the Sabbath for the morning, the winds for the late and no last nine bucks or wines for the morning.
That passed, and the way it seems to fly their energy toward the multitude and from it, confirm them as the rivails to beat the Sunday, and couldn't have more popular players to get a victory when the sun is put on Le Golf National that Fleetwood or Molinari.
Likewise, the two at the same time in different bulks.
However, speak of European glory continues to be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly discovered to Sergio García, the heroe of the fireballs of the morning, when he spoke with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double in the first travel was finished with Spanish and Swedish in a bunker than they never were near to go out.
But the Sunday will not have anybody to help out of the boat.
The fireballs and the fuels are so fascinant to see nearly by interactions between the couples, the advice that are given, those who are not and the way you can change a strategy once.
Europe played better as a team until now, and they had a significant vantage last day, but this foursoms session also showed that the United States Team has been holding to fight, something that some, especially States, doubted.
Europe takes an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after out of fireballs and fires with 10-6 vantaxes over the United States.
The inspired two formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods with difficulties to go up four points to the bookmark in Le Golf National.
The European Team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to keep the trofe that lost two years ago in Hazeltine, has dominated a US team that missed in the morning fireballs, putting the series 3-1.
U.S. offered more resistance in the fires, winning four parts, but they couldn't recover the vantaxe.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points of 12 individual parts of the Sunday to keep the trofe.
Fleetwood is the first European news in winning four following points, while he and Molinari, accumulated "Molliwood" after a weekend, are the second couple in winning four points of the four initial parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After smoking Woods and Patrick Reed in the fireballs, they took the perfection to destroy a designed Woods and the new United States Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4 more category.
Woods, who solved two parts on the Sabbath without pain or glory, showed opportunities of lightness, but now he lost 19 of 29 parts in fireballs and fires and five followers.
Justin Rose, who was resting in the fireballs of the morning, returned to his parency Henrik Stenson in the shoes shooting a shooter against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka, numbers one and three of the world.
Europe could not always win in a favorable day of brise in South-East Paris.
The three times the campaign Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference point for the United States, getting two points on the Sabbath.
They gathered a 2 and 1 victory on the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fireballs and regained Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the two first bucks.
There were only two times in the history of Ryder Cup, where a team is mounted four points in individuals, although as the current throat titler, Furyk team only needs to be empathed to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, an attack of the Sunday seems to be out of his achievement.
North north of not on unilateral disarmament if you don't trust
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea informed the Sabbath to the United Nations that the continuous sanctions increased their untrustedness in the United States and that the country would not deliver their nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho communicated to the Year General Assembly that North Korea would adopt "important measures to show its good will" in the past year, as to stop nuclear tests and missions, dismantling nuclear test fields and controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer by the U.S." added.
"No trust in the United States will have no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first for our part."
While Ri rejected the known north-corean chess on the resistance of Washington to a "gradual" denuclearisation in which North Korea would be recompensed at the time he adopted measures, his statement seemed important, because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as happening with Pyongyang in the past.
He refered to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in the first top between a US President in active and a North Korean leader celebrated in Singapur on 12 June when Kim was compromised to the "denuclearization" of the Peninsula of Korea" while Trump was guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang first must deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"United States are in the "denuclearization first" and increases pressure through sanctions to get their coercitive objective, and even against the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The understanding that sanctions can make us a joining is an impossible dream, for who doesn't know us.
But the problem is that the continuous sanctions agudate our unbelief."
Ri noted the plans for the second end between Kim and Trump that the United States leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of week.
However, he spoke about three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the other part of this denuclearisation was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a dead point."
Even so, the ton of Ri's talk was radically different from the past year, when he said to the General Assembly of the United Nations, it was inevitable to attack the United States with northern missiles after that the "mal president" Trump called Kim "home fought in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, that the year past he threatened with "Destruction completely" north Korea, he eloquiated Kim by his power to take measures to disarma him, but he said that there is still a lot of work for doing and that sanctions should be held until the North Korea is denuclear.
The Trump mercury said that there was no time for that, and that "and it's two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the United Nations Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, the younger of the Secretary-General of the United States, Mike Pompeo, said to the United Nations Security Council: "The fulfilment of the Safety Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the total, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in trying to cut down the funds for nuclear programmes and balistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo meetings with Ri at the marge of the United Nations General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang the next month to prepare a second sume.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip wasn't good.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that he had been advanced, only a few hours of the North Korea was declared to make him "maffious questions."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a use of missiles, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the corresponding "medies".
Significantly, Kim told you that the corresponding "medies" that asked were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapur and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students do a course about how to rest enough
This year, a new course of Harvard University is doing that all your students sleep more in order to fight the growth of the machinery culture of study all night stimulated by cafeine.
One academic discovered that students of university number one of the world often don't know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a doctor of sound medicine in Harvard Medicine School and a specialist in Brigham and Muller's Hospital, conceived the course, who thinks it is the first of this type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a call on the impact that the missing sound had in the learning.
"In the end of the course, she got a girl and said to me, 'Why just tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said nobody had talked to him about the importance of sleeping, what was surprised to me," said the The Telegraph.
The course, which started this year first, explains to students the basic aspects of how to buy a good sound habits helping with academic and atletic reward, as well as improves the general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric school of Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a important missing of sound during the week.
The course of a duration is an interactive number of tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dream, where students click on coffee, cortinas, teachers and books to get information about the effects of the cafe and light and how the sound deficit affects the atletic arrangement, as well as the importance of have a rutin at the time to dance.
Another section, infringing the participants as long-term sounds can increase the risk of heart attacks, we will disappear cerebral, depression and cancer.
A map of the camps with interactive icons animate participants to think about their day routine.
"We know it will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we believe you have the right to know these information, as we have the right to know who are the effects of health if we're able to fum tabaco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the honour to pass throughout the night still exists, and adds that modern technology and pressure every time greater for students that implied the missing sound was a growing problem.
To ensure that he sleeps enough and that he has a good quality sound must be the "secrete weapons" of a student to fight the stress, the challenge and anxiety, check it. Even if it does not want to worry, because the missing sound makes the brain between inauguration mode, what makes him hate constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-year-old californian who studied chemical and physical biologist, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after he had assisted one of his classs last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to impulse a course in all the campus.
The next step, waiting, is to request all postgree students to complete a similar study program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to consider the option of establishing an alarm to decline, as well as when they wake up. So it is recommended that they are conscious of the noble effects of the "Blue light" which eject the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disquilib the ritmo around day and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the Menga gol destroyed the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another serious episode when Dolly Menga attacked the disarticulated team from Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 shooting in Livingston.
The Ibrox team tried to register her first victory from the trinf of 4-1 in February in St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team was the second destruction of Gerrard in 18 games as a dealer, which left his team to eight points of the Hearts, Leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Liga is schooling.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the rest and a alignment of the Rangers with a little inspiration never gave the feeling that it was empathy.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place and just behind Hibernian with a difference gol.
And I could be very worse for the Rangers after the Court of Calum Spence had to be treated by a worried in his head to take it suspectly launching a object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that raised the Ayr in the seeds of Bethfred Cup, the Cope of Liga.
On the other hand, Holt was the same 11 of Livingston who took him a point to Hearts last week and would have been happy in the way his organization together suspected his opponents at all moment.
It's possible that the Rangers dominate the possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the balon.
They could have marked only two minutes when the short pass of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor, but the center campaign disappeared this great opportunity.
A powerful shoot from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halckett, but his partner of defense, Alan Lithgow, just got a cravail on the second pair.
The Rangers took the control, but they seemed to have more hope than convinced their game in the delicious area.
Unbelievers, Alfredo Morelos felt that they had to be punished at 15 minutes when Steven Lawless and he and the Arbitre, Steven Thomson, ignored the campaign's reclamations.
The Rangers only carried out two shoes to the door in the first half, but the old guarder of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the attack of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livingston's opening at 34 minutes could have gone against the logic of the game, nobody can deny that they would pay it for his hard work.
Rangers again failed to face the strong training of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher packed the balon for Scott Robinson, who held the cold blood to choose Menga for a single end.
Gerrard acted in the rest when he changed Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, changed that almost had an immediate effect when the whistle made a pass to Morelos, but the impotent Kelly fell from his line to lock it.
But Livingston continued to eat the visitors in playing exactly the type of game you like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ballon after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor was perfectly excited to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow gets out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, called another penalty to join Jacobs, but Thomson's review again.
Almanique: the Geiger counter inventor
And now a page of our almanish "Sunday Morning": on September 30, 1882, he's 136 years ago, and CONTADA... was the day when he was born the physical future John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an inventor that finally brought him to the device known as Geiger account.
A few of the sciences since then, the Geiger counter also became a fundamental element of the pop culture, such as in the film of 1950 "Bells of Coronado" ("The Colonada campaigns"), protagonized by those vacuum scientists appearing insolent Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home, "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as the urini.
When these auriculars are able to listen to the effects of the atoms emissioned by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans, "Say, you're sure you're staying now!"

The new vaccine against the cancer can teach the immunoloxic system to "see" defectuous cells and malles
Vaccine teaches the immunoloxic system to recognize defect cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to several types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing prometers results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immunoloxic system to recognize the defect cells, saw her cancer of vaccine for over 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, which are changed in the lab, so that they can "see" a common protein to several types of cancer called HER2 and then refuse the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancro Institute of the United States of Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promised vaccine."
HER2 "impulss the growth of various cancer types", including mother, birds, pulmón and colorrectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.

Kanye West was in a conversation for Trump when using a MAGA chapter (Make America Great Ree), his appearance in the Saturday Night Live program (SNL).
And the result wasn't good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they supported Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he elected the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that it would be a candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town (Ghost Town), in which he took a gorge of Make America Great Again, criticed the demokrates and repeated his support to Trump.
"I'm talking many times with a white and say, "How can you like Trump if it's racist?"
If I was worried about the racism, I would have gone out of the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL started the program with a protagonized satellite by Matt Damon, where the star of Hollywood was broken from the witness of Brett Kavanaugh before the Junior Committee of the United States Senate on the requests of sexual agreement made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't emited, Chris Rock raised the images of West's criticism to social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to burn himself from West with this publication.
Moreover, Western wanted to hear that he had passed a bad moment in the bathrooms because of his hair.
"It's gone with me in the bathrooms.
They said, "Don't go out with that chapter."
We're intimidated!
And then they said I was going to pick up," she said by Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick up?" saying, "I'll use my superman's hair, why does it mean you can't tell me what I have to do." You want the world to go forward?
Test with love."
His comments caused appropriations in audience at least two times and the members of the SNL list seemed to be confused, reported to the Varety magazine, with the following witness that a person who was there gave the publication: "All study remained in absolute silence."
They were called West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, Mac Miller race, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I love it ("Scan me"), clothed as a Perrier water bottle.
West obtained the support of the TPUSA conservator group, Candace Turner, who wrote the following twitter: "For one of the most strongest spirits: GRAZAS FOR FACER FRONTE A MAFIA"
However, the representative of a interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a twice saying that West was just "self who is and that is completely wonderful."
"So and all, I chose NON to recompense anybody (including his music or clothing or supporting his "Arte") that I think you're cutting and spreading an idea that is prejudicial for my community.
It's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the spektrum, the racist announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was "the being officially known as Kanye West."
It's not the first artist that changes his name; follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rape named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last song of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist first known as Prince.

HIV/AIDS: China reports a increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or Side.
In effect over 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities declared.
40,000 new cases were notified only in the second trimester of 2018.
The majority of new cases has been transmitted sexually, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, the HIV propagated rapidly by some parts of China as the result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of persons that contrary to HIV in this case had been practically reduced to zero, confirmed the Chinese health authorities in a conference in the provincies of Yunnan.
However, in international terms, the number of people who live with HIV or in China increased in 100,000.
HIV sexual transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
The homosexuality was discriminated in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against people LGBT has been exceeded.
Because of the preservative values of the country, studies estimate that between a 70 and a 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will be married with women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease provide inadequate sexual protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Government of China promised the universal access to HIV mediation as part of a effort to face the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a person's member filters data from the Senators of the Republic Partie, "risk lies" and "conspiratory theory"
The Sunday, the representative of the United States, Maxine Waters, announced the accusations that a member of his personnel had been published by three Senators of the United States Republic Party on the pages of Wikipedia of the Lexislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat stated that the statements were made by web sites and comments of the "altre-right".
"Monters, lies and more lying," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Secondly, the distributed information included special addresses and telephone numbers of the American Lindsey Graham Senators, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on line the young man, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the seat of the Government of the United States, during a hearing of the Senate panel on unappropriate sexual conduct accusations against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filter appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and showed the information of a member of the Waters personnel, communicated Capitol Hill.
"This infunded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my personal, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as the result of these false and fraud accusations, was not responsible for any way of filtering these information.
This infunded accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The immediate Waters' declaration has submitted critics on line, including the old Secretary of Press of the White House, Ari Fleicher.
"This dismissed has been mistaken," wrote Fleecher.
"You will understand that you don't have temperation to be member of the Congress.
When they accused someone of something that he didn't do, he doesn't have to hurt himself.
You don't need to show disafiant.
You don't need to ask the reasons of the accuser.
He must stay awful and serenity."
It seemed that Fleicher was comparing the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democratic Democratics of Juiz Kavanaugh, where the critics accused to look too confused during the hearing of the young people.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presented to disappear Waters in the middle-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"My strong if it was true," shared now twice.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the entities undertaken of the compliance of the law and authorities appropried of these fraudulent accusations.
"We're sure to discover the guilty," continued, "as as they consider legally responsible for all their actions that are destroyers and dangerous for all and every member of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: again in action), Rowan Atkinson's dream without power
It is traditionally traditional to find Brexit's transcendance in new films from a British view point, and it seems that it can be applied to the return of the French of this parodia and commission of Johnny English action, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Would the satellite ironics be converted on the matter of clearly stupid that we are in the new opportunity of exporting from the nation?
In any way, the incompetent person of salton eyes and face of Johnny English renewed his license to break the things on the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-Anglophone cinefils territory.
Of course, it's the secret agent that, although its streams of a fuel glass, there's a little Clouseau, a kid of Mr. Bean, and a little guy of that type who contributed with a single note on the subject of fire Cars in the opening of the olympians of London 2012.
It also is also based on the originally based on the international cosmopolit and mysterious agent that Atkinson interpreted once in the forgotten television announces of Barclaycard, in which he seemed the caos to his step.
There's a couple of good moments in the last out of Johnny English.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval armor traxe and the rotor's steps make a short stretch against his box.
The donation of Atkinson for the physical coma goes to the vision, but gives the impression that the humor has a little strength and is a strange superflue, especially when this kind of movies "series" like 007 and Mission Imposible, they already use the coma convincently as one of their ingredients.
It seems like if the humor had been guided to children instead of adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant accidents are not so generous or concentrated as the movies of Atkinson's changed film chistes when they explore Bean's personality.
Now the constantly topic argument is that Great Britain has serious problems.
A cibernetic pirate is infected on the network of supersecret web spees of Great Britain and shows identities of all the British agencies in the area, for the angry of the agent who is in service, a small defortable role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the colm for a first pompous and conflict minister, which has already suffered a total crisis of political impolarity: Emma Thompson gives the best of you with this personage that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
His intelligence advisers that as all the inactive spies were comprometed, they should cut out someone from the retreat.
And this is referring to the uncompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classs about how to convert to an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some chistes, when English offers academy of spies to a rock school.
They bring the English back to Whitehall to an emergency information session and gather with her old and suffered companion Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin's errors of the Secret Service of Your Majesty's Secret Service return to the action, with the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
As soon as the first minister is sucumbering dangerously at the love of the multimillionary multimillionary carism that says that you can resolve the British computer problems: the only Jason Volta, interpretated by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odios of ridicules: challenges of companions, take light to a honourable French restaurant; create a tumult that makes them illegally at the border of Volta's luxury; and English causes the total anarchy when trying to use some virtual real boxs to know themselves with the house of Volta.
Of course, all arrests are out of this last sequence, but from the loving and scandeous way that is, it seems to be removed from a child TV program.
The result is absolutely regular.
And, as happened with the other films of Johnny English, couldn't they prevent thinking: British cinematographic industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Laborist Party refuses to design a plan to work for the British four days a week, but they cover five days
The Laboratory Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days for week, but they cover for five
In particular, the party wants the companies to pass through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers offering them a more free day.
Thus, the employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would continue to get the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would be "assigned" to the economic agenda of the party and its plans to incline the country to the workers.
The Congress of Syndicates supported the four days to week as a measure for workers to use the changed economy.
A major source of the Laboratory Partie told the Sunday Times: "Speakes to announce a review of the policies before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from the day to night, but a working week of four days is a ambition that is adapted to the motion of the party to balance the economy for the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Laborist Party would not be the first in supporting such ideas, since the Green Partie promised a four-day work week during his campaign for the general elections of 2017.
So and all, currently, the Laboratory Partie doesn't support ambition in its totality.
A portrait of the Labour Partie said, "A four-day work week does not enter the party policy and is not considered by this."
The chanceler in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Conference of the Laborist Party last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to recover the power of the "anonymous directors" and "specific" in public services.
The chanceler plans in the shadow also implied the possibility that the current activists of the water companies don't get all their investment, because a laborist government could do "deductions" because of the comprehensive irregularities.
He also confirmed the plans to put workers in the companies' advice and to create inclusive property funds to provide 10% of the actions of the private sector to the employees, which are embolished by an annual divided by a value of up to 500 £.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy count the "60 minutes" if the FBI research about Kavanaugh could make them change of opinion.
The FBI investigation on accusations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh was late a week at least the final vote on its name to the Supreme Court. The question is about whether the department's discoverys could influence the republican senators to retreat him their support.
The Sunday, in the emission of an interview, the reporter of "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republic Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring them to change the opinion.
Kennedy showed more open than his south Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I'm talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I'm calling after he went out of the accusation and ask him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, rounding."
However, Graham's vote seems inadequable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make a explosive accusation," said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett's a round-- added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people who mentioned couldn't check it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will collect the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star cart that they acted and an mission also impressively, to end with the world's poverty.

But what is the rate of success from Global Citizen to 12 years to get its target?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a generic way to persuade people to ask them to take measures or is only another case of the named "Cliticism", people who think that the differences mark when signing a request on line or sending a twitter?
From 2011, Global City says that he registered more than 19 million "actions" of his followers, impulsing a conjunction of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped to stimulate the world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to $37 million to influence over 2250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announces from its actions, from which at least 10 million dollars have already been disappeared or recalled.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds had a direct impact in about 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition (The power of nutrition), a company of investors and executors of the United Kingdom, which has been committed to "assistance to children to develop to their maximum potential", with the promise of offering Ruanda 35 million dollars to help finish with disnutrition in the country after getting more than 4700 tonnes of Global Citizen.
"What support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the donants, the national authorities and the sympathistics of Global citozens as you, we can convert the social injustice of disnutrition into a note of the page of the history," said to the multitude the embaixer of The Power of Nutrition, Trace Ullman, during a direct concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were done for the improvement of the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the Government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will come to 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequency questions on your website, "What do you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen stated: "I'll be a long and hard path and sometimes we'll fall and fall.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and for the citizen rights that are before us, we'll get it, because together, we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will act in the event of this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the sea to make a "bloke" to difficult the Russian energy exports, announced the Secretary-General of Interior of the United States
"In case it is necessary," Washington may turn to the sea to prevent that Russian energy comes to the markets, including the Middle East, declared the Secretary-General of Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to the statement of Washington Examiner.
Zinke concluded that Russia's commitment in Syria, especially where the legislative government's institutions worked, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the energy of the same way they have done it in East Europe," said he, according to it is reported.
Also, according to the official, they have the forms and media to face it.
"The United States have the capacity, together with the sea, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if it is necessary, lock them to ensure that their energy is not going to the market," said he.
Zinke guides the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is called himself as the "voce of energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to handle Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, he turned the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to use and replace the combustibles," commented, at the same time, when Russia refered to, saying, "It's only a tactic" with a dependent economy of hydrocarbons.
The declarations were realized while Trump's administration was in a mission to impulse exports from its natural gas liquid to Europe, to replace Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
For this end, the Trump's administration officials, including the own president, tried to persecute Germany to remove from the "indecued" project of North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, converted to Berlin to "cative" from Moscow."
Moscow repeatedly recalled that the North Stream's oil of 2 of 11 million dollars, which was established to double the capacity of existing oiloduto to 110 million cubic meters, is a better economic project.
Kremlin argued that the defense of Washington's position to the project is only argumented for economic reasons and that it is an example of illegal competence.
"I believe we share the idea that the energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the providers," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, with the meeting with the Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, which had been located in September in Moscow.
The posturation of the United States obtained German reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leader organization of the sector, the Federation of German Industry (BDI, by its cigarettes in Germany), added to the United States to abuse the EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interfers in our energy offer," said Dieter Kempf, President of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German chance, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.

The U.S. Embassor accuses China to exercise abuses with "propagandistic advice"
One week after a Chinese official period published an announcement of four pages in the United States in the United States by requesting the benefits of the trade between the United States and China, the United States embatterery in China accuses Peking to serve the North American pressure to diffusion propaganda.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, refered to the supply of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold period of Iowa state, after accusing China to interfere in the elections to the United States Congress, which will be celebrated on 6 November, since China denied.
Trump's accusation that Peking was trying to interact in the United States elections, he framed what the officers of that country acquired in Reuters as a new phase of a growing campaign in Washington to cooperate with China.
Although it is normal that stranger governments publish an announcement to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently attacked in a growing trade war testifying the level of arance in their respective imports.
According to the experts of China and the United States, China's compensors at the beginning of the trade war were designed to predict States exporters such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republic Party.
Terry Brandstad, the United States embasseur in China and Iowa officer, one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, stated that Pekin predicted the workers, the guaranteers and the North American businessers.
In the opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Monines Register's editing Sunday, it is expressed that China's "increasing this axis campaign to divorce propagandistic announces in the free US press."
"In the diffusion of his propaganda, the Chinese government was used by the appreciated north American freedom of expression and pressure when publishing a pay announcement in the Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the place of periods located at the end of this street of Peking, they are little to disident voices, and there is no real reflection of the shooting opinions that Chineses can have about the economic trafficking in China, because the communication media are under the firm polar of the Chinese Communist Party," adds.
So, she says that "the one of the most important periods of China declared the offer to publish" his article, although he didn't confirm that the period is going to be.

"These things can't be cancelled," ensures Grant Reeher, a teacher of political sciences in the Maxwell University of Syracuse in a article published on the Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for a FBI research was enough to calm the souls of the famous votants.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, as well as they don't forget him in a future nearby nor in November," thought Karine Jean-Pierre's grandmaster and national advisor of the Progressist Group MoveOn, in Washington's journal, D.C.
The Venezuela on the morning, the opositorys, at the "November Acercase" grip, were manifested in the front of the Senate, while the Republicans, with the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to continue before the name of Kavanaugh, although the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, informed Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democratics will exceed any expectation," ensures Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analysis.
"It's sure he's high,
But it's still going to be more, in particular among the indecisive women of the barriers in the forests or those who have between 18 and 29 years, which still doesn't like the President, they don't advise urnes."
Before the public witness of Ford detailed their sexual accusations against the candidates of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans followed before the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster to the Republic Partie," stated Michael Steele, representative of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of week in the NBC News channel.
"This is more than the committee voting, the final vote or if Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans and how they have treated it" said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the election of the Democratics in the news channel.
However, it seems that the United States are divided between which they believe the witness of Ford or Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support this last.
A new research of YouGov shows that a 41% of the inquired persons believes totally or probably the Ford's witness, before 35% that supports Kavanaugh's witness.
Furthermore, a 38% believes that the most probable is that Kavanaugh lies during his witness, before a 30% who thinks the same Ford.
With the pressure executed by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations present by Ford, as well as at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
The past week, Ford tested before the Junior Committee of the Senate under the jury that Kavanaugh attacked in a branch state when he was 17 years old.
In contrast, Ramirez suggests that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him the genetics in a university party when this study was in Yale in 80.
The World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to competite with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launchs a startup to competite with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology lead, is a company based on Solid, the open code platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people can access what information.
In a exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee had hoped that the intention that hide Inrupt is "domine the world."
"We have to do this," said he about startup.
"This is a story moment."
Application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store" or POD.
Lists of contacts, tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available at the same time.
All this makes this personal data storage is that the user has a full control on whom you can access any information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal emergency through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to his President John Bruce, is that the company supports resources, processes and ability to help which Solid is available for all the world.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company of IBM, some contracted developers to work in the project and a community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, developers of all the world could create their own applications decentralized with the available tools on Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee said that no one or his team talked with "Facebook nor with Google about entering or not a complete change that would change his business models one day to another.
"We don't need your permission."
In the article published the Saturday in Media, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and a ecosystem that helps protect integrity and quality of a new web based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community in the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
In the past months, Berners-Lee was exhausted as a voice influenced in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimist with this new was from the web," added Berners-Lee.

The only Church of England, which was condemned with the Victoria Cruz during the First World War, received a poor homenaxe in his birth city 100 years later.
The counsel leader and revering Bernard Vann was galled on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.

More later he was pressed to come to the fire line, and, with a "gran validity," he directed the line before precipite himself with a canon and without help of no one, and threw out the three people of the enemy destacting.
Commander Vann was murdered by a German francotirer on October 4 of 1918, just a month before the war was finished.

"Pepa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, stated that they would take account of the United Kingdom Experts in future programmes.
"I think we can solve when we think about the repetition," said Coker.
"But if they are the six of the morning there, we can't solve until the Sunday, that's going to be lunch for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change was produced, I started getting a lot of messages and not all were happy.
We were trying to try a solution because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a governmental problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll be limited to five lots, instead of six. We wanted to give the maximum to our employees, but we're past and
We have a lot of robbers."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt low because of his sexuality

Invited the first emission of the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 leadered by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexual to give hope to others.
He also shared that the fact that he was a father helped him to relate the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the normal presentator of this program, is low by sickness.
As a invitation of the first program leadered by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "not was socially acceptable that they like the children and the children."
So he said, "Today, that feeling of lowerness and being different is what he impulsed me and gave me the needful strength to get success."
I wanted to prove that it was "how" that people wouldn't feel deceived when they discover their sexuality.
With two olympical olympical medals, it was converted into a destacted LGBT activist and used its appearance in the Commonwealth games of Australia to ask more countries to dispensate homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt happy to live openly and without fear of influences, and wanted to give hope to others.

"But now I know there's much more important things than a Golden Olympic Medalla.
For me, my medalla is Robbie."

"In this time I knew that this was the dream of my life: to steal against a multitude in my country participating in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling."
The choice of the Proud of Heather Small song is not gone, because it's the melodie that he's with him during his preparation for the Olimpides and still put him the pools.

A Mickelson lowly ended in the Ryder Cup bank this Sabbath
The US Phil Mickelson will buy a record on Sunday when he plays your 47th party of Ryder Cup, but he must improve your technology so that this would not be converted into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the welfare event for 12 times, was in the bank by the decision of the Captain Jim Furyk and could not participate in the fireball or in the Saturday quarters.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times to the United States, the five times the campion passed the day in animating and working to improve its movements.
Although it was never the most precious of the players, nor even at the moment of his carrying, for their 48 years doesn't belong in the corrected field Le Golf National, where the higher herb punished the wrong shoes.
And if it wasn't enough, Mickelson turned up on the ninth party of the Sunday to Francesco Molinari, the British Open winner, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parts of this week.
If the United States, four points below at the beginning of the 12 individual parties, they start with good feet, Mickelson's action could be totally critical.
Furyk trusted his man, although he couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfection the role that he worked today, threw a palm in the shadow, passed my arm and told me that it would be ready tomorrow," shared Furyk.
"I trusted completely in himself.
He's a location in the Fame room and brought much to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I thought I would play more, but at the end so they are things and so we thought they should be.
Like everyone, he wants to be out there."
The Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
I could mark the end of her carrier at Ryder Cup, the carrier that never came to the level of your individual palmari.
Mickelson counts 18 victories, 20 destroys and seven halfs, although Furyk says that his presence also provides intaxible to the team.
"It's a funny, sarcastic person, with an engeny and likes to go with people, it's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see the good that happened the youngest players with him this week.
It's much more with a good player."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappointment of the vantaxe
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in the last individual day of Ryder Cup can be easily converted into an income trip.
The Great Danish started in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesters had five points of vantage on the United States, but finally arrived to the meta line with a minimum vantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great vantage in Valderrama; as in Brooklyn, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won a little," considered Bjorn, on the photo, after seeing the promotion of 2018 wins 5-3 wines and yesterday, 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story shows that this hasn't been done yet.
Tomorrow, we have to go for everything.
You have to go out and do the right.
This is not finished until the points are in the bookmark.
Our objective is to win that trofeo, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not going to say it, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but they're too very conscious of what's on the other side: the best players of the world."
Happy with his player's work in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before.
We're going to face the other beast tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to show our validity.
It's amazing to be with a partner on the side when things are good, but when you're looking at individual things, then makes the test of your capacity as golfist.
This is the message you need to transmit to the players, who take the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner back, and he also needs to take the best of himself."
The difference of Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek that your players have a better individual work than with their companies, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points of four points.
Furyk himself was in the areas of two extremes of these rays of the last day, being part of the gainer team in Brooklyn, but finishing as a loss to take the European Migration to Mednah."
"I remember each of the crazy words," he answered when he was asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, gathered the face players at the last day.
"We have 12 important parts, but you want to have a fast start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see that the impulse goes into a direction, there's a lot of pressure in the middle parts.
We're preparing our aliance by having this in account and put the players as it seemed to us, we want to make maxis tomorrow."
Thomas has the task to try to lead the fight and to face Rory McIlroy on the first party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, on the top half of the classification.
"I decided this order because I think I'm covering all the way," explained Bjorn about his choice for individuals.
The new war ship in Germany is once again
The newest fragate of the German Army should be delivered in 2014, to replace the old war ships of the Friday war, but it will not come to at least the next year because of defectious systems and the cost every time greater, they reported the local media.
The ship in service of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leader of the flaming fragates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was advised to the first semester of 2019, according to a military portrait to the Day Zeit.
The ship should be incorporated to the Marine in 2014, but the following problems on the delivery affected the destination of this ambitious project.
The four ships of Baden-Württemberg, which Armada carried in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class fragments.
It is understood that they will count with a powerful canon, with various anti-electric and anti-buck mixers, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radio, infrared and accustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to distract the newest fragments until two years out of the origin ports.
However, as well advertising Day Time, these continuous travels mean that war ships with the last technology, and that will allow Germany to proceed their power in the stranger, they will be old when they enter into service.
The ungraced F125 fragate was noticed last year, when the German Armada was officially committed to commission the ship and returned to the town Blohm & Yous in Hamburg.
It was the first time Marina returned a ship to a buyer after the delivery.
It was little known about reasons behind this devolution, but the German communication media talked about "creaty effects on software and hardware" which imposed the use of war ship in a war mission.
The software defects were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are operated by a 120-marine tripulation; it means, the half of the personal needed in the old Bremen class fragments.
Furthermore, it discovered that the ship had an excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its employment and limits the capacity of the Sea to add better in the future.
It is considered that Rheinland-Pfalz of 7000 tonnes is the double that the similar class ships used Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total price of the project, including the training training, is also converting into a problem.
It is stated that it has already reached the absurd import of 3300 million euros in the front of 2200 million initiatives.
The problems of the most recent fragments are particularly important to the light of the recent warnings that the power of Germany makes water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, he recognized that Marina remains without such boats to disappoint.
The officer says that this problem is always greater, because the old ships were removed, but not replaced by others.
So, he was sorry that no one of the fragates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be joined to Marina.
National Trust speechs the secret life of the bowls
A new research that is carried out in a field of highlands in Scotland is trying to declare how the bottles use the parents to find food.
It is hoped that the results arise light on the behavior of these unique flyers and help guide the future conservation activities.
This study leadered by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording teams are placed in key locations around the property to follow the track activities during the time.
The NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile reviews with manual detectors.
A sound analysis conducted by experts of all records will determine the frequency of the calls of the tracks and which is doing every kind.
Then, you will be developed a hazard map to create a detailed image to the scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, adviser of NTS Nature Conservation, expects that the results show that the areas of the village are more important for the tracks and how they use each of the species.
This information will help us to determine the benefits of the employment management work, such as the creation of plants, and which is the best way to maintain the forests for the woods and other associated species.
Populations in Scotland and all the United Kingdom have decreased considerablely in the last century.
These animals are threatened by building and development works that affect the children and the loss of worst.
Airgenerators and the alumerated also suffer a risk, as well as tramps with pigment for muscles, some chemical treatment of construction materials and home cats attacks.
The skins are not blind,
But because of their night-sheet grounds, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the time of falling.
They use an ecolocalisation technical sophisticated to find insects and obstacles in their air traffic.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 history buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares in all the country, is very serious to the branches.
Account with ten formed experts, which periodically reviews, children inspections and, in times, even rescue.
The organization even includes the only and the first reservation of Scozia shops in Threave State in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the fire of eight of the ten species of Scotland.
David Thompson, manager of State, says that this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave, we have a great area for bottles," says.
"We talk to old buildings, history trees and a wonderful habitat.
But it's a lot of things we don't even know about the bottoms, so the work we're taking up here and other properties will help us to understand better what they need to prosper."
Destays the importance of controling the presence of tracks before doing maintenance tasks in properties, because it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single child of maternity can kill until 400 women and crews, which could extermine all a local population.
The skins are a protexed species and is illegal to kill them, acouss them or mockles, as well as destroying their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"Anyway, it's too much to learn about the tracks and, in the case of many species, we don't know how he's going to his populations."

Christian Ronaldo qualifies the violation denunciations in their contrast as falsehoods, assuring that the only one who wants people is to be known using their name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these accusations.
Portuguese and Juventus was accused to violate Kathryn Mayorga, a United States woman, in the hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Although the footballist paid the woman 375,000 USD to not say anything about the accident, Der Spiegel published the venes.

The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would ask an indemnation by "moral donations for a respective import to the gravity of the infraction, which is probably one of the most serious infractions of the personal rights of the last years."
The suspect incident would have occurred in June 2019, on a sequence of Palm Hotel and Casino de Las Vegas.
After being known in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the room of the player, where presumptually violated it annually, according to the documents presented in the District Court of Clark of Nevada.

Breach: Automatic manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would laugh forever to the loss of its place as a world-wide car producer by Brexit, according to the Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
It added that it was worried that Toyota UK confirmed in the BBC that if Great Britain left the EU without a agreement, it would temporarily disappear the production of her Burnaston fabric, near Derby.
"It's necessary to come to a agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that, in the case of Brexit does not get any agreement, the impact of the tracks at the border could cost work positions.
Burnaston's plant, maintained by the production of Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced in the past year $1500,000 vehicles, from which an export was 90 % to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Great Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how the production is stopped in our fabric," declared Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automobil producers of the United Kingdom also expressed their fear for the department of the EU without a agreement on the operation of trade between borders, between Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close your Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of automobile manufacturers is the risk of the administrative chain in case it is not at Brexit's agreement.
Toyota's production line is very adjusted, each 37 minutes will be part of the United Kingdom providers and the EU for automobiles made at measure.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a agreement, the border could be affected and could be generated behind and loss of pieces.
The company says that it would be impossible that Toyota keeps a normal ritm more than one day in the derbyshire plant, so the production should be stopped.
Clark claims that the Chequers of Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated with precision to prevent these conflicts in the border".
"It's essential to have a agreement, and we want to be the best agreement, so to enjoy the current success, but also to apply this opportunity" said in the Today BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent subminister strings."
Toyota could not love how long the production would stop, but he warned that the added costs would reduce the competence of the plant and could even costs of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, employed by Burnston for 24 years and the Sindica Coordinator of the Unit, said that his members are always more worried: "For experience, I know that when these works are lost, they will never return.
A portrait of the Government stated that they presented a necessary and critical plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be replaced again
The White House stated that the high risk meeting of Donald Trump and the subsecret of justice Rosenstein could be late a week more for the fight by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein surveys the work of the special lawyer Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russian and Trump assistance, and the potential obstruction to justice by the president.
Just as Trump disappears the general fiscal, as if you don't do it, what would be in danger of the independence of Mueller, eat the rumers in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke to use a microphone to save conversations with Trump and the possibility to replace the President through 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last month, he accused the White House, between reports that indicated that I was the pick of dimitting.
However, she announced a meeting with Trump, who was found in New York, the young one.
Trump said that he would prefer not to leave Rosenstein, but the meeting was left to prevent a shock with the audience of the judicial committee of the Senate in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of unjust sexual conduct.
The wedding, Trump ordered an investigation for a week to the FBI about the statements against Kavanaugh, which still left the vote in the Senado.
Sarah Sanders, the Trump Press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Before the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, "No longer there's a fixed date, it might be this week or a week later, given all that's going to happen in the high court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press is informed."
Some journalists asked that statement, because Sanders takes from 10 September without celebrating a pressur round.
When the representative Chris Wallace asked her why,
Sanders said that the failure of information session was not due to an advance to the biggest of the reporters, although he added that it would not be who does not reject that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President allows more interviews than the previous President," he said, although he didn't quote any source to open these data.
They will continue to celebrate information meetings, said Sanders, but he insisted that "if the pressure has the opportunity to ask you directly to the President of the United States, that is much better to guide the questions to her.
You are witnesses of how we take this in the last weeks, and this will replace a pressur role where you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump has been able to answer questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors dictators.
However, press conferences in solitary are exhausted.
Maybe the President showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and strange events before the journalists gathered.

That is why I want to repeat how much value the contribution of each member of the personnel, independently of its nationality.
The companies of the European Union and more there have an insectable experience and capacity that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities to which we serve.
The school is your fire, and we want you to stay here with us."

The increase of the tax payment is applied to people and enterprises who don't pay imposes in the United Kingdom, and the reserved money will serve to support the campaign of the Government to reduce the number of people who sleep in the street.
The recycling, which is added to the current timber investment, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second lives and the buys to buy, may be at 3 %.
Facenda expects that the changes can take up to 120 million libres per year.
Nearly 13% of the new constructions made in London are marketed by non-habitants in the United Kingdom, which causes a increase of prices and difficulty that people who want to buy first a lived have more difficult to access the immobilier market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in capital, were converted to "pantasma cities" because of the high number of strangers who passed most of their time out of the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson is requested to apply a recurrence in the market transfer to help new people to buy his first house.
He accused great buildings to keep the prices of high lives by buying soil and not use of this, and encouraged Mrs. May to remove the percentage of fishing income on the moderate prices houses to arrange the "burn of the lives sector" which lives in the British.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals in relation to the living, including the control of others and the prohibition of disafiances in which the inquiry does not have sin.
He also wants to guarantee the greatest powerful concils at the time of building new lives.
Ms. May said, "The year past I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: that life should be better for each new generation.
And for this, it is necessary to arrange the disastrous market of life.
Great Britain will always be open to what he wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not just that it results like simply for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based on strangers, live markets as for British Works.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a living lives is too far, and the independence that supposes not to have a tea continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is able to advise the Scotland."
The chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, declared that his "the last ambition" is to be converted to the Scotland electorer at some time.
This school of 42 years is enjoying the disaster of reviving the north-west club, which currently built the third place in League One, to three points of distance from the head.
He came to the Stadium of Light, after bringing back to St Mirren to the Premiership, he spent the past time.
"When I was a player, my dream was playing for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and it was all," said Ross to the Sportsound program of the BBC School.
"I thought I saw playing the Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when he was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I have successfully guided a club."
between Ross' frontiers in the Sunderland Advocaat, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The previous age of Alloa Athletic says that you didn't feel worried about these so consolidated figures in a big club after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"The success for me will depend on this moment if I can return this club to Premier League?
Because the structure and the installations of the club are unbelievablely owned by a Club of Premier League," he said.
"I'm not gonna get a simple task to come, but it's probably that you're just thinking that I'm successful here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross only takes three years as a adestrator after a dumbarton assistance period and a period of 15 months within the Hearts technical personnel.
At that period, Aloa helped Aloa to get back from the descense to the third division and made St Mirren to be the picks of descending to win the title of Championship at the next time.
Ross believes that he feels more comfortable than that he never found during his player carrier in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I probably found me in a real cross", remembered, about to do the Alloa's load.
"I really thought it was perfect for me, even more than to play.
I was amazing because I wasn't bad, I was rarely winning life, and I enjoyed some efforts.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to survive every week.
I continue suffering you in relation to the stresss and the pressure of the work, but to admit me.
I always liked to admit, and now I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

The specialized pubs and bars in drink were the best results obtained with higher consumption increased at the experiencing reductions of restaurants.
The specialised pubs in food also suffered the sun, although not so dramatically as the restaurants operators.

Paul Newman, employed by the RSM analysis of ocean and hospitality activities, stated: "There are the results supposed to continue the tendency that comes from the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and deportive events continue to be the main factors in relation to the consumption outside of the house.
It does not surprise that the restaurants groups continue suffering, however, an annual fall of 4,8% will be especially painful if it adds to you the continuous increase of costs.
The challenge and long see couldn't have arrived in a worst moment for restauration businesses and the time will be the hand to say if the moderation of the experimented temperatures during August will provide the so necessary respiration for the sector."
The total growth of the sales in pubs and restaurants, including new opening, was 2.7% during July, which reflects the disacceleration in the brands launching.

An announcement of a maternal leite extractor in comparison to women with vaccines divided to public opinion on networks
A company of maternal latte extractors divided the public opinion in networks with an announcement compared to lacking mothers with vaccins that are moving.
To announce the launch of the "prime extractor of silent portfolio of the world", Elvie published an ironical announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom that offers the new leet extractor to the mothers.
Four real mothers bailing in the sky full of fee for the eggs at the ritmos of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I'm moving myself, but I don't have cold" and "Why if you don't tell you, they're not ubres, they're my pieces."
The core continues to say, "Muxe, move, I'm eating the babys, moving, moving, I'm moving my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has provoked polemica in the networks.
With 77,000 playings and hundreds of comments, the video offered different reactions between the spectaculars. Many of them said that this point of manifesting the "horrors" of the lacte sector.
"Use vaches to announce this product was a very average decision.
Like us, they need to stay embarrassed and give light to produce lake, but in their case we stole their sons days after giving the light," he wrote one.
Elvie leite extractor can be put into a maternal suits (Elvie/nai)
Another expert commented: "Claramente traumatical for mother and baby.
But if, why don't they use to announce a late extractor for the mothers who stay with their babys?"
Another spectacle added: "What I am preaching with so little tattoo."
Other spectaculars defended the announcement, even a woman said that the song seemed "I'm gracious."
"Let me see that it's a great idea.
If you were still giving the piece, I would buy one.
Get out of my leaf made me feel exactly like a vacuum.
The announce is a little shot, but I'm interpreted as a smile.
It looks like a great product," writes one.
Others commented, "This is a funny announcement guided to the mothers who extract their leite (freely in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "vaces".
This is not an announcement to eloxy or jury the lacte industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women shows that they were bailing with extractors inserted in their followers.
The concept based on the campaign is that many women who extract their latte say they feel like eggs.
Nevertheless, Elvie leet extractor is completely silent, there is no cables or tubes and can be able to cut off a discreet way in a maternal suiter, who gives women freedom to move, suggest their babys and even out there while they're extracting their leaf.
Ana Balarin, a company and the Executive Creative Director of Mother commented: "The extractor Elvie is a so revolutionary product that provides a relief and provoking launch.
When we described the existing parallelisme between women and late vaccines, we wanted to focus on the extraction of late and all the disasters that implied once we demonstrated an intermediate and close to the incrible sense of freedom that offers the new extractor.
It's not the first time the Elvie extractor works the journalists.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures split in the passenger for the designer Marta Jakubowski while he used the product.
Centers of emigrants were silently moved to a campaign in the Texas border
The number of detailed emigrants children increased although the monthly number of cross in the border remained relatively invariable, in part because of the retorical and policy introduced by the Trump administration had difficulty to assign parents to children.
Traditionally, most of the parents were also immigrants without parents and were afraid to put their ability to stay in the country by giving an advanced step to recall a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential parents and other adult members of their chairs would have to send their digital pieces and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high load of the Inmigration Service and Douan Control of the United States, tested before the Congress that the Agency arrested a few persons who asked to be smaller without company.
Afterward, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no penalties.
"Nearly 80% of people who are parents or who are part of the fire of these are attacked in the illegal country, and a large part of these are strangers who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process the children with greater speed, the officers introduced new rules that would require some of these comparisons in the judge before they cross a month from their arrest in place of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the workers of the refugee.
Many will compare through videoconference instead of persons to try to legalize their case against a court of immigration.
Those who do not comply with the requirements to receive aid will be quickly deported.
As long as they remain low keeping, more probabilities will have to be courageous or depressed, which can cause violent rows or trials to escape according to the employers of the refugee and reports of the system published during the last months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in the centres of greater dimensions as the Tornillo, in which there are more possibilities that the symptoms of a child is going to pass in the wrong way, they are disappeared because of its size.
They also added that to move the children to the campaign area without give them enough time to prepare them from the emotional view point or to leave friends could suffer a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the employment forces of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately remove
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem, directing the United Nations General Assembly, also requested Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently attracted in its eighth year.
Mobilem, who also shows the cargo of Vice Prime Minister, declared that strange forces were found in only Syrian illegally, with the pretext of fighting against terrorism, and that they were "searched from them in the occasion of the opportunity."
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism has almost finished" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions of them had to escape from their houses.
He also said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we clean all the Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "on all the strange presence of illegal."
The United States accounts about about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially to advise and assess the core forces and the Arab Syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country destroyed by the war.
On the subject of the refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions were given correctly to their return and were guilty to the "any western countries" of the "difusion of irrational mediums" which caused refugees to not return.
"We return to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," said he.
"They are politics what should be a great humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide aid for the rebuilding for Syria until a political agreement was produced between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomatics claim that the recent agreement agreed between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last great rebellion of Idlib was allowed to continue with the political discussions.
The Agreement between Russia and Turkey has evited a large scale of Syrian troops supported by Russia in the provincies, where three million people lived.
Nevertheless, Moualem raised that the agreement had "date of clear limits" and expressed his hope that military actions had to be destined to the Xhiadists, including the soldiers of the Al-Norra attached to Al-Qaeda, that "they will be unradicated."
The United Nations State of Mistura has the hope of convocating the first meetings of a new committee composed by members of the Government and of the occasion to develop a shop of a poor constitution to Syria and to facilitate the celebration of elections.
Mobilem exposed the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to "Revise the articles of the current constitution" and warned the potential interferences.
Why Trump will win a second mandate?
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would have achieved the election in 2020 to not be that, as many free will be waiting, the emphasis and the scandas will end up to his presidency of pre-determination.
I'm sure that it would be "the most dramatic end of the presidency."
Now there are no signs of chain between observators.
Since 2014, the audience indexs in the first-time multiplyed more than two, until they arrived at 1,05 million spectators in the CNN and almost triplicated until they arrived 1,6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has a average of 2,4 million spectaculars in the first-time, a increase of 1,7 million in respect of four years ago by Nillen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" program of MSNBC leaded the channel audience indexs with 3,5 million spectaculars during the nights that were produced important news.
"It's like a light that touches people because he's trained of something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner from the drama to the ABC "Designed Survivor", which is a secretary of the ministerial branch that turns to the president after a attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veterana writer of comdia and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi travel in Boston before the elections of 2016.
The driver told you that he would vote by Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked him.
"He answered, 'Cause I'm laughing," said Mrs. Scovell.
There is an interaction within the caos.
Of course, in fact, all the other things that are present in the television, the traces that are in Washington are able to determine the future of Roe against Wade case, if emigrant family can be gathered back and the status of the world economy.
Disconnecting the reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can be allowed.
Even so, it is supposed to be more than a citizen informed to pass six hours to see a panel of experts discussing about the use made by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", the whole bomber for the adstructive $15,000 of Paul Manfort ("a full of arrogance," stated Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' scanner descriptions about the atomy of Mr. Trump.
I'm not going to look at Super Mario on the same way.
"The part of what you do can look like a reality show is that you're giving something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, high executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that is about changes in the persons and the journalistic arguments of the show of Trump (the conflict with N.F.L., the eloxys to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't let you lose a episode or stay back.
When I was in contact with Mr. Fleiss this week, I made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house, in the north Coast of Kauai, but I was closed in the house when I saw MSNBC while I recorded the CNN.
It was not able to disappear while Brett Kavanaugh was the point to face the June Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court with a group.
"I remember when we were doing all these programs so stupid in that time and the people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the western civilization," comments Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of dream, but it was that they were right."

The external money comes to measures to finance the candidates in the camera for the elections of half of the reading
It does not surprise that the 17th congressional district of Pennsylvania has received a large floor of money because of the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in functions in the carrier to buy the same place.
This district located in the areas of Pittsburg, which was recently reorganized, is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, which has obtained its other place in a special election celebrated the past primavery.
Lamb is presented against another representative in functions, the Republican Keith Rothfus, which now represents the 12th District of Pensilvania, which is overseased in a large way on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pensilvania determined in January that the Republicans manipulate the electoral circumscription of the old districts to their favor.
The electoral carrier in the new 17th congressional district disappeared a festival of campaign financing between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was converted to a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieved a victory adjusted in the special elections of March to the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide persecution.
That place was occupied by a republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Political experts allow the demokrates a vantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing the Savior by their support to China and then they fell back
Diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking, with a little answer by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a favorite meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and even had a hotel in Panama until his partners bought the driver of the Trump Organization.
Functions of the State Department decided to order back to the United States diplomatic missions of O Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama "for recent decisions to not recognize Taiwán," says Heather Nauert, the department's portfolio in an declaration made this month.
However, only the possibility to apply sanctions against the Salvador, which received approximately 140 million US support during 2017, including to control drugs, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, among which were included in financial assistance and restrictions in view, would be very negative for the Central American country and their high disemployment and murder rates.
While the internal meetings were progressed, the North America and Central American officers had encouraged the celebration of a high-level conference centred in security and economic prosperity to accomplish a similar meeting in the past year, which was considered a step in the efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in the middle of September, important officials of the administration have left clearly that they wanted to advance the conference, finally efficiently make any opportunity to apply sanctions for the Salvador.
It is programmed that Vice-President Mike Pence guides the conference, now programmed for the average of October, in the symptom of the importance that you organize the administration, the diplomatics confirmed.
The three North America's messengers returned directly to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new message or severe punishment from Washington.
A portrait of Mr. Bolton declared to comment the details of the debate, which were described by the three North American officials, including two diplomatics, which accepted to talk about internal deliverations and when the anonim of the participants was held.
His accounts were corrupted by an external analysis near the administration, and he also accepted speaking as long as his anonim was maintained.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report of the special advisor Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction to Mr. Trump's justice, which now exists many evidence in the public archive.
Secondly, Mr. Mueller is also directing his research to find if the campaign of Mr. Trump conspired with Russia in his attack to our elections.
If the Congress has changed hands, Mr. Trump should make accounts in this body, just when you have to prepare for elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very uncognitious and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, as well as his European homologs.
We all have to take decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will affect the battle duration.
In 1938, German officials decided to put a state fight against Hitler if the west front resists and supports checoslovacs in Munich.
We missed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killing that later occurred.
The course of the history turns around these inflation points, and the inexorbable progress of democracy is acceled or backed.
The United States are confronted to several of these inflation points in these moments.
What will we do if Mr. Trump declines the General Fiscal Agreement of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the destination of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took with the water to the fish since this journal reported that, in the past year, he suggested to write in secret to the President and spent that he was incapable to the charge.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that The Times' information is not true.
"How will we answer if the investigation that was just requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or is confirmed by its name to the Supreme Court, although the crisis of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, above all, will we vote in the elections of half of reading by a Congress that takes responsibilities to Mr. Trump?
If we don't exceed these evidence, democracy will be submitted to a long wind.
But I think we're not missing, thanks to the lesson I learned in Praga.
My mother was a checoslovac judge that was brought to Auschwitz on the same nazi rexime that also buyed my house, which was known about the embassed.
He survived, emigrated the United States, and, 60 years later, sent to take Shabat's candle on that table that included a swati.

Rangers Graham Dorrans player shows optimist at the meeting against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna the younger, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impatient impatient in Spain before the Villarreal this month, would put you into a very favorable position to classify in the G group of Europe League.
A lesson in the steel stopped the center campaign Graham Dorrans to build this template until the 2-2 empate before Villarreal, but I think Rangers can use this result as trampolin to get more important things.
"I was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the player of 31 years.
"We're going to the party thinking we can get something positive and get a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general, the empathy is probably a correct result.
Probably they were better during the first half, but in the second floor we were higher.
The next youth will be another big night.
We hope to end up the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have received a good result in their last party, but with support of our public, I'm sure we can fight to get a positive result.
The last year was hard among all that happened with my lesions and changes produced in the team, but there is a great environment in this time.
The team is good, the kids are walking well, and the adestraments are good.
We hope we can fight, forget the past time and have success."
Women preoccupied the worms for their jubilation
Although the fact that the participants in the investigation were clear as they wanted to take them, little people talked to their family about the matter.
Nearly half of the participants in this study made by Nationwide said that they commented with their couples the cost that suspected the long costs.
That's just 10% he said they're talking to their children about the subject.
"The people want to be a family, but they do not take the necessary measures to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Vice-Security Department.
They can start next.
Talk to your couple and children: You can't prepare your family to think if you don't communicate your desires with a lot of prelation.
Work with your advisor and your family to agree where and how to get the respects, because these decisions may be a determinant factor at the time of determineing the cost.
Call your financial advice: Your assistant also can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Interesting financing options of long-term costs are attracted by a traditional prolonged custody security policy, a Hybrid Life Safety Police to help cover these expenditures or self-security covered with your own funds, as long as you are available from the money.
Negate your legal documents: Eject legal wars.
Take a representative of health support to design a confidential person to monitor your medical attention and ensure that professionals do with your desires if you are not able to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a noteal power to manage your financials.
You should choose a confidence person to take financial decisions for you and ensure that your factures are paid if you are incapable.
Don't forget the small details: imagine your father or mother's biggest has a medical emergency and go from the way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
Remember this information with details in a written plan to be ready.

Territory and Tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and a tsunami that affected the Indonesia city of Palu the venes, according to official sources, caused death at least 384 people, a number that expects to continue to increase.
Because of the communications courts, the rescue bodys could not get any information from Donggala region, a area located at the north of Palu, which is closer to the episode of the earthquake of 7,5 degrees of magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after disaster.
Then we facilitate some key data about Palu and Donggala in the Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the provincies of Central Celebes, which is located at the end of a street bath at the west side of Celebes Island, with a nearly 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating her 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami were produced.
Donggala is a restriction that is found by more than 300 km of cost northwest of Celebes Island.
This region, a administrative region was lower than a provincie, counted with a nearby population of 299,200 residents in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pearls of the economy of the Province of Central Celebes, especially in the Coast region of Dongala.
The mines of Niquel are also important in the provincies, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite cost of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala were affected by tsunamis several times during the last 100 years after the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the west part of Donggala in 1996, caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia is attacked on the Cinth of Light Pacific of High Sismical Activity, so he suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis who suffered for the last years:
2004: An important earthquake in the West Coast of the Province of Aceh of Indonesia, north of Sumatra, produced on 26 December, has caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, caused death of 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.

A warner of children in New York asks a couple after a "racist" message
A warning of children in New York will ask a couple for discriminatory discipline after getting a message that wouldn't guide her from the mother in which she was threatened that it was "other black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compare the request with a "extorsion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two sons, showed her affliction when he discovered that the baby Giselle Maurice's career was black when his first day of work was present in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OUTRA NEGRA," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to your husband, she sent me to Ms. Maurice twice.
After recalling his mistake, a "incomoded" Plasco-Flaxman sent to Mrs. Maurice, saying that the warning that was just going, that was African, made her work wrong, and that expected a philpion in accordance with the New York Post announcement.
Ms. Maurice paid her the work day and sent her home to Uber.

"See, I want to show them that these things are not doing," said to the Post the winds, to add later, "It's a case of discrimination."

It's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco husband to Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they offered, although it was because of a mistake?
Your baby's been born?
Come on!"
After comparing the question with a "extorsion", Plasco explained that his wife was just having a baby two months and that he was found in a "satisfactory very difficult."

"It was a silent man and nothing presumptuous," said he.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like you had a son who had something: you're honourable yet you didn't do it really.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little of that way.
Although it was a creation of her and product of his imagination, he always gave him all the merit to his own Paddington."
My daughter was dead and she had to leave me through the phone.
After the aircraft, her daughter was leaving quickly to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 of Niza, where the doctors worked without success to save her life.
"Nothing called regularly to say that it was very bad, that wasn't expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me I would die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I want you very much, my love.
I'll meet you ready.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave you to keep their heart slowly consuming and abandoning their body.
She's already dead a while before and now she's cut off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it was happening.
I couldn't cry nor weeping because I was in a rounding situation of families and people.
I had to stop me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that time of battle for the loss of her daughter, he entered into the fly together with other passors, without noting the calvary that he was painting.
"Nobody detected it," said he.
"I had my head low and fell down my skins all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but it was during the air when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity by Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted her."

"I thought that if we could get something like what he was requesting (a research during a limited and limited field), it is possible that we could get a little unit," Mr. Flake recommended the Sabbath, adding that the committee would be "recovered" because of the parallelisation of the parties.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his republists want the FBI to carry out the investigation?
Your reticence has a question of terms.
There are five weeks for the half-lexilation elections (or 6 November). If, as and as it is expected, the republicans get bad results, they will be seriously debilited in their trials to get the person who will be chosen for the maximum court of the country.
George W. Bush was calling Senators, exercising pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom, he knew his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr Bush.

You will make a vote in the Senate, which now busy 51 Republicans and 49 democratics.
It is still not clear if Mr Kavanaugh can achieve at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, break the empathy and confirm it to the Supreme Court.

This produced after the history of June meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un celebrated in Singapore, which agreed greatly to work to remove nuclear weapons in the Peninsula of Korea.
But the Sunday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, caused the sanctions imposed by the United States of the missing progress since then.
"If we don't trust in the United States, we can't trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we have a single unilateral way," said Mr. Ri in a discussion talked before the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says that it is not right to access to the Supreme Court
The leader of minority in the camera, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histerical" and ensures that he was not justified by his nature to access to the Supreme Court.
Folosi made these comments in an interview conducted the Sabbath in Texas Tribune Festival of Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't forget to think that if a woman had been conducted in this way, she would call historic," said Pelosi about its reaction against Kavanaugh's declaration before the judicial Committee of the Senate the young.
Kavanaugh rejected sexual advocations on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were adolescents.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh showed very embarrassed, in cases he almost wrestling and staying talking while he described his family and his institution years.
He also condemned the democratics of the committee, and cataloging the accusations against him as a "assisting of the great and coordinated reputation" organized by liberal offended by Hillary Clinton's destruction in the presidency elections of 2016.
He declared that he believed that Kavanaugh's declaration proved that he could not access to the Supreme Court because he proved that he had prejudiced against demokrates.
"I think it's disqualized himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democratics," he said.
He objected when it was asked if it was trying to impress Kavanaugh if it was confirmed in the place and if democratics get the most in the Representative Chamber.
"What I have to say is the following: if you're not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court that is now found," commented Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judged by the Court of Washington D.C.
It added that, as democratic, it was concerned with the possible resolutions that could adopt Kavanaugh against the law of protection to the patient and care of accessible health or the case of Roe against Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In confirmation views, Kavanaugh asked questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be interpreted.
"It's not the moment that a historical person and with prejudices access to the court and still on top hopes to say, look that good!", said Pelosi.
And women need it.
A justified diatribe, months and years of fuel disappears, and can't eject it without weeping.
"When we're hungry," Mrs. Steinem remarked 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, isn't it?"
He continued saying, "I received a lot of help of a woman who was executive in somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she was hungry, but that developed a technology that was in which, when she was hungry and began to cry, he said to the person who was talking, "The best you think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm hungry."
And then, I continued.
It seems brilliant."
The bowls are allowed to be as escape volvolume for wrath in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my most noted memories in one of my first work in a office dominated by men, in which I began crying with an impossible rabbit to describe, was that a greater woman took me away from behind the fish, a higher farm that always caused me a fearer, and leaded to the eye of the scale.
"You don't let them see you weeping," he said.
"They don't know you're wrestling.
I believe you're sad and they'll refort you if they're coming to you."
Patricia Schroeder, in that time a Democratic Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was collected in an accident outside of marriage in a boat named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential carrier, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason why he could not consider the idea of being presented to the President.
"It wasn't a well reflected decision," commented between rises 30 years later.
"They had seven candidates in the carrier and the last they needed was another.
Someone called "Brancaneves and the seven anals."
Because the campaign was advanced, he was leading in the fund recadation, so he sweared that he would not enter the carrier for the President to not be able to reach 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of those who supported her had $1,000 to men's candidates would only take $250.
"What do you think I've missed?", asked.
When he made his conversation to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by the emotions (with thanks to the people who supported it, of frustration with the system that difficulted the money receiving and directed to the voters instead of delegated and infringed by existing sexualism) remained without words.
"You would think she would suffer a nervous crisis," remembered Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted the press with her.
"You would think Kleenex was my patrocinator company.
Do I remember what they're writing in my laptop?
"Chorou?"
In order to be positive to the trade war between the United States and China to Peking
The initiatives of the trade war between the United States and China were inheritors and, although the war is far away to finish, a distance between countries may be beneficial to Peking a long-term period, they confirm experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginnings of this year by writeing Chinese key exports, including the sun panels, the acid and the aluminium.
The most significant scale produces this week with the implementation of new tariffs that affect an equivalent to $200,000, recording the half of the articles that come to the United States from China.
Pekin contratated each time in the same way, most recently submitting the tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent in 60,000 million dollars in American products.
China promised to imitate the US measures, and it seems not likely that the second biggest economy of the world would change the short term.
In order to get Washington back, it would be necessary to move before its exercises, but to double publicly before the United States would be much more comfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
Even so, experts say that if Peking knows to play their letters correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could enjoy China a long time when reducing the interdependence of the two economys.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Pequin could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in two countries is actually more dangerous than that it was recognised with previously known," said Abigail Grace, a central researcher in Asia Center for New American Security, a center of study.

"I don't like weeping frequency, but today I can't lose it.
It was a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choose and believe in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I can get the coffee.
The important is the team, and I'm happy to have helped," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriote John Ram, who could destroy the US lead from the golf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in the individual party of the Sunday party.
"It's incredible the honourable that I feel today because I could have destroyed Tiger Woods. I've grown to see playing that boy," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost his four party in France and now he has a register of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winner of 14 major, situated just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend to not go out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a golf of a high calibration during all the tour.
The Captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, declared after the frustrating order of his team: "I'm honourable of these boys, they fight.
This morning, for a moment, the Europeans were in difficulties.
We're fighting.
I take the shadow before Thomas.
It's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize us, I'll work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go forward.
I want these 12 boys and I'm honourable to be Captain.
It's to get out of the shadow.
It was higher."
