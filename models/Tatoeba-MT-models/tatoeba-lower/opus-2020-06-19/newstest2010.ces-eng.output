Barack Obama gets a fourth American president of Nobel's peace price
The American President Barack Obama will come to the North Osla at 26 hours to be here as the fourth American President in the history of Nobel's peace price.
In addition to 1,4 million dollars, the diplome, the medailles and the shoes will be achieved by exceptional efforts to distribute world diplomacies and cooperation between the nations.
The boss of the White house will come to the north metropolis morning and with Michelle's wife, and he will be smooth.
Firstly, he invites Nobel's Institute, where the first meetings with five members of the Committee, which chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President's couple then has a planned meeting with the northern King Harald V. and the King Sonjo.
On the afternoon, the visit will exhibit the celebration ceremonies on which Obama will transmit precise evaluation.
He gets him as a fourth American President, but the third time he gets the price directly in the office.
The white house has already stated that Obama will be on the review of the Afghanistan war.
The President does not want to exceed this subject because he knows that the price is overcome as President who is currently warning in two countries.
A lot of effort has increased by sending another unit to Afghanistan, which will not be forgotten to obtain any of its critics.
In Obama ceremonies, Obama has also gold medal, diplomas and shocks for ten million of Swedish corners (aproximately 24 million Czech corners).
You're supposed to give good purposes, but the particular charity hasn't yet decided.
Then, the president's programme will lead to the bank, except the northern King and the Queen, also the Ministerial President and other 250 hosts invited.
Besides, it's almost holding up from the beginning to the price.
For example, he showed that he feels that he doesn't serve her completely.
Sometimes he repeated that it was not only for him, but for all those who deserve the same values as he.
It's after the announcement, he showed that he's a call to action.
Protector of natural protection offended from disease
The Lithuanian police committed the Chairman of the Civil Assembly of the Protectors of the Nature of Lithoměr from the disease.
In some cases in the present year, the police speaker Alena Rom said to the Litomic police speaker.
The President of the Lithomary Community of Nature Protectors is Lubomir Student.
Now he's in the office and he's threatened to three years of prison.
Brnu's officers are not avoidable
In Praia, usual people can category boxes from drinks, on the South Morav Islands you will meet the continents at each step.
And in Brna?
There you will win a couple of minutes before you find a right room.
I don't want to make sure he's not in Brna's department.
But I'm going to find that we're the second biggest city in the Republic, they're not interesting in this problem.
Brno is in the field list of department class, not only because we can still be home in the classrooms of the continents, but in particular the number of packs on such a disaster.
Have you ever been trying in the center, for example, to get the PET lake into the collective waste?
It's ready, especially it wants time and hard nerves.
The only place I've found is on the Moreva's destination against Potrefene Huse.
Let Mr. Undka don't work at me with the colleagues, but I'm gonna get it a little bit.
It doesn't mean that there's no difference class in other parts.
The line of my friends wouldn't be able to fix it.
It's easy.
They've got it far away.
I don't care about them.
I've offered me alone to get a couple of bottles and plastic balls.
Only on the Counnical Street, I didn't see any colored capsule.
Happyly, I've traveled a road to the right place.
However, the disappearances of him have been transformed.
It's still the center of Brna, which may be the most representative city, right?
Only ecological and some steatics of bruneous socialists are not very interested.
These towns are more pleased to buy a hokey extraglish that makes us a republic entirely than they buy a couple of containers and offer other surveys for cleaner Brno.
I'm happy that I've been able to confirm the official statistics after a minute of brochure on the Internet.
According to the data of the ECO-Community, Brno is really the most mounted in the southern country.
"Parroubkov" took the money for the cost and the disease
Since the left has added the opinion of the Government to agricultors or officers, it is not necessary to be in the budget of money for costs, disease, or establishment.
But also on the measures of State duty or international courts.
It will make problems to those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says Eduard Janot Financial Ministry.
When social democracies and communists have developed a number of groups, they have concluded that the Government will also be raised up to the future, the laying of mine," says Janota.
From the payment of money, it's a lot of higher measures and it must be back sometimes.
There's no power to choose where to take it.
If social doses or costs are not reduced by the State’s currency, the data must be taken.
All that the left has now added to the ships, teachers, agricultors.
And later and their children.
The review or disease, from which the account has lost 1,8 billion, will not have to be afraid.
However, for the price that it will be more tolerable – the next year will not be mistaken only for 163 billion but more.
In the middle of the Ministry Janota, I'm trying to be so long to gain a faster and together with him and the costs of the measures.
The state will need money on its office and will not be sufficient to increase the DPH or to reduce the maternity as the government did in its contradictional package.
For the movement of money in the efforts of several volunteers groups in the next year, five billion dollars will also be mistaken for the driving and melting.
It is overwhelmed of the already exhausted and exposed measures that are not designed and incidentally raised.
You're the best to observe what isn't weird.
It means that the thirty large structures are thirty-sized or disappeared, it is also entrusted by the cutting of the European money, warns the speaking Minister of Carel Hanzelk's transport.
The CSSD proposed that the inhabitants of the money solve the Shanghai – brings into the CEZ distribution, which is from the majority of its own, and from them the fund of support.
The problem is that the higher division has never been sure, and it's not any more of the unbelievable source.
Loni was attached from the CHEZ to the budget of 18 billion.
Any year, from the division, the liquidation of ecological smokes shall be fulfilled or served as a reserve for the achieved significant reform.
In addition, this trimme under EU rules increases the real rate of the budget at level 5,7 per cent of HDP.
But the carneval doesn't end.
At least three billion were in the budget on various disagreements by the victim of communism and criminal acts or on the costs of judicial training, even for establishing.
If the state's gone without these money, it's not sure.
It's lottery.
If we're playing a international sport, we'll have to pay the same, it's John.
The Ministry will then have to take the money inside the reserve or in the worst case to achieve the government budget reserve.
Third millions are also missing the already separated two-liard project of the State bank that has to be able to monitor on-line, for which individual authorities are lost.
The first step starts in January.
If the Ministry of Finance does not find any money, the project should stop, the sanction comes, warns Janot.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans in the future count a mobile phone on which the user will press a single button to switch between various operating systems.
The disappeared plans seem promised.
Press one key and from Windows Mobile you will move to Android for a few seconds.
This is exactly this option for the purpose of the American VMware company, which is mainly focused on the development of the virtual software for computers.
We'll allow you to carry two user profiles on the mobile.
You can move between them, you can divide them on home and work.
Both will work in one and the same moment, he announced Srinivas Krishnamurti from the VMware company in a conversation for computer magazine.
The presentation was presented in November of the lonely year and a few days ago was first leading.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fishing.
VMware has already introduced a smartphone test model with two operating systems.
It was modified by Nokia N800 with memory of 128 MB size, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were also running.
The development of new mobile technology is in a full education.
The VMware company is now cooperating with European and American operators for the testing of smartphones and to informers should be achieved during 2012.
Neighborhood in the mountains track hotels
The Holy Congress don't be worried to the Cerchonian Heavens.
The missing snow distracts people and from dinner residences in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in the Krkonois, the rooms are still needed to be broken on all the middle terms, including Friday and Silvestra.
We have great visits on our pages.
People walk in offers, find prices, but they're still afraid to join.
And if they call to us, they'll immediately ask if the airport will be held by us, or on the ball," leader of the Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants to live in Spindler Mlynn exactly according to his imagination, he wouldn't have been with a joint.
He who gives the privilege of money and the quality of residence is at the other place, he can still try to wait for a few days.
Spindlerov hotels are still offered to Silvestra for a weekly residence.
I think they'll be trying to smoke, but then they'll allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the rooms will be free to stay quickly," Jandura replied.
The free bed in all ring terms is still offered and the Ingtours travel office.
Now, we're most interesting for a week of dinner that's not yet built.
The half of the places in our offering remains free.
That's why we've already built some lower districts at the last moment, "Ingtours Peter Schiefert's director.
Silvestra in the Krkonoses can still offer the highway office, but free places are less.
It's good to the apartment even the first fourteen days in the office, the rest of the limited terms are sold averagely.
Years of interest in the smooth residence affects negatively that in the Krkonois there is still no snow.
People wait if it's falling.
Nobody wants to turn the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If the weekly meetings will be held, they will also be established, "Mine Shiefert.
In addition, something better than the branches are given to contain the rooms of the hotel Horizont in Pesce under the Snow.
We're probably five percent better on this.
On Silvestra and the Sunday, we have the last couple of places.
Great interest is about the Poland Empires in January and is well sold in February," reported the best director of Karel Rada's best pick-hotel.
From the eighth percent of the aircraft residences and the hotel Omnia at the central parking room in Janische Lazas.
Even on the Sunday, there is a half of free beds in the New York Hotel.
At least a year he surprised us of the air that we already have in this moment, about 60%.
A little harder is even February, but when the snow falls, the interests of residents in the Krkonois are sure still stealed, he led the director of the hotel Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, at the larger part of the snow, the Cerconian hotels still have to let them go.
On the fourth day, if there's some shoes, they should be smooth on the mountains.
But then he needs to be opened again, he reported Jiri Jacobs from the raw worker of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It's complicated, with what school trial Barack Obama, President of the most sensitive report, repeated in the African question of the strategy of his president who was the most deepest.
Finally, when he was able to cut out his academic African doctrine, he showed that he wrote it through a copy of Bush’s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the same text, it uses the word "come in Iraq", but he could not even use the name of Bush's statement from January 2007 as its own statement: "New business path."
At the same time, he was criticized by Bush's idea to send courageous military forces to Iraq the following citizenship war as "in responsible and in his following catastrophical decisions."
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy out of the recommendation of the field officers was the only possible and successful way that they are not talking about Iraq today in reporting relations.
Bush did not influence the reputable but objectively left his advice a lot of thankful standard situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that it's a surprise.
For the increase of the military contingent, the field leaders required him again, especially the top of the African Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even under the subordinative normally criticized a striking shoes in the White House.
He asked for 40 thousand men to destroy the situation to be better.
The President had tried three months, but he didn't get anything better, and he had at least 10 thousand soldiers.
In Europe, there were five thousand other promises, although he was originally calculated at least 10.
The most problematic at the entire Obama Strategy seems to be his objective to start loading military from Afghanistan for 18 months and to complete this process for three years. The whole Obamo doctrine calls more questions than answers.
Many are sure that half increases give the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
The Irish society is relatively well coordinated through the brotherly murder wars of the last years, and its leaders respect the agreements.
Afghanistan's situation is described by an opaque sign - no one can take place and no agreements are held.
The Afghanistan Security forces are incorrectly prepared for these conditions every day to change Mrs according to what they do.
Political institutions, even though they are formally based, will remain only a wooden steel, for which they will continue to build patriarch room relations.
The emission of various ethnic groups of interests is usually comprehensively compatible with the independence of the measures that are more complicated by Pakistan and Iran influences.
Not to build a "Accessible State", which is the minimum objective of the whole operation, doesn't seem to be too real.
The time horizon of Obamo's strategy will make its volunteer.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan was just wounded and now they continued to explore.
Trust that the soldiers of sending to military guests for the purpose of "excellent return to home" makes a wonder done here, can only really romantic, really not touched.
From political view, the loading data of the military is clear of the responsibility, because Taliban will be considered as an inadequate adoption of the United States.
The last summary of the NATO showed that the desire of Europeans to participate in fight operations in Afghanistan is to be a minority.
The European policies do not have nor want to explain to their choices how Germany or Italy relates to war in the middle of India.
Another factor that can radically enter into the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to disappoint and the green sanctions in Iran, it will be raised up an override question before the United States, would not be trying to resolve the problem of military force.
The answer will be just at the time that, according to Obama, America will turn to a winning download from Afganistan.
However, each such solution will also be a dramatic rebellion in African situation.
The only place for Baracka Obama is the fact that the President's choices remain three years, and there is still enough time to come with another strategie if this is shown as a total accident.
Goldman Sachs bank managers have no rewards already been ready
The high employees of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not be prepared in the air year of reward.
It announced the company that so reacts to the island of its wedding practices.
The Group of 30 former managers will be taken in place the money of the action that will be sold for five years.
Action may also be taken to managers in the case they will risk immediately.
Goldman Sachs is taking place as Reuters Agency will make an attempt for a reward on Wall Street with a long-term execution.
I believe that Wall Street is well known by the larger direction that needs to be exposed, the old investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem's in detail, he adds.
Banca Goldman Sachs became a tertiary criticism after the first three-fourth year of the aircraft was given at least 17 billion dollars (before 300 billion Kč) for a reward.
The total reward in the aeroplane year according to the Reuters Agency, of course, will take 20 billion dollars today.
The high rewards in the bank sector were in a number of countries with the financial crisis.
In the middle of the British stated that the balances of bankers over 25,000 libraries (except 712,000 Kč) are one of the same rate of 50 per cent.
The normal steps are also prepared for France.
Women's anniversary got Nobel's price in all areas except physics
Record five women today in Stockholm were exchanged by the Swedish King Carla XVI. Gustafa Airport Nobel Prices in a good category and literature.
After four scientists between them were also a German writer of Hert Müller's origin.
The nobel price for medicine had received two American biosystems of Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider together with their country Jack Sustack for the research in chromosome areas.
The price for chemicals took Israel Ada Jonathan together with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the publication of the structures and the functions of ribozoms.
The last laureat had Nobel's price for the economy that received the American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson for economic management analysis.
The only nice category that had been looking for years without a holding was physical.
This price has been carried out by scientists Charles Kao for research in the area of Optical Flights and George Smith with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip, which is based on all digital photographs, faxs or astronomical distances.
Each evaluation has overcome the diploma, the Nobel medailed and testifying the rate of financial rewards.
This in each category has ten million of Swedish corners (except 25 million Kč).
If they are mentioned in each of them more, I will share between myself.
Traditionally unexpected Nobel's price for peace has already received this afternoon in North America President Barack Obama.
In his statement, he recognized the consistency of his appreciation, because he was first at the beginning of his ways and also stands in the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and in Afganistan.
In the context of its policy, he added that wars are in certain situations necessary to eliminate peace, even though the price for it is high.
Klaus invited him to Grad.
President Vaclav Klaus accepts the fifth morning Ministry of Eduarda Janotta, which considers the meetings in the government, because it does not agree with the like state budget for the next year as it approved in the middle of the Poslanec Snow.
It is supposed that the payment and the possibility of Janot's meetings in the cabinet will be the subjects of their fifteen meetings.
The payment also criticizes Klaus.
According to him, he has too high deficit that continues to prevent the crisis of public financial.
The Chairman of the President's speaker, Radim Ochvat.
On his next meeting in the function, Janota wants to work with the president Jane Fischer on Monday.
According to the law of the budget that Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should be economic with 163 billion corners.
However, in the middle, the proposals of the levie on the movement of the money and increased the money on the payment of States employees, the implementation of social services and the right payment to agricultors.
The Government has exceeded the proposals of social democracy that are hiddenly increased by the budget.
In the middle of the left on one and Government, Klaus and the right on the other side, there has been a western intropolitic sport, because it began to address a questionnaire on the next field of the official office of Fischer, on which ODS, ČSSD and Green Pages were established.
The crisis claims that the payment as it has been accepted, basically liabilizes the packaging of sustainable measures that the Government of Fisher proceeded in the ground and that should stop the debt of the State.
Klaus, whose law on State budget can, but also does not have to be signed, on the current discussions with the companies stated that politicians had a longer time a "great problem", which is "incompatible deficiency" of public financials.
He has no good solution today.
The improvement could only bring a strong government, which could also take place on the larger political consensus, less President.
The Chairman of the OSs Mire Topolan instructed that the budget is terrified and the government should consider another existence.
The Chairman of ODS Peter On the time said that the Conception of the official cabinet with the support of CSSD, ODS and Green Federation is not clearly functioning.
Premier Fischer in the reaction marked the similar words as "great expressions".
Boss CHSSD Jire Paroubek on Topolanka replied that it was a terrible rate of budget that the old Topolan government prepared for this year and over 200 billion corners.
In the Mediterranean, the CSSD has already marked the approval of the State budget for the next year of success.
They were also happy.
Mandelu in the news of Clinta Eastwood won Morgan Freeman
South Africans say that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The world is unable to imagine a lot of earth, about its battle and victory in some critics that the major role of the American heroes create.
The story reports about sports, race dimensions and Nelson Mandel.
The unnamed fighter against the rasist apartheid mode in South Africa and her first Black President Nelson Mandell in his life history represents a Oscar American herea, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela was one-year-old mandela asked if he could create him in Eastwood's movie.
There's another significant role in it, Matt Damon.
I said to him, "If I will play you, I'll have access to you.
Two-five-year-year-old herec, who received the price for the role in Eastwood's drama from the box of Milion Dollar Baby, has already created, for example, the leader of the bondage of slavery, of which finally became a slave, a fulfillment president of the United States and even God in God’s Evan, but only one who lives and is for many people as important as Mandela.
The South African Stater was 27 years in prison for his active work for the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
The freedom was released in 1990 and four years later became President of the country.
In 1993, Nobel's price was designed for peace.
Invictus is the Latin word for non-profit and it is the name of the basic English author William Ernesta Henley, published in 1875.
The call was talking like him.
The dream is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined the strength with the Captain of the South African Ragby team of Francois Pienaar to help join the land. The new election President Mandela knows that his nation remains still rare and economically divided.
They believe that his people can connect through sport, so it will be decided to join the players of rags that are in the world measure between the outsides.
The South African Team will finally be carried out to the World Train of 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to get Mandel's story on the plane.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I'd close to her to the most real," said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest call was to speak like him.
Herec said that if he and the world policy were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, to meet him, to be in school before his appearance.
It was the most important thing that Mandel wanted to steal his hands.
I've found that when I print your hand, I'll cut your energy, he's moved, and I felt I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon works in the film Françoise Pienaara, Captain of the National Ragby Team, in which the white players were considered.
Herec said that he had six months to prepare his role in the vast world of ragby.
A great surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I called to the home call, he opened me and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In a movie I look greater."
In the middle of clarified differences in the positions of hercs in comparison with their real proposals under the manager Eastwood, Invictus received: Unforgetted fair reviews and talking about ambitions in Oscar.
The film crisis of Daily Variatey Todd McCarthy raised his evaluation to the word, "I was very good story, very well done."
In film recensements on web sites Rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 per cent of positive assessment.
Several secrets on Norway were distributed: Russian tested the raket
It was possible to observe the special light effect of the unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Protection once yesterday agreed that the northern borders were tested between the continent balistic racket.
But the start was not successful again and the shooting marked as a type "Bulava", which had to be originally the russ' army's honour, it becomes a black shadow of Russian generals and the Premier Vladimir Putina.
Not his recurrent presence in the tests of the rackets had no effect on the success of the experimental years.
The majority of the bulva has not detected or washed in the air.
In Russian newspapers, it's already written about "Bulava" as a "racket that doesn't fly."
Rakett that doesn't fly but light
This is the 13th trial in order. It's normally the start of the beginning.
At the end of the plane, the technical packaging was reached.
Of course he explored the engine in the third grade of the rackets.
This time "Bulava" started from the atomic ponory Dmitry Donskii, which rained under the white sea.
This type of rackets allows shooting from the ship that is in moving and at least north.
That is therefore likely that the crucial light on Norway made near the unexpected flying object was actually raised by "Bulava".
Last Norways hadn't been sure that it was a Russian racket.
Generals this time shoot and say that they can't be talking about unfortunately.
The first two degrees of the rackets were achieved, and the accident was at the third.
In the past cases, the engines were in the first grade.
Although there was no trial start without a failure, the Ministerial Defence leads only six of the thirty.
If the 50% of the success is therefore the general fulfills optimism and still says that "Bulava" will fly once without problems and that even to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks on the maximum total temperature of 1,15 tons.
Legislative Fetisov signed in 51 years of the annual Treaty in CSKA Moskva
Legislal Fetisov is repeated in 51 years in the professional hokea exploitation.
It is a master of the world, the olympian wind and the stanley Cupu's maintainer will help the CSKA Moskva team and, of course, will now be in the fifth dust of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished the carrier forty years in 1998, is currently president CSKA.
After that Denis Kuljasch, we need another rebellion.
Fetisov regularly treated and agreed to help the team.
We only need to resolve some formal opportunities, the AP Square Agency of Sergey Germany's Moscow club.
It's not clear if comeback's hookie's hookie's will be involved only one sample.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can invoke the spirit of other players, who brought Germany.
Fetisov is thus in accordance with the AP in the case of return to the ship becomes the oldest Russian professional hokejist.
In the NHL, he held the whole meeting for Hartford's legitimate attorney Gordie Howe in one-four years and wrote 15 gols and 26 assistance.
The most oldest of the fifth fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and successful hokejists history.
In the wood of the Soviet Sweden, he received two olympian gold, seven titles of the world's master, triumphed on Canada Cupu and the junior world championate.
In the second part of his carriers, he collected success and in the NHL, where Detroit carried twice on the head of Stanley Cup.
Since 2001, it is a member of the Hokey Sine of glory.
Hyundai has spoken to the advisory. He cancells all the time.
Hyundai cars leading with the department agreed to interrupt all overtimes.
In fact, because of the periods often referred to were reported by the meetings on the lunch of the stage preparation.
He confirmed the talking car Hyundai Petr Vagnek.
However, the officers want to agree with the officers on another aeroplane.
We can't recalcule our production plan, that's basic, so it was proposed a welcome transition on Saturday 19 December to make two changes, said Vañek.
Server Seven.c wrote that the company of employees who reject the Sabbath change offered bonus 400 Kč.
These people will be reached back, even for the workshop 28 November.
The company decided to change the way of motivation of employees for the proposed period.
Let them pay for a payment for a time, or they can choose the replacement free of December 28, and then, on the day of the celebration, he brought Vagina.
Furthermore, all employees of the Sabbath changes will be paid for officers and food.
Considering that the periods were the most urgent and latest point of view of the reminders and the assurance of the experts, and the protesting employees, which last week have stopped the production, so the leadership decided with the time of discharge of all periods for the month procedure.
The car employees were practically employed each day after the eight-hour change, for the last week.
After the signature of the Agreement of the Staff Preparation, they shall repeat
Another treatment between cars and explorers must be done at the week afternoon.
The officer of the officer Peter Kucharer in the middle said that if they agree to fulfill the requirements and the common document, they are prepared to cancel the stage.
The situation in the car was explored last week in the middle of 400 spontan employees because of unfortunate transition.
They also protested against the wrong fulfill conditions and the traditional chinese.
The officer stated that the employee should do the time for the fulfillment of vehicles requirements.
Officers in their lunch statement were also requested to not be established by any sanks who had been suspended in the middle of the production.
In the overtime areas of the office, the office requires to reduce the transitional work at the minimum.
Moreover, they want to pay 5000 corners in the air year.
The Hyundai car is now employed by 2000 people.
The serial production of the company has developed a lone in November.
At September, 80,000 cars produced, its current production capacity is annually 200,000 cars.
Czech reveal: substance that kills both the virus of HIV
The Team of Chess and German scientists test new combinations that can reduce HIV virus in the body.
The main exhibition of the substance is that it will also kill the vires that have already obtained against immune medicinal products.
This fact, in some cases, convinces that the combination of a regular variety of virus does not apply as strong as some already available treatment.
AIDS can't remedie anyway.
However, patients can expressly extend the life of medicines that take the number of HIV virus in the body.
However, their uses are carried out a number of further effects.
Incompletion of the multiple virus has also the consequence of the development of resistance virus, such as resistance virus, which are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three Academy Academy science CHR, from WSCHT Praha and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to resistance virus.
They demonstrated that the substances called metalcarbons were responsible for the number of HIV virus.
Metal carbons are cold by boat, water, carbon and cobalt.
These combinations block the wide widespread other than all the used medicines, so they can perform resistance problems.
In their work, the scientists are coming with the new "proliferated" columns prepared by the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their designs on the man's white.
Metalcarbons have a single tridimensional structure: two multisecond kleps created by bowl, water and hydrogen are connected by atom of coffee, in this case, in the case of cobalt.
Traditional and radial virus
HIV protease is a white-cookine of HIV virus, which is necessary for life cycles of virus.
Without HIV Protease of the HIV-sufficiency, the infectious viral party would not be distorted.
When we stop HIV Protease, we stop and expand the virus in patients' body, scientists explain in the print report published by the organic chemicals and the biochemie Academy of the CRR.
In the work published in the scientist magazine Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe the series of combinations in which there are two couples of cups (see table) associated with a short organic string that is systematically modified.
What's more hard, but more complicated
The effect of this series of substances against HIV Protease was tested in the test and also against its (resistious) variations received from patients held by HIV virus.
The effect of metacarbons on a regular enzyme variable is not as strong as in clinically used medicines, however, the effect of non-perishing for resistance variables that are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of the effect and their other properties such as bio and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical energys such as from metalcarborans makes interested associations for further research to propose effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlin Greek, leadering the structural biological equipment of organic chemicals and biochemics and the establishment of molecular genetics Academy.
ODS left the fishery, the ODS's heading.
Boss ODS Mirake Topolank marked the approved budget for the next year for "sweet" and the Government of President Jan Fischer should consider another existence.
The ODS expressed the President of the Government for strong explanations.
He leaves time to analyze.
ODS Peter At the time he said that the concept of the official cabinet with CSSD support, ODS and Green Pages is not clearly functioning.
The Chairman of the Government should be decided whether it is appropriate to take into account the minority of the growth deficit or to be achieved in the functioning of Parliament's leftness.
ODS access and social democracy to the problems of public deficits is diameterally different, noted Netime.
In the Mediterranean, it took a budget for 2010, however, with left change proposals for more than 12 billion corners.
In addition, it increased the money on the payment of State employees, the implementation of social services and the payment to the agricultors.
The ex-governmental government on the address of social democracy proposed was, therefore, that they hiddenly higher the budget.
The RR should be economic with 163 billion corners.
The ODS went out of the salary before the voting came out, and thus explaned the government, that the changed budget is less worse than the budget provision.
Declaration and favour
The Ministry of Financial Eduard Janota declared the declaration and favour of marriage, President Jan Fischer showed that the Government of the current situation still agreed.
Sometimes, it is convinced that if Janota had a serious decline from the function in the case of accepting amendment proposals, it could appear to be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota was published on the Sunday after the government to the Premier.
He noted, however, that he considers further meetings in the function.
It's why he's disappointment on the budget.
If Fisher will be expressed for another fight with the field of budget, they do not according to the Office of the CSSD nameds, which have proposed changes in the budget.
The Premier should also say clearly that it gives demis, if it approves further deficit laws, such as those concerned with disease, customs, or new service law.
Body: The Ministry of nominal ODS has not been proceeded
This is the matter of the Ministry President of Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministry of the nominal OSs did nothing wrong, the Topolan in the text report from the United States.
He reminded that in some ministry, people who were notified to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
At the time, he remarked that if Fischer decided to recalcule the principles of battle with the highest field of public finances, "it's just logical and correct that the left majority, which is currently in mind."
Then he can't count with support and tolerant civil democracies.
I didn't think about that, and when it is now, I'm going to celebrate it, he said to the newspapers in the presence of the Minister of Defense of Martin Bartak, who was just called citizen democracies.
Premier Fischer went from the European Council to Brussels on the midnight.
ODS premier requested
At the same time, the ODS would certainly vote against the amended budget in the middle of the ODS if the president of civil democracies had not explicitly requested to accept the budget.
We don't look like seroots, we're not small children, then replied to the question whether the OSS in the political expenditure of the budget has not succeeded in the presidency of the parties in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I wasn't sure my voice would be wrong.
Now when I was on the mandate, I knew that in the next months, especially about the painful dreams and the destruction of all the positive, he reacted alone to Topolan.

The role of a worldwide fighter against the apartment was achieved by Morgan Freeman, who was low for his creation for years ago chose Mandela himself.

With this image to the chinees, the crisis and public axes are raised up
Nelson Mandela
The whole name of Nelson Rolihla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 Sachar's price received for freedom of thinking, and in 1993 with Klerek Nobel's price of peace.
President of South Africa was in 1994-1999.
Great expectation, since it comes to publicity during the period when the South African Republic, however, the preparations for world shadow in the photobale, including the media, are concerned about the growing racial hate and discrimination of the citizens from the majority of the Black Government.
According to the AP reporting Agency, a new film in JAR is a range of positive universe, as well as through reading expenditures with the main "profilled" role of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, but, according to his words, a new movie's horrible.
I dreamed about that role for years, and I was ready for her well.
I also felt personally with Nelson Mandelou, to - as I say - he broke his energy, and made his conversation after the celebration of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandelov's personality and message.
It's a story of South Africa, but it's about each person, added.
In the road of the national rug team
The dream based on the proposal of the British writer John Carlin with free-translated name in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that has made to be able to cut off the nation by the South African resident of human rights during his first president's election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to smoke two rases and long-term groups of citizens together together and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the hereafter role in the South African National Rugby tree on the world's floor that JAR won.
In the entrance of the traitor in the tree understood at least as a holy thing, Mandela struck a big egg overwhelmedly the white public and received recognition of the white citizens.

In Lounska, a transformer for 10 million corners
It's been able to celebrate the transformer of the Chaps' company morning in the divorce at the outside of the High Square in Lounsk.
It contains six units by the speaker of the speaker of the national hazards Lukache Marvana.
Originally, the Hassiers wanted to leave the transformer to go out, but later, the view was determined and the fire washed with water mixture, pigs and special hash.
The reason was technical responsibility, the internal rate of the transformer.
Nobody has been destroyed, the shipping according to the speaker company of Paully Mandaat does not exceed safe transport facilities.
The disease is raised to a few decades of corners, exactly to calculate it until the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformer will be replaced by the Mandat's new.
For ten years, Chaps' companies had nothing like that, the commitments of this type are united, fulfilled.
The additions of the electrical product were not affected according to the speaking company of the CEZ for the North Czech Soni Holinger Hedrichs, the functioning of households, offices or trafostanic fire.

Janczura provides a criminal notification for the discussion on three chairmans of the CSSD
Leader of Student Agency Radim Janczura today provides a criminal report on three social-democratic leaders.
And this is on Michal Hashka from the Southern country, the Martín's Council from Parduba and the Captain of Martin Tesareka.
Janczura took it in 20 minutes of the Radiojurnal.
The challenge is to ensure that the companies are trying to carry out the regional flow transport in some countries.
All regions, but finally, signed long-term agreements with the Chess Dears.
All three chiefs are fighting us and talking about what we're going to choose, and then we've brought a gift only to what they wanted.
They say we're better than the Czech Roads, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Drahs which were closed last week.
So we're not staying before we're protecting.
It's for talking to the Student Agency's company, he said the Radiojournal Janczur.
He also pointed out that he had evidence of all countries that they did not make their steps in accordance with the European law.
It is therefore prepared for the European Commission.
The shipping of the criminal notification is considered to continue the medical show of Mr. Janczury, which serves him as an impropriate recruitment of his company and his own person.
I'm fully ready to take my good name and my country and the same call and other captains.
I believe that in this opportunity, it is clearly Mr. Janczura, who manipulates publicity and uses living and unrighteous arguments, has introduced Hashek.
Janchura announced the past week that he invests a number of million corners to a reklame that will be incorrect to warn the past of countries.
The Radiojournal said that the campaign after the Wednesday can interrupt and continue in it after New Year.
He suggested that the campaign will be led against corruption as such.
The campaign started Janczura after the countries agreed to implement regional fertilization connections with the Chess Dragues and to the law of about 150 billion corners.
According to Janchur, it is similar to contrast law and in relation to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the crisis of travel transport in countries, Janczur has already been assaulted by the CHSSD.
The only expenditure was that if we don't leave it, we can get the bus licence.
He was as a CHSSD messenger, I know what Mrs does, I will not tell his name today, says the Radio Yančura.
Waiting against pneumotics will be free and unrequired
Waiting against pneumotics from a year-of-deceased normality.
It must be as the first for the families without money and even unbelievable.
But they are already calling the voices that it would be more effective.
Preparing to introduce a free expectation against the top-border.
The medicine has already established the maximum price of vaccins that will pay health insurance.
The experts also have clearly in the expectation process.
New expectation
Vaccines for Sarpen Children
Since January, you can be expected to be freely expected against children who were born in line 2. August and later.
The condition is that there was no dose of expectation yet.
Whoever started waiting for a lone or previously, he must offer himself and more expectations.
The first dose of expectation must be given between 3 and 5 months of the child.
The lone has already left his children to wait against the fourth family.
The parents paid 1600 corners for one dose and more.
In the expectation of the youngest children, four doses are needed.
The entire officers say that health insurances are delivered to 300 to 450 thousand corners each year.
But they're surprised to the treatment that children would need without waiting.
In this country, for all the worst expectations of the child, he gave up 500 thousand a year.
The severe expectation was carried out by the Janot package.
Pneumokok causes the concentration of the middle ear, but also significant infections including the brain white and blood branches.
At the pneumoc infection with us for a year, he dies according to the investigation of hospitals to 28 children to 10 years.
In addition to the Czech, the child’s worst expectations in 40 countries.
Would it be necessary to wait?
On the other hand, the views of the future may be necessary in the future.
Since January, it must be severe and unbelievable.
That it would be necessary to wait better, for example, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovski leader of the citizenship.
His group of pneumoc vaccine propagates long-term vaccins.
The experts in the international conferences that our meeting participated were not fully satisfied with that we have welcome expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're glad that it's able to make it at least.
I think it's the way we need to get up now, he brought the Kalifornian.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure of expecting against pneumatics.
In this moment we don't think of it, he said his own owner Shn.
Favourite expectation has its disagreements, the doctor's worthy
The Chairman of the Beauty of the Practical Child Medicines of Hana Cabrnoch recognizes that he has the grateful expectation of his disabilities.
If all children were expected, it could be considered to reduce the number of reviews, "For the situation when these vaccins are so high, we will likely understand the political decision that the expectation has been restarted as good," says Cabrnoch.
The experts expect that their cookes are waiting for pneumotics from the next year more than 80 percent of honourable parents.
Waiting against pneumotics is an average, and it is, as the first plot waiting for children, a healthy safety, not State.
Securities should give money to prevention, take care of another medicine, explains Cabrnoch.
The doctors will have to buy the substances themselves
However, the concerns of the practical children’s doctors concerned to buy vaccins.
In accordance with the original purpose, the vaccines should be buyed insurance and the doctors would get them as such as the State adds their substances to other expectations.
Some messengers were afraid that they could "export the money from health insurance."
The doctors therefore have to buy and wait until they have a safe payment.
According to the disorders, individual practices of children will invest in vaccin 40 thousand months, which is a significant sum.
It's not easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of the American artist 'cradl in the museum'
The son of the named American creator Frank Frazetta was committed by trying to struggle images for $20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania showed that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was appropried by putting 90 images into his car and his storage.
The named Mr. Frazetta and the second man used to enter the museum in the region Poconco Mountains bagr.
Mr Frazetta's elder, 81 years old, has been proud of the creation of Barbara Conana and Tarzana.
In the time that it happened, the artist was located in Florida, as she brought the Asociated Press.
The AP had cited the non-named police officer, who said that Mr. Frazetta was younger to be motivated by long-term family sports.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta gave a younger statement, 52 years old, that he did so on his father's view, "to get to the museum in some way of possible and transmit images to the smooth space," as the agent introduced.
Mr. Frazetta's elderly deployed any commitment to the agent.
Labourists are raised by the planned growth of data
The Ministry refused the growth of the data and the reduction of the expenditure announced in the proposed report on the budget of the criticism from the areas of obsession, businessers and departments.
As Alistair Darling introduced, the Touris "promarni" to show that they really think the decision to reduce the deficit to the time after choices.
And the officer was able to be under the ball because of training with low and central accommodations.
According to its proposal, the increase of 0,5 % in social assessment and 1 % of the reform of public payments since 2011.
Resolution on social security
The departments protested that the workers with lower accommodations were carried out for receipt that they didn't allow and warned before the "problems".
Social assessment is higher - increases at least 3 billion books each year - which has contributed to the community of businessers who have believed that it is one of the payment of employment, while it should be achieved for the re-economies.
This increase, which is limited to these accommodations above 20000 liters per year, is at least 10 million employees.
CLAY BOODS PBR
Social ensure increases more than 0,5 % since April 2011
Economic situation is worse than expected, about 4,75 % in this year.
New rate of 50 % of banker bonus
Amount of 1% of fire data for resignation in small firms
Decrease data for electric and wind electrical
Increasing investment measurement of 2,5 %
According to the State Financial Management, some 30,000 books are reduced by 90 libraries a year and some of 40000 books are reduced by 190 library, while non-except 10000 library is increased to 110 libraries.
The Ministers noted that their objective to reduce the deficit to half the year 2013 means "sufficient decisions", but that 60 % of special data should be attached to 5% of persons with the highest acceptance.
Stephen Timms Financial Ministry declared that the data growth and expenditure limits were "cap in the ocean" in comparison with what should be carried out.
"It's a big number, this allows us to reduce the deficit in half, which is absolutely a basic requirement for the next four years," he shared BBC.
Mr. Timms stated that it was convinced that economic growth should be achieved for the last year.
But the processing of prognoses for future economic growth - which will be influenced on the needed pieces and how quickly deficit will be reduced - must be the door in the chair after the office was given to the audit of the previous parts.
In the context of the opinion, the economy rate was at 4,75 % in this year - far worse than 3,5 % preliminary in April - because the currency was 3 billion library higher than the previous.
Increasing opportunity
Concerts, who started in the fourth of the new propaganda campaign warning before the labour's crisis of the labour, marked 789 billion books during the following six years in unanimous.
The Ministers failed to submit a faithful plan, as it could be offered, to add "cinick" to this decision until after elections - which must be carried out to June 2010.
"They have not received anything significant that would be able," he brought the Scientific Financial Ministry of Philip Hammond. "They had the possibility to do it, but they've done it."
"All important notifications will be made by options if we win it."
Roger Bootle, Delotte
The Laboratory continues that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future shoes from the proposals of the Touris, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and in the largest area.
But liberal democracies say that the money reached by the increased data and the costs should be used for the support of expenditure in the next year and not to reduce the deficit, and they say that the plans are "played on a pitch".
Political commentary BBC Nick Robinson made a reporting time - for example, the higher inflation has increased and will be incapable of paying a dose in the next April - that it would be possible to carry out the office in the election campaign if the money would have reached hardly for a year later.
But the labourists continue to provide special assistance if people need very much and the situation will be reduced on September 2010.
Subsequent budget
Although the Ministry had not published the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economic stated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would be only the beginning of the average limits.
The recognised budget studies Institute declared that the office ciphers indicate sustainable scars in many areas, potentially in the construction of transport, high school and protection.
"It's actually very painful," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the choices, if we win it," added Roger Bootle, the Economic Advice for Deloitte accounts.
"It was a report of the suspect of the previous budget, and the thresholds are implementing it."
FBI cares in the "American prisoners in Pakistan"
The FBI's investigation in Pakistan in five Americans who are understood by the explosion of extremists.
Mans were arrested for an attack on the house in Sargoda in Eastern Pandjab, as BBC of America's majority in Pakistan.
The FBI said that it was one of the investigation, whether it was about the men who were spoken in the last month in the Virginia State.
The United States Ministry of the United States declared that it was also about information on these men.
Three of them say that they are the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian pregnancies and others go out of Jemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested for what conditions they had been arrested and what circumstances they had been held there," described Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Swiit told that the agent was informed about the prison and was in contact with the families who were entered students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistan authorities to determine their identity and the attention of their beginning here and whether it actually acts about sinned students," she said.
The Pakistan's majority in Washington showed that men were locked in the house that is one of them.
It showed that the house was always in the middle of the local police, and that there was no offence against prisoners.
The Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment the arrests, reported the print agent Reuters, but said that the United States must cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the discovery of the terrorism infrastructure that continues in recreation and effort.
The limit of those five students from the house in North Virginia was announced to their families at the end of November.
Refuse amnestie for the Iran treatment.
The situation in the maintenance of human rights in Iran is the same as in the last 20 years, as the report of the Amnesty International Report.
The report describes a detailed "Publics of Munition" in the mode before and after the sport president's options in June.
One of the men showed that he was a bit and fell by cigarettes, and another showed that he's worried to disturb him.
Iran exceeded the above criteria of this report on maintaining human rights.
The officers marked this crisis as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and ten of them were killed after the sport election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejadad, which led to the largest demonstration from the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
For ten of them, the claims and the officers denied the last five persons to death.
The BBC reporter in the Teheran John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that before in the protests, the highest leader of Ayatolah Ali Chomein announced the illegality of several ways of torture and prohibited their execution in the real Karizaq device.
But since that time, there were almost no legal crisis, as he brought our letter.
Incorrect recognition
Amnesty International citated the report of the 26-year-old student of the Countries of Ibrahim Methari, who pointed out that he was accused of "Facebook's network" and protests against the results of the elections.
"It was a lot to me in the face," he said.
"They smoked me with cigarettes under the eyes, on the hair, on my head, and they cut me down and throw me down."
After five days, he signed unrighteous recognition and was released and left on the street, still blood and half in ignorance, Amnesty.
In August, the president's candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested by protests after elections and was taught to die in prison, and others were disappointed.
The Iranian High-State Officers denied the offence of disagreement, but they allowed them to be punished.
Amnesty also introduced the case of an old prisoner, which pointed out that he was held in the continent with other 75 persons after a longer than eight weeks in the prison in Karibik.
Amnesty recognised that the Iran Parliament and the Justice had committees to investigate permissions and reactions governments, but had not been published by the mandate and authority of the authorities.
The group stated that at least 90 persons were arrested in the past three weeks to reject another demonstration.
In the town park, the cybers were created
More than 100 tons of artist snow was used to change the memories in Bristol in a congressial travel.
The shipping train of the park was attached to 16 half-professional employees and snowboardists to consolidate the financial prices.
On the top of the congress travel in the Brandon Hill Park, a short Scocain City was a 100 m long assembly travel.
John Hickman's fourth year's medicine student said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the Congress Roads, but it was actually amazing.
It was a beautiful view of the nearby light of the city down.
There were some of the best cybers and newspapers in the whole country - some of them were real talents," added.
The prices were made for the best cows - or manufacturers on the assembly road.
After the fourth evening wedding, the snow was left to decline.
They're still ours.
Can it be a French muslim?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the sector state.
At the time when the Swiss choicers called on the statement of minerals and generally broadcasts of the reports on the European islamism, John Bowen, the American academic, wrote and informed and thought whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they integrate - into one of the most openest continents.
Some of the readers have been observers of the last author's work, "Why Frances don't like the head" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of sport questions that are divided and employed by the country for 15 years, and their effects are still courageous.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has larger and more ambitional.
As a good antropolog wants to know not only what the policies and media have made about islam in France, but what really happened in the basis.
He worked all months in the mess, schools and institutions that are now age 5 ± 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, playing discussions between teachers and students about questions that are most concerned.
Does Muslim have to enter a marriage in the box or on the railway (or on both places)?
Should the young Muslim be learned about the development and the rights of the gas?
Can Muslim be a man who is not Muslim?
Do you have the right to use the particular bank system or if you want to get a hypothesis?
These are the most important world's sports issues that are discussing, and which are part of each day life less than the political dramatics that do the media.
The author identifies a new generation of immunity, teachers and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, does not include Tarika Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academy born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open discussions about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern collective society.
They don't have arguments for all of them.
Concerts are untrusted in the real ideas of French or European islam.
The philosophy and activists with which Mr Bowen interviewed are admitted to the house that it is concerned with the Prostitutor of Selafi, the puristry of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia – this group is small, but it affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French sectorism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
Klade asks how far the French politicals are (a intellectual elite that has so harmful publicity) to decline the thought of pluralism.
It is the opinion that the Muslims have been in the matters of faith, probably less experiences than Catholics, protestants and Jews, who also had to do historical compromises with the Secular Republic.
Besides the development of pragmatism, he detected "training of values".
After reading this book, somebody can't say, "Yeah, but not now."
The most increasing views in the world
Architect changes faster than the other environment.
It's an alarming speed that affects animals and their survival as nowhere.
The oil, plots and fisheries companys must be subject to new natural water sources, together with diplomates, lawyers and writers in their publication.
In the book "In this age," Richard Ellis, writer and ilustrator, is the natural history of the North's icons, the Polar Mediterranean.
Good recognised with complicated history and publicity procedures describes the long-term tradition of polary researchers who tried to strengthen the white medium.
The meeting of Nelson with a fourteen-year-year-old baller who was fighting only with the muscles is really myth, but everything else is true.
Young medicians who fled for their body of their killed mothers were captured and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar media were in one circus state.
Even today areas in zoo have typically million times smaller than the area that they are available to grow arose in divorce. Climate is a suitable equipment: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing in the low hairs of its coat.
When you click here, you'll find more!
Mr. Ellis's defense of the work of other writers and historics and often returns to the threat that the woods are threatening the survival of the species.
Although the law is denied in Norway, America and Russia, the murder continues in Greenland and Canada, where the helicopter and Indians are held on the skins, and all are armed with executive avoiders who shoot their use.
Ironic is that it will be driving in the north of these two half nations and that the rain will be the greatest.
In his new book "Poss air" Alun Anderson, an old editor New Scientist, offers clear and unfortunate knowledge responsibility for Arktid and a low-term plane to how it can change the future.
Not all of the scientists have answers.
No meteorologists and oceanographs have no additional response to change speed.
That's for the unexpected trial.
The studies of Fridtjofa Nansens at the end of the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century, the first stated how the air moved.
The potters for the cold war, then they were cutting up the transparency when they cut them up.
Satellite investigation and extensive fields of satellite fields are useful, but many are still finished by the unpersoned individuals who are built in the zoom.
Mr. Anderson looks at the outside of the artic ice system, which is created by the smoking of waters that are smoking in the smoking.
However, from the top of the media to microscope wonders within, it is all condemned to the end when the air is achieved, which is sometimes occurred between 2013 and 2050.
For a few months, we can be ours.
6000 passengers have set a branch on the graves in Arlington
The officer De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, walked seven hours of bus to put a simple branch on the soldier's tomb, and he never shoot.
For him and the other merchants of Johnson's camp in Jacksonville in North Carolina to the National Garden in Arlington to build the graves, it was the day when he took the tent of men and women who had ever taken the same way.
After a few months when we're born, we can be ours, Robinson said about the falling soldiers.
If that happens to us, I want someone to do the same for me so that he shows me respect as I'm trying to do it just me.
He was one of more than 6000 volunteers who gathered this Sunday morning to put prisons on the grave veterans in several separates in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, master of Worcester's enterprise company in Harrington in Maine, started this tradition when he and some others decided to build a few hundreds of graves in Arlington.
Now it's 18 years old tradition when Mr. NMorill with his wife Karen takes this way every year and stops in various cities by the way to worship the memory of the army and the victims of terrorism.
Worcestester doesn't look for a winner, for example, the branch of America, which are also based in other States.
In this year, more than 16000 winds in Arlington, in the territory of Pentagon, on the mountains of the National Sepulchre Fayetteville in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorable airplace number 93 of the United Airlines in Shanksville in Pennsylvania.
In the second year, Walmart has $15,000 to purchase and transfer.
Charleen Hunt, 70-year-old, from Westminster, showed that he took the way to Arlington for the number of his husband, a weapon of armed forces.
Because her husband is not held in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said that it was her way to return the victim.
It's a little way to support our units, she said.
It's something like a visiting family grave.
In the grounds of the dark substance, the guaranteers traveled by the greenhouse after travelers and patterns.
The guaranteers took the old tombs of the first and second world war and of the war in Vietnam because they are not visited as often as new tombs.
Nalada was positive when the children played and joined their hands when they traveled young bowls to the flocks.
Each root branch was dark with a small red clothes of the top part.
The nearby § in Section 60, where most veterans are saved from the battle in Iraq and Afganistan, remained really quiet.
The organisations of the services were fulfilled by thousands of winters for the exploitation of the separation, but the exploitation of the shipping wars just fulfilled this area.
Some were truly crying, others prayed, and families and friends stayed each other in a cold air.
Some read the name's voice, spread into stones, while others stoned to look at the small black black names, attached to the smoke of the smoke, where there were not yet been placed by the sepulchre stones.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who lost the slides from the eyes of his son's sepulchre.
She was eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohi to visit the last rest of the Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
Nobody should forget why we're free. My son paid for it, she said.
"And when I was a long time, I want to be the one who would remember him."
American government additives held by Cuban government officers
The Cuban Government held an American government adviser who carried mobile phones and laptops into the country as the officers of the Ministry's border in the Sabbath.
The Advocator, who was not yet identified, worked for the Development Alternatives Inc. with the seat in Bethesda.
The Community works on projects for the United States Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consullar Officers together with the American interest section in Havana searched for access to the arrested prisoner held on 5 December.
Certain accusation was not published, but according to the Cuban law can be a cuban citizen or a foreign prisoned for at least anything that means "in dangerous".
All such contra-revolutionary activity, including peaceful protests and critical states, call the risk of prison.
Protectory graffiti and speakers are considered serious crimes.
In Kuba there is a young blog community, led by the popular commentary of Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and employed by government agents.
Mrs. Sanchez repeatedly requested the authorisation to leave the country to overcome the prices, but the authorisation was rejected.
The holding of the American additive may be the consequence of increased infringement between the Communist Castrov brother, Governing in Cuba, and Obamo's Administration, which was observed as "continuing taktics" when improved relations with the island.
As the first report of the New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy pointed out that if the Cuban Government had a specific steps, such as the exhibition of political prisoners and create more space for obstacles, the companies of the United States are a reciprocal step.
Mobile phones and laptops are authorised in Cuba, although these are new and searched cooties in the country where the average employment of the State employment takes $15 per month.
The Cuban Government has made the general citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used by the majority of text reports, because the 15-minute phone conversation would be more than one day.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in favorite hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to be invited must notify their names to the government.
Access to many web pages is deleted.
The arrest of the Americans in Kuba is an excessive.
Most of the states of the United States in Cuba's prisoners are in charges for the pregnancy of drugs, such as the drug pattern, introduced Gloria Berben, the Section for American interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said he couldn't provide more information about prison.
The prison and arrest was clearly moral.
Such activities that would be legal in each other open company - let's give the free mobile phones - are in Cuba crimes, said Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Programme for Management of Human Rights, which recently published an unexpected report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Dad Kuba", as an advice to install Raula Castra as a ruler of the country and replaced the church of the older brother Fidela.
Vivanco said that the claims often are arrested, judged and prisoned in one day.
He stated that all the solutions would be most political and that the Cuban Government often takes negative reactions in the United States, just when these two countries are directed to the various dialogue.
Pakistan workers, the State Managers, declare the challenge to send men to Afganistan.
The Pakistan authorities on the Sabbath have disappeared the given leader of exploiting five men from the north Virginia to Afghanistan to kill the American units, and they have believed that this case could help to discover the broad network of terrorists who seek the Internet and look for radiakized young men.
The investigators said that they were able to pass after the sixth raising personality, known as Saifuláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after the first discovery, when one of these men published comments, approving terrorist attacks, has a YouTube video page.
Saifillah followed the guidance of these men when they came to Pakistan, trying to help them to get into a remote area of Pakistan in the Paquistán's household of the household of Al-Kydy and its camps for the exploitation of terrorists.
But the Pakistan's officer, who had reported on the case, reported in the Sabbath that Saifuláh was unfortunately successful in the testing of the rulers of Al-Kajdy and that men were not part of the CIA's infiltration to the terrorist network.
Following that, after a few days to the east quarter of Sarghodia, far from the horrible mountains at the north-space, the terrorism was struggled.
They were considered a low unit.
The reason why they were issued, the Officer who spoke to maintain anonymity with regard to the civilization of the case.
The Officer stated that men were not afraid and were still trying to get a agreement for access to the camps of Al-Qaida when they were arrested by the execution of the Pakistan law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was listed to the FBI - has increased the critical role of representatives in identifying potential terrorists, and possibly, what is more important, the definition of those who are confident.
Since 11 September 2001, the United States expert service has made the highest priority to trying to locate human media in Al-Qaida.
Organisms work as a guard, equipped those who are not sufficiently serious in their responsibility to the Holy War and those who could be investigators.
The American false recruits were detailed in the Al-Key special study, they brought an analytical.
However, they were also considered to be extremely interested in the group because in view of their potential access to America's goals and their propagation value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an elder analytical at the NEFA position in the United States, pointed out that the terrorist groups were also more careful in the last years, in which the ability to get to them, because the American officials have received experts on their religious methods.
If we are trying to go to these groups, isn't the best way to walk according to their religious model that has already been monitored?
This model is one of those who are remotely based on the web.
Decades of thousands protested in Kodani, required climate 'action'
Decades of protesters went through the streets of this Sabbath and required more climate actions in the city congress centre of Bella.
Protesters considered the number of statistics of the participants of this event, but the police increases that the number was nearly 25000.
The event was relatively peaceful and steel of massified activists put a number of small investments near the government building groups in the center of the city.
On the day when there was a detailed agreement on climate talks that sponsored the United Nations, thousands of activists traveled through the city and made transparency with English records "This is not the planet B" and one in the Spanish, who called "Zema says 'dost'."
The protest participated in some of the Danish models and photographs of Heleny Christensen, who declared her mother's parents in Peru and gave me information about the unbelievable state of the country in which the change of climate is still involved.
That's a party reason why we decided to connect to this great trial -- to walk through the world and to apply to the leader persons of the world to introduce a righteous, ambitional and serious agreement, she said.
It's not easy, but it's necessary to lead it, it can't still be moved.
The police denied the protestant to approach the center of Bella and told her that she was arrested 19 people, first because they had a massage or had a feet in herself.
These activities are prohibited in accordance with the Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one of the unemployed signs that would not be identified because they are introduced in climate structures, activity masking as sports and in black clothes have set several ranks close to the main channel, which is near a few ministers.
They've been attached to the building, leaving, killing lights, but then followed a few big explosions.
Inside the Congress Center, people were gathered around TV screens to watch the cost during the afternoon.
But Protest probably didn't enter into the knowledge of the key officers, such as Su Wei, the chinese main director of climate.
When he was investigated whether the demonstration had an international action constructive impact, the English answered, "Attually, that is something I was not aware of" (the fact is something I don't know).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Why the story is amazing, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He seeks whether the gain was painful or helped in respect of the views of each one.
It is to see the centre of large public and various sectors and climate changes, he said.
Other words: "It can also say that it is a question of an interruption or freedom of other persons.
The data of the test has rejected the remaining race differences
Federal witnesses from the past week on the achieved wisdom of mathematics were welcomed by the element of good reports on the public school of Columbia.
Although the period is far far from the high-exercision systems of the country, the test has shown greater progress in fourth and eight classs for the last two years than in the cities including Atlantic, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden after the last numbers of the National Assistance Centre for Progress in Learning are overwhelming differences in the achieved knowledge between African and White Students, as well as local and national pages.
The average result of the fourth white requests of Columbia in the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (with 500), but in their African boards only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in the experienced knowledge has actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of the Africans in the eight class remains basically equipped with statistically unsigned one point from 245 to 245.
The average results in the white requests were not attached to the test results because the size of the model was not sufficiently large.
The image in the horizon of six years is not just exciting.
The difference between the white and black eggs of fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the area, was made 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the result of the children in both groups in this period increased, the difference was close to 58.
Some students of education in the course were stated that the results of the secretary of Michelle A. Rhee and an elder Adrian M. Fentym (D) were in the white students of the assembly were stimulated where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we increase the front of the support of those at the top end of the front, which is problem and concernful, said Jeff Smith, the Executive Director D.C. Voices, an unexpected group that covers the equality of education in the area.
The member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth class of basic schools in Etatona.
The criticising style of Mrs. Rhee, Mrs. Brown declared that the report on the results of the test means the average school in the city is in a delicate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the boards and I respect it.
But what's amazing that we didn't have at least no time and energy that was needed to lead to our central school.
Mrs. Rhee said that it was trying to continue to search for the best ways that are involved in the need of students with lower results.
In this case, for example, some students are teachers in use of new reading, Wilson's reading system based on high school students and school students who were not able to control the bases of reading in their colonel carriers.
Each day mathematics and expenditures of mathematics in six classs, increasing games and experiences of real life that have been achieved for the ex-director Clifford Janeyi, can be read at the continuous progress of NAEP, which was given the report last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and implement the best principles of students who remain under the class, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others have stated that the NAEP results have explained whether Mrs. Rhee could continue to increase the full implementation of the system and still provide more money and funds for schools with lower exercise, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a certain dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education in California University in Berkeley where he studys the results of the tests in cities.
The conventional procedure of transport is to measure environments and administrative reforms in schools located in the worst parts of Colombia.
So the purposes may bring political advices that are directed against an important agent.
However, the extent is also to other citizens who are trying to maintain the middle dimension between the White and Black.
We have to go to build a large school system.
We have to use the relatives of our schools so that all families, unless they live, could be able to consider that their children will provide a wonderful public study.
Mr. Janey, now the Newark School Director, introduced in the interview this week, that the basic element of reducing the difference between the successful results is the length of the traditional public year, currently 180 days in the area, to take care of the rightness of school.
You have to get up to 200 days to make sure your changes, Mr. Janey, who concluded the agreement with his membership of the school teachers in 185 days, which is based on the "country" to look for more increase in the next year.
Make higher education part of the better future
The car was entered into Gettysburg's room with a loud dress.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, went out and attempt acted on white columns, cycle fascinates and smaragd green trainers..
Gracielin parents had a high school in El Salvador.
Besides Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never came to the road.
Now she and the other eight classes in the group were studying Gettysburg, where schools did 38690 dollars for year, their position was less than fearing the visitors of the potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Graciela who would like to study the medicine when he offered them to enter the building of science.
Wow, really? She said, "It's amazing when they've given them a lower rate of professors to students."
Pennsylvania's row was one of the seven who visited their classroom, and now they were completely taken in the future message: The question is not whether you enter into the road.
The question is from where.
This is, in particular, a basic problem relating to the high number of children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or high schools as non-yearing, but there are statistics of those who get another education and then enter into the central class.
In fact, the fifth of this "great generation" Spanish requests from the road - observed results show that many of their immigrant parents, the majority of Mexico and the Civil America, were achieved to the United States, unless they had finished the high school.
Their story of success is important, they tell the investigators, because it subtracts their ways before generation that played the role of the role on the field of the field of the employment of the country.
Those who have obtained high school education say that they had a natural post to school and birth-profit and tried to reach.
Many parents also had their children to establish high goals and sought ways to replace an unknown American school.
But the school programmes also play extraordinary role in the help of Graciele and millions of children who would like to solve each other - especially if these experiences survive in time.
If we see that children come from the groups with lower accommodations whose parents have no experience and ability to help them notify in the system, any simple step in each single point, says Patricia Gandar, research in California University in Davis, where students studied from Latin American area.
We have to think about that to give these children a high network in the age of school all ways to travel high school.
The Federal Programme financing Graciely's employment is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP (accounting), provides more than 300 million dollars year for local school systems for the launching other prepared programmes that start for students from a group with small advantages in the middle school and continue until these students do not end up high school.
Since 1999, this programme served more than 10 million students, from which more of the percentage has gone into the road, according to the data of the United States School Minister.
The Iraq Ministry of the Royal Industrial Agreements with 10 frontier shipping companys
Without fear of violence and political instability, the Iraq Government has contributed to a significant major companies to rebuild its sustainable infrastructure during the two Augusts which had been done on the Sabbath.
The Ten Agreement was concluded by the Iraq Ministry of Agricultural Industries with the front-term company, which indicates that Chinese, Russian and European Royal Companies are prepared to play a significant role in the renewing Iraq's role, protected by ten years of war and sanks.
America's companies departed with the capital participation just on two of the 10-year-old fields.
Seven American companies payed for participation in the second August that started at the fifth.
Only one has provided a lost menu.
Two American companies had agreed on the field that was deleted in June.
The great participation of the American grid gigants in the open Iraq round industry has surprised analysis.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of the American companys you have in the first order on the way of Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online report.
It's gonna be long before something else in Iraq is to sell.
Security, excited by massive coordinated bomb attacks in an urgent and political instability, like the loading of American army, probably decline American company from a lot of intensive business in Iraq, which is providing the third largest surrounding reserves, says an analysis.
The American companies were in some cases of disagreement, especially Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly smaller operation costs and are more vulnerable to risk because they do not correspond to actors.
The Exxon Mobil and West Petroleum Inc. were the only American company that had concluded agreements with the Ministry.
Former American company, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who had maintained close contacts with the Iraq Ministry of Royal Industries and offered technical assistance in the past years, departed with empty hands.
The Russian company of Lukoil and Gazprom were a major actionary in two of the contracts that were added to the end of this week.
The State Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and departed with large parts in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China encourages this to become the main economic, as the technological force, said the speaker of the Ministry of the Royal Industries of Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be compared to the competition and will achieve its obligations against Iraq.
Communitys which were previously chosen for the transfer of offers, which were then compared to the Ministry in accordance with the price of the branch and the Ministry is to pay for the expenditure on the current level on each policy.
The Spanish Planner Al-Khai, of course, was killed in Pakistan.
At the event of American rackets at the border between Pakistan and Afganistan in this week, it was obviously killed a pipe planner of operational al-Kydy, as announced in the fifth of the American anti-terralistic division.
As it was confirmed, it could be a second death attack on one of the highest leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Sumali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rackets had fallen on their cars near Miran Sah in the north Vasistan province, according to the American resources and the Pakistan officers in the area.
The local authorities claimed that the rackets were cut off from the air without a type of type operating by the CIA in the phase of unlawful homelands.
You were led to a white car that was directed to the Afghan border when he was attached, and the officer brought together with a Pakistan citizen cycle detective agent who called from Miran Shah.
The Officer stated that the local weapons were attached to the point and quickly happy, which remained from the "all destroyed body".
The local offices were not able to verify the identity of the victim, but two American officers of the anti-terralistic distribution quoted the unspecified witness that said that Somali was after death.
Somali was designed as a high-based military planner of the Al-Kajdy, which led the operations of the terrorist groups outside the region of Afganistan and Pakistan.
He was intended to reach all the world, and he said the higher officer who would not be named, who had considered a civilized consideration of the American aircrafts in the field of Pakistan.
If he remained such a central position, he was probably entrusted in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from Al-Kajdy's highest leader and planned potential terrorist attacks.
Another American officer said that Somali had progressed quickly in the al-Kajdy hierarchie and was well linked to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a generally known person for some Americans, but he didn't have any way to invite us and our connections, he said another officer.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second higher officer of Al-Kaidy or Taliban who should be killed from September when the same attack was killed Naimmudin Jalolov, the leader of the military fraction in the board of the households and three other superperative leaders.
The time of CIA's attacks started using non-pilot airlines has been reduced from average six operations for two months, according to the records of the Long War journal, web pages, controlled by the non-sex group.
The reduction may have a reason for the improved terrorist groups that have made steps to restrict their ransomness because they also have killed persons in which they were understood that they were informants.
The delegate of the United Nations in Kabul has gone away.
The Victoria Delegation of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, introduced on Friday, that he wanted to go out of his function in March and finish so strong functional periods that had been committed with a diverse corruption in the election of President in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
In Eide, the administrative Obamova has decided to send more 30000 American soldiers to Afghanistan.
The Delegator of the United Nations declared that he supported the growth, but declared concern that the United States' time scheme for reducing the state which begins for 18 months should be called for the governments of the ONTO to load its powers.
We need to accelerate the construction of African security forces and send this correct signal to Africans who have confidence in the international community, introduced Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The accepted commitment must be long.
Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil employees assistance to the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The weapons on the side of weapons must be copied on the side of civilists, said.
Eide said that it wasn't rejected, but it was just full of promises that gave his family in March 2008 that it was only two years in Kabula.
He showed that he wanted to give the report of the United Nations.
The General Secretary Ban Ki-moon now showed that he needed time to find replacement.
As I said, it's the highest time to look at the follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my leader and my coming.
According to the Officers of the United Nations Ban started searching for replacement.
The Officers concluded that it was decided between Staffan di Mistura, who has a Switzerland-Italian origin and has led the United Nations mission in Bagdad and Jean-Maria Guehenn, France, which has led the peace operation of the United Nations.
It was tested after his previous representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzaam, who gathered in land president's options with massive choice machines.
Eyde denied this statement, but he stated that Galgraitha's offence was released -- "It was sure the mission, because there was a high degree of the ship with the international interest" in the choice.
Eide suggested that he proposed a meeting with the highest member of the citizens because of the coordination of the department of efforts in the United States force in Afganistan.
He also urged the United Nations leaders to allow more employees from the United States and other West countries that would apply them for a African mission, so as he said, he would like to send their confidence that their money is correctly required.
Eyde declared the declaration of the restrictions of its efforts in Afghanistan and declared that the serious Regulation of the United Nations on the occasion of recognition of its capacity.
The rules of the United Nations are that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a catastrophe and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran is the other sanctuary
The Minister of Protection Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers are soon influenced on Iran 'the more significant sanction' because of the unrequiredness in conversation about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in North Iraq during a weekly way of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, baptized the views of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the question of the soldier to the probable development.’
One of the things that are concerned with me is whether I learned about something from Iraq for the last six years, [that] is an increasing invisibility in the war.
The administrative assessment is decided at the sanctuary package that could ensure the Iran military and political elite, but Gates signed that some of these sanctions could also be moved to the normal Iran.
He said that "the ball of offers and branches" would be required to "to take the Iran government to really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "their citizens will be immediately sustained" sanctions.
According to the fifth opinion, the officer of the White House Robert Gibbs, the European leader had given a warning that Iran would bring serious consequences if his nuclear programme does not lead to the full agreement with the United Nations Economic Security Committee and its monitoring authority, the International Agency for Atom Energy.
Iran still wants to develop his famous knowledge only for peacekeeping purposes.
At the discussions in Geneva 1 October, he stated that he wanted to return to the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and agreed that the essential part of his restricted uranium was provided for the reactor for the implementation of medical research.
The Administrative was based on such a agreement as a means of entrusting confidence between both parties and to get time for operation.
But from that time, Iran seems to be disappeared from the provisional agreements - partly, the representative, because the Irish leadership is divided in views of whether it is affected in the United States.
In particular, if Iran's sustainability to the international community in the case of some proposals that have actually agreed at the beginning of October, I believe that it has been brought to the international community, including Russians and Chinas together on the road that is not on the termology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama established the final term for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before he returns to search for other choices including monitoring, which Hillary Rodham Clinton had called "degrading sanctions".
In the opinion published in New York, the Iranian mission in the United Nations denied in the fourth part of what was called "required and unsubmitted obligations" before some members of the Iran Security Committee on nuclear activities and stated that he wanted to continue conversation with the United States and five other world-wide powers " for the adoption of a long-term decision.
Gates, who returned to Washington last fifth, was meeting with the Iraki Ministry President Nouri al-Maliki before he went to Curdistan, rich on robe to meet the soldiers in Kirku and the Kurdian representatives in Irbil.
It survives highly injury between Kurd and the Arab Arabic, especially because of the limits, own rights and the distribution of receipts.
Gtes had both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to refuse the United States plans to limit the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to cut the curd concern from the overriding depression. The official location of the United States cited Gates when he shared Massud Barzaanym, President of the Curdistán regional government: "We want to protect your safety, prosperity and autonomia in the convention of Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In Chinese Saturday, change of the curses
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown around propagandist plaquets that they read that "Mother of the Earth is too excited to use more children" and "It is only a child meaning one more tomb."
Then the lectures received that when the official government location in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth and loading the population in their city, it changed the course in this year and began strengthening young couples, their reaction was immediately and decisive: Never.
We've always wind all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't leave anything for the other, says Wang, 31 years old, manner of human resources, who has 8 months son.
For more than 30 years China's policy had only one child, and that was created only two generations of nottorically built and lost children, infectedly overseased "little Caesars", the country increases the population crisis.
The average parent has increased 1,8 children in a couple in comparison with six before the policy has entered into the entirety of the United Nations data.
The division of the population in which the number of citizens in the age of 60 and higher is predicted that 16,7% of the population in 2020 to 31,1% in 2050 is far over the total average of 20%.
It is not equal to the larger rich towns of the population with high school education, for example in Shanghai.
Loni people in 60 years old and higher created at least 22% of the registered citizens in Shanghai, while birthday was less than one child on a couple.
Xie Lingli, Chairman of the Shanghai City Commission for the population and the planning of the family said that many couples must have children to "aid to reduce the proportion of the population and reduce the number of work forces in the future."
He says that it's about "the old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in the outcome countries, like Japan or Sweden."
Advanced relaxation
As it was placed in the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is likely to be the most controlled mandate led to the communist governments.
The two girls who disrupted the policy were achieved to the increasing trials -- until the treasure of their annual payment in some areas -- and discrimination in work.
The Chinese official places have established a political policy that has helped the country to protect the critical corruption of natural resources, while human rights have been rejected during the proceedings of policy.
In the foreign areas, some officers took a lot of women in the second child to make care of them.
Moreover, many couples had to submit sexually choices, leading to unprofitly highness of men against women.
In the past years, the population officers were increasingly closer in their opinion to a child's policy.
In 2004, the reviews called the extent of exemptions - including citizens, national members of minority and cases when men and women were the only ones -- and in 2007 they mixed the dick of their passwords that were low-line.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor of the Popular Research Institute of Peking University, said that the central governments have already discussed radically changes, such as the allowance of couples to have two children if one of the partners was the only one.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city, which was exploring a aggressive campaign for more generations.
During the night, the plots were offering parents to have only one child, replaced by the copies of the Regulation, detailed by detailed descriptions as to have a second child and asking for authorisation.
The city management sent officers for the planning of families and friends to meet parks in their houses and drive airports under the door.
They also promised to provide citizens and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was hungry, they led the officers to the family planning.
Short reception
Although the officers in one foreign town in Shanghai reported the increase of interest in two people who wanted to have a second child after the campaign started, most cities have not reported changes.
The city period of Huinan with 115000 population, for example, recorded four to five cases per month.
The officers in Shanghai said that the number of born in the town in 2010 was still expected only about 165000 - increasingly higher in 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, leader of the family planning in the Shanghai Fourth Caolu, pointed out that financial impacts were likely for the reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to give it to the best of the first child, he brought it.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like two children and was legally allowed to them.
But as many Chinese people who have only unrequired health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a doctrine occupied network, the choice may be unreasonable.
People on the west have the policy of one child as a sport legal question, says Yang, a staff engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of integrity in the dream with the first child.
Yeah, we were able to have more than one kid.
But the problem is not just in the policy.
It's about money.
Other parks make psychological reasons for courage.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says that they want only one child because she was the only one who said, "We were in the middle of our families and we were all watching us.
We didn't have been used to offer a penalty and, in fact, we did not want to take care of the other.
Chen Sieian, 42 years old, whose legal translation company, has expressed much more increasingly.
For two carrier parents from the middle class that decreased the parent, he said to be successful to be sober.
Today, 20 and 30 years remaining look at parents as the first day of China's experience with capitalism and do not want this way to live for themselves, says.
Just one child gives a lot of requirements for parents, says.
Mother must offer at least two years of his society life.
Then there are still severe questions of the area -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume prepared in the time when you're nine months for good school education.
Most of his friends want to be happy with one kid, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher animal standards, he says.
We don't want to offer too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group raised a plan to reduce emissions.
The United Nations sponsored conference on climate -- characterized in the unexpected positions and others, was replaced in the fourth, to the release of a document proposed by ambitional reduction of the quantities of the flows in the next 40 years with the industrialized nations, which are increasingly increasingly in the nearest term.
The text that can provide the East for the final political agreement on the regulation of the floor planes, indicates the remaining transactions as the light of the path before.
But it was important to see a progress in actions that had been incorrect time with more than 100 world leaders who would come to the Code next week.
The United Nations Working Group ad hoc, this text will incidentally indicate how much money the rich countries should provide to those poor to be raised with the global encoding of shortage and long-term.
And provides the entire palette of choices for key questions, including how to develop and control the achievement of the economys to limit their output of carbon and what should be the highest limit of global temperatures that will still be tolerable tolerant policies.
This will add a major dose flexibility process, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington Club of Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, was designed from 180 pages of text to operate on what the Short Officer on climate issues in the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great image".
It provides the conditions for the possible agreement in which industry nations could joint limit their emissions to 25 to 45 per cent in comparison with 1990 levels, while the principal developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 per cent.
The country will reduce emissions to 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union has proceeded quickly in the fifth of the promise that it provides $3,6 billion during the next three years to help the poor countries to accept climate changes - from the control of the plans and the shoes until the refugee.
But on the fifth day, he made the same type of branches that had been considered during the conversation in the past week.
The United States Special Mission for Climate Questions Todd Stern refused the word, requireing a serious restrictions of emissions for industry countries in comparison with goodwills in main developing economys if they were not financed by the developing world.
The position signed that Obamova's Administration had made a serious line against China as the officers of the Busho's administrative just two years ago.
The United States will not apply to the Treaty without transmission of main developing countries and actions, and the Star, who also suggested that the text is not sufficient to ensure limits and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment on the hour after the Chinese Ministry of the border He Yafei shared the United States' headquarters of climate issues that there is no "self understanding" or "marginal responsibility" in the week ago to communicate that the United States would not be financially helped to China to achieve it with global implementation.
With the future economic ways of the main world powers in the area, the tahanes like within the development world, as well as between the industrial world and the development of economics.
The current war is intended to maintain individual economy less than the maintenance of the planet, between China and the United States, in respect of the implementation of their competent obligations, while the poor nations notice that two decades of the most influential countries of the world ignore scientific imperatives for implementing more significant actions.
Ricardo Ulate, Delegation of Costaky, said that it is not surprising that the main powers fight about who should take costs for the limits of the floor planes, while the rare lands were more aggressive in search of the law to take great emissions responsible for their actions.
It is clear that new economic hegemonies are developed, says Ulate, which also serves as regional advice in the areas of regional climate changes in Mexico and the Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries who are the most rare impact of climate changes indicated that they wanted to continue in the implementation of legally serious agreements in Codean, but most of the major participants said that the best result of the discussion would be the political agreement.
Aliance of small island States who have 43 members have established the 24-side proposal of the end of the fourth morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate actions in the use of the European Commission, said that the proceeding from the parts of the small island nations "involved political pressure on the whole political process" partially because they are now joints and required activity from growing economics such as China and India.
The operation was called a new poverty when the delegated delegates had considered the fact that the majority of remaining sport questions should be resolved before the Government's heads exceeded the agreement.
High positions of the officers, such as the Indian Minister of Environmental Protection of Jairam Rameš and the Chinese Ministry, went out from the airport and traveled by the Bella center to closed doors of meetings and new conferences so that they could exceed the proceedings that will be set up in the next week.
Simply availability of the meeting - when 13000 people were transferred each day from and to the Congress Centre, the cytars playing activity incentives in the night in the surrounding views of the countries who thought they were sent, and were made to transmit proposals from the hands to the paper at the same time than the electronic mail controlled.
Intensity is only a setting: in the Codean, at least all the key ministers and previously in the middle of 60 States heads.
We arrived in high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the Minister of Global Policies in international nature protection.
They're coming hard weights.
The British first floor with speed 140 miles per hour predefined this morning
on 5:13 on Monday, the star spent the darkness to the sign of the ship, which signed the revolution of transport in the United Kingdom.
The first high-speed port in the country will get speed 140 miles per hour and flight from Ashford in Kentu to London St. Pancras and perform a distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then he was connected to Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered into the first high-speed personal preparation outside LLndine.
It hopes that the new service is incidentally connected to the United Kingdom with the international networks of fast, joined balls and associated with the great Midland, north and Scotland with London.
The restricted waters should be reduced by the transport time in personal reviews and on trade routes and transport from airports and vehicles to the fertilization could reduce the emissment of the air and elimimine the smokes on motors.
Theoretically, three main political sides have been allowed to get for this view.
But ten of the libraries needed to build a new national fertilization network, an unresolved battle on projects and fear of environmental distortion has now been attached to the building of British high-speed treatments.
High Speed Two (HS2), the company created in January to provide Government a realistic study, presented his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as introduced Timesy.
He gave him a detailed map after the second planned ship of high speed network.
The new transaction of London with the West Midland was proposed to five meters in cities and fourth areas where life media could be difficult.
The open country was planned to 25 m final travel.
HS2 is also proposed to determine three options for a high-speed network leading on the north.
Lord Adonis will respond to the egg.
The preliminary choice is the control of the face of the Y letter, when one high speed should be carried into the West Midland.
It should be divided near Birmingham with a wind from Pennines to Manchester and Scozia and the other leader to Sheffield, Leedsu and Newcastle over Tyne.
One of them should go to Scotland.
"It seems that it happened to the best choice," he said and the famous ring.
As soon as it's done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be short for two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage that will not be opened before 2025 could allow a traveling travel between London and Birmingham for 49 minutes in comparison with more than one hour in the present.
The proposals should allow flowers to drive speed 2250 miles per hour, which would be done from the British network quickly in Europe.
The starting trace is already proposed to be able to transform 1100 persons in the length of 400 m .
Even 18 reviews could be operated every hour at the London - Birmingham train.
It means that the London terminal would be able to serve in the case of the need to be 20 000 traveling for hours.
In view of the capital limits, the existing stages would be expanded in order to take a high speed network.
The experts of the fertilization industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis notes whether it is less or not to perform this scheme, but the extent of public consultations and planning procedures means that, although the final decision does not occur before all options.
Even if he brings the round to move, the network should be built by parts.
The flights should first be carried out not on high-speed tractions, but already existing traits from the north from Birmingham and maintain the driving time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is based on the decision-making steel point to ensure the transition from the aircraft, the orientation point for the revolution of the fertilization.
Financial populators offered hypothesis in 75000 libs to the Orange of the Touris
Alan Duncan, maintained the primary seat lavies of the Touris in the sending dreams, offered the payment of thousands of books of costs last year for the orangery that he built in his house in the choice.
Talking sides for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron, because he had suffered that the messengers lived "of the advantages," increased their hypothesis for 75000 liter to build a duration based extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account a special interest, a total of hundreds of books for a month of payment employees.
The current authorities have approved the proposals during the time and then not heard by Sir Thomasen Lex, who carried the control of the Members' expenditures. The last night Mr. Duncan told his requests "It could be cleaner or easier."
Mr. Duncan, one of the most poor members of the Parliament, the two own houses in your choice in the Rutland and Melton.
The houses have a value at about a million books.
In the field is a cook, a resident room and food, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
The last year he added to the house of the winter garden, which is marked in the plans as "orangery".
The companies describe it as a "shirt for happy and happy."
Mr. Duncan was not requested to explain a statement to the extent of the final control of the Committee for the general standards and privileges in the last comparison of the hypothesis.
The Committee gave him the past month that he disappeared the rules after the investigation of his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the public security of hypothesis in the highest 271406 books from his mate in London to house in his choice, which was purchased in 1991, a year before it became a member of a sentence.
The documents that were released this week showed that Mr. Duncan was cut off at about 1400 libraries monthly in the interest of the hypothesis until March to March of the Lonning Year.
In April, his ideas increased over 1800 libres per month.
The RBS hypothesis of Mr. Duncana could not be changed in this time, which means that all of this was determined to finance the payment in 75000 library.
The standard RBS variation rate of the hypothesis was decreased in 2007 from 7,94 per cent of 4 per cent in March of this year, where it remained.
The last document of the public authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to reach 1250 lib per month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his work as a train leader in September after one of her secret reviews infiltrated and said that the messengers must survive "in the target" after the scenario with the expenditure.
"In the principle it is recognised, you have to live on the target and come with you as with s*t."
He said, "I lost the money for my garden and my hair and a little smoke for what I needed.
And I could make all the fucking part, but I don't do it."
The messenger, a billion of ancient carrier, was first invited to explain his issue in May when it was shown that he had gained thousands of books for his garden, still before approval of the financial office that it could be "reasoned."
One of the activists cut a graph in the face of the book mark in Mr. Duncana's trainer at the protest after that he was deceived that he broke 4000 liters for three years.
When the last night was asked to increase the hypothesis, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the higher capital, which was approved as a financial office, as follows as Lex."
He added: "This is not a stressful question of protecting and clicking or disrupting rules or anything else.
It's absolutely equal line bottom, according to the rules, corrected, and it's all.
It wouldn't be able to be much more cleaner or easier."

Brighton is such a fantastic creative and nice place, and we tried to try and present this spiritual way."

The subjects of the landscape and the story will be strengthened in the framework of the reforms of the universe dignity, reported by Chatel.
The Ministry of School Luc Chatel introduced on weekly during the conversation for the JDD magazine that the targets and agriculture will be in the framework of the reforms of the global exploitation "forwarded", although their investigation will be no longer in the last year of the exacerbious science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and all will be the same program from the global culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the Ministry "It's supposed to be done with consciousness" because the specialization of S is not already intended to exact sciences, but "the best students are in it."
Specifications EC and L can't be with any sub-specialism, continues and advertises: "I have not heard many history and intellectuals that would be able to make surprise that in the last year of delicate ranges of lands and story."
The Expop Agency Research, which published in the Sabbath, showed that seven Frances from 10 (69%) does not agree with the Government project to avoid the responsible exemptions of history and agriculture in maturity annual specialization with S, and so many intellectual and teachers criticized this disruption, as well as the left, and some of the right messengers.
The Ministry also added that "not in mind" can interrupt philosophy in the specialization program of the Maturity Year.
Luc Chatel also entrusted the reform in education, while 16 organizations (students and offices) were invited to participate in the outer mobilisation against this project which offers pedagogical education of future professors.
In the framework of Master Study 2 (M2), the first year of the year accepting tests will be subject to their operations and, at the end of the year, another investigation that confirms their capacity, explained the Ministry.
In the second year of master studies, the participant stages will be raised as a teacher-stage professor before the first year.
If you calculate all versions that will be offered to you before the approved management, you will receive more experiences with eggs, at least 300 hours, continued.
The Ministry also announced that he would propose "the personal law for education" which still does not exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project for a breakdown of school maps until 2012.
In the Elit University, Ecole normal suerries have 15 minutes to overwhelm climate.
Fifty-minute minutes for the presentation of the code-sum objectives: this is the call that he announced in the meeting on the morning, Jean Jouzel, more President of the Intergovernmental Government Department Group for Climate Development (GIEC) to provide the University of Ecole normal sumure on the Ulm Street.
As one AFP newspaper reported, the Laureat Nobel's price of peace Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Conference "Ernest", which is a single seminar based on the 15-minute advice of experts that will be attached and opened.
We wanted to do something that would happen to people, and on the basis of what they should be more desired to learn more, he explained at the opportunity of Conference 22, Edouard Hanneso, one of the organizators of this seminars, who received the name according to the fishing of the local ship, which the students thus called.
It is likely to choose twenty employees of individual scientists and noticed that the choice is based on their charism.
"We can talk for hours, but we can also share the basic targets for a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before a fifty hearers without ready notes, only by using the graphs.
It's part of our scientist work, he showed the hope that the listeners know that "the code-conference is very seriously prepared by scientists."
Videos on these proposals will be placed on the school from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned on February and the other will follow regularity each two months.
Retard in payments: exploitation of surveillance in prisons, planned measures
The officers of prison observers were notified in the week "all mobilisation" because they require them to be applied to the feast celebrations and the transition of the prizes which the branch was made for financial reasons on the air.
The Federal FO (2. Sections of Observatory) requested employment that would not have a service to participate in the demonstration on the morning before prison devices and to "lock them" and to warn them as well as to "their cities".
The CGT for the prisoner (3. Sections of this sector) was invited to "proclaim meetings in individual prisoners and to start fundamental mobilization" with that "sight and inacceptable", to "the time and payments for work in night, weeks and feasts" deployed in October, not have been burned in prosin.
First officers, the Federal Union of prisoners (Ufap/Unsa), "proclaims to complete mobilisation (...) with the purpose of demonstration of disagreement and disagreement."
The Government Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of transitional times has increased in 2009 and not all have been attached to the financial budget but ensures that the debt parts will be carried out in January.
The office has shown at the end of the day that Michelle Alliot-Mario has sent to the officers of prison officers, in which it ensures that the payment will be carried out in the next month.
I know the efforts that the prisoner is based on ensuring the functioning and modernization of our prison system writes in his communication.
I have appointed the Administrative Directorate of the prison to adopt immediate measures to take the situation that has taken a bad number of transits, which have never re-packed in the future, has added the Ministry Alliot-Mario.
The prosinc rod will then be low, with exclusive employees managers who get a honourable pressure for the implementation of the function and the implementation of the targets, introduces Ufap/Unsa, and for you, "in the budget will always be located."
It's just a skandal, it's been disappointed by the interregional FO Union in Marseille, and she announced her decision to fight "all meetings and preconference".
Workers will not come to work on week or party, if their payments for these days from October will not be placed in prosincy, as well as in the pasts, are also threatened by FO Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne.
In the time they give us more jobs and more tasks without that they would give us another person, it is hard to allow you to pay the less employee's officer's officers in Bordeaux.
According to the debates, there is no similar situation in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in each case of financial measures, he was the general secretary of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
Both says that he gives "better gifts" than those who reach.
The American President Barack Obama, who is prepared for his first conference with the family in the White House, has checked the "bohyni" screen of Oprah Winfrey, that it is a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The President and his wife Michelle talked in a special order, which will be sent to the ABC staff on the evening on the way they can be able to build the feasts and the end of the year in their new and prestigious lives.
Even Bo, a small fourth member of the family will get his share.
Jesus loves Boa, said Michelle Obam, that the pearls also "surely" will receive gifts, as he describes from the animals from the former sentence of the order.
And Michelle Obam also threatened against his man to the quality of gifts that reached: "I'm sure not, I gave you the first gift," she was thrown up the president.
Well, of course, it's true, it was urgent to agree with the President, but immediately afterward, he showed a presence on the Perl's first lady, "Who gave you this?"
At this week, a very free arrangement with the glorious moderator, who courageously supported Baracka Obama in his president campaign, also spoke to Obam's husbands about their unworthy gifts that were obtained as children.
Barack Obama led a round with ten degrees, but also the basketball shield, who bought him on his Kenya's father's feast, with which he meeted only a very stripper.
I remember how I saw my father who came to see us at the office, and how the basketball sword gave me, he told the President.
So long, I realized that he really gave me the sword.
The first lady reminded you of the house for the girls.

Francouz Frédérick Bousquet, a triangle medicine on the world mystery in 2009, received in a large base in the fourth quarter of the European mystery of 2009 in a small area in Istanbul, which is particularly liked: 50 m free way.

One of them convinced the Hungarian Leader Evelyn Verrast for 200 m meters of position and two remaining Russian steafe to 4x50 m position.
The big deal for Bousquet, which made a global record of 50 m free way, which is already a maintainer in a large base (20,94).
In one of the two king disciplines, 50 metres of free way, Francouz won 28 years old, with a final time 20,53 seconds in the final, on which ten boards were started in place of normal eight.
Bousquet struck Chorvata Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russian Sergey Fesikova (20,84), but he was not able to convince the world record (20.30), as he thought.
We can always sleep about something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my achievement, I'll try about it.

Combines have been recommended from February 2008 to 238 world records and their age ends in Istanbul, which is as the first hostil in 1999 in the same challenges.
The use of combinations this time has not helped German Paul Bidermann, a double-compliant teacher of the world in a large area in Rome, which had the world record for the dose of hands.

I didn't give everything to that office.
I knew that this time I wouldn't pronounce the world record, but I've been able to make my title, and I've done my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious support to the future, explained Biedermann.

The UDF meeting increases the tone and calls the New Centre to continue to use their shortcut.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, reacted on the trial of the President of the New Centre, the Great Morina, on the property of the shortcuts of the old Giscardo's parties, with that shortcut should not be used in no medium under a grid of crime.
Heroi Morin publicly announced his purpose to adjust the UDF shortcut with that Francois Bayrou does not allow her inheritance after he delivered the left hand.
The Ministry of Defence, which is the UMP partner, had to confirm this strategy on the Sabbath before the National Court of New Centre (NC).
This step has received support to the apostol Herveo de Charetta (ex-UMP now for NC), which is attached to the UDF characteristics because it was the first for registering it in 2004 in the National Institute of Industrial Proprietary (l' Institute National de la Proprietary Industrial).
But on the fifth evening, the Committee of the UDF officers Françoise Bayroua, who do not want to be able to provoke, went out from his mood and gave the formal request of Minister and the apostles to stop use the shortcut and to replace the property of protection marks, under the several disagreement of crime.
In the last days, you have increased a worried statement that you will propose your political step + again override + UDF shortcut, write the Board in your letter signed 19 of 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoD or Senator Jean Arthus from Alliance Centriste.
You also thought that you were appropriate to locate your propaganda materials and the visiting web page of your name+New Centre+, with the column +UDF today+, are also signers of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, the UDF committee that requests the NC's extent to remove all the names of UDF from all propagation materials, including the Internet pages."
He also requests Herve de Charette to provide the property of the property of the legal properties.
If you do not, we will turn to the court to respect the law and the legal rights of the UDF members, to warn the signals.
In their letters, the UDF " is a full political challenge of 1978 " and notes that Mr. Morin and his friends have chosen " department in 2007 " to create competition, as well as others in 2002 to establish UMP.
The New Centre has therefore no right to use the UDF shortcut (the Union for the French democracy).
They also remind that the UDF Congress has voted in 2007 to connect to MoD for three years and to create a "moral and material interest" committee based on Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
What is about Hervo de Charette, the Committee continues to continue when he recorded a protection mark, "the three years of the UDF member," but the UMP.
Scanical and consistently used acronym registration not existing to do so on its own account.
This independence begins to change in criminal acts, they pronounce, and then the ironians express to the NC strategy: "It seems to be as a policy, so in a regular life it is more worth to create a name for themselves than to get out of anonymous advocate name on which we have no right."

Liliane Bettencourt always rejected that it would be a photograph that considers a long friend.
While the Court had to judge the right of the accusation given by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Fifth Court of Auditors had changed a minute in a family hour of truth.
A lawyer Liliany Bettencourt submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to his notebooks, and in which he declared his infidelity to his husband Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt adds: "You could explain my daughter that I wrote to Banniro for 15 years to two times a day.
From that time, I couldn't talk to Françoise."
The State Agreement in Nanterre revealed that the operation of the traitors was not authorised, more than that the optical court in those days rejected her request to be initiated to deliver law protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully able to participate in the court, not under protection or in care.
Nobody else will do for her," confirmed the procurture representative, Mary-Christine Daubigney.
The Court finally decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers will be expressed during the start of the process.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companys, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was too...
For more than 10 years, it reminds the management of large companies with the employee access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to match cooperators with the "recommendations" defined from the time when they had to be used to use products that have resulted out of the ideas of the business technology.
While the register was a company center, the marketing revolution of the marketing strategy on the right direction... and when the authorization trials to income the products, different from the customer preferences, they are regularly returned!
The passive access of employees can lead to death democracy.
Several murders in the companys of France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a wide part of the larger global phenomenon that contains overwhelming management chains.
This demobilization affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
And in fact, the EI "requests all participated parties (...) active access and capacity" and requires the obligatory employees that are totally in contrast with the acceptance of the authorised management.
Therefore, we call to a managing revolution that should bring workers to the business centre as well as the client.
Relative use of internal investigations of public measures.
Internal investigation of public detention - as a questionnaire for Orange's employees - support the revolution in the manager procedures?
I'm afraid there's nothing.
First because I've already convinced that the face in the face of the new situation is the structure after the various disagreements returns to the... what she always did!
In addition, the Authority, as one of the potential patologies, is exceeding the duties of its own success.
And finally, because most of the employees have an integrated view of human behavior.
Because they are high schools for ingegners, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the reason of thinking agreements, an older behaviorristic theory, the renewed "neuro sciences" from the United States and largerly widely without the knowledge of scientists and media.
With the possibility of "pays" (sic) introduction of managers, Ipsos Agency has shown a recent investigation on Figaro.fr pages, which only establishs the managers in their mechanical management position, inadequate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors.
Furthermore, the manager revolution is necessary for the correct functioning of modern undertakings, suggested to accept the final visa of human behavior.
It shall be concluded in the implementation of the basic section in all objectives and practices of management: For business, the obligations for the business will be possible only if they are able to go as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambition and projects.
In the present time, the conceptions of the employees are only occupied by the Motivative functional analysis.
These studies showed that the value of their companies based on the basis of the specific dox that allows them through the image of the company, which provides for them to do their live objectives.
The identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization can control, prevention and anticipation on their "social outcomes" and introduce their human resource management "to the right path".
This creates a life-wide development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
I'm out of Osla, 'the righteous war', Obama served the glory from the right side.
The American right in the fifth stated that Barack Obama had submitted the day before in Osla, with satisfaction that the holder of Nobel's price for 2009 had prohibited the concept of "the righteous war" against the enemies of the United States.
Concerts, who were first examining the price to Obam on 9 October, this time pressed the president's statement, including Sarah Palin, the former candidates for Vice-President in options in 2008.
I liked what he said, Palin, the Museo of the Right Republic Club, for the United States Today, and added that she was alone to this theme "also needful" war in her memorys that are just out.
Of course, the war is the last thing that the Americans want to have to work, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to keep there, it's interesting.
President Obama, who held two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his presidentGeorge W. Bush, in the fourth century in Oslu, justified the power to send out his decision to send other 30 000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before.
Next Obama's adversarior, Newt Gingrich, agreed that the President had taken a "best good job" in Osla.
I think that the demonstration was really very good, well-hearted by the former President of the Representatives, who appreciated the President's meaning of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my way I considered this show as a whole history, Gingrich reported during the conversation in the "The Takeaway".
The messenger, which some considered the potential of the Republic candidate in the President elections for 2012, was surprised that the "Levic President" seemed to remind the members of the Nobel Price, that they would not be free and could not provide the price for peace if the use of power would not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, the former author of George W. Bush, now the editor of Washington Post, Obama predicted "the very American show".
He was not only as a "storm" as always, but "He spoke as American President" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble that they didn't create themselves, and that they do not too much for them to keep it."
In the middle of a few few disagreements from the right line are the Busho Eries, an old officer in the United Nations John Bolton, which indicated as "unincremental, embarrassed and without inspiration", as he introduced on the National Review Online websites .
Left from the President, for example, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is grateful in view of Baracka Obama, justifying the use of power.
"When we struck the war into the guard of justice, we can easily cause the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the Middle-Left Press continues to be an exciting opinion against the President.
Although Los Angeles Times and continues to consider the price of peace to Obam for the time, he agreed his expenditure as a "requirement" and it also for the speaker who was known by his talent.
The show from Osla should serve as a guidance to international decisions in conflict resolutions, in battle with poverty and distress," the Californian journal.
Obama, "the show of what it was necessary," determined the New York Times, and the demonstration marked "for simple and teaching."
Structural transporter: three maratons to the agreement that will save the additive for the Wednesday.
After three marathons, the officers of motor transporters and TLF, the only employee organization remained until the end, on the evening evening to the agreement, which concluded the call to the staff and the grave, which had regarded the additional procedure on Western.
The State Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on the fifteen signing of the Agreement, expressed "happiness" and after several issues that started in the middle of the morning.
After the second night, the officers were discussed at the fifth morning with hope that the agreement will be signed as fast as soon as later.
And yet, three employees organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) departed from the operation.
But there was more than six hours of meeting that began at 11 hours to agree and sign the agreement in 18 hours.
This conflict "will be very harmful to the companies" and "the danger of the celebrations on the end of the year" reported Bussereau.
The text indication contains the increase of the border of 4% in the lower payments (in local and regional motor transport) and 2,9% in the highest payments (in international transport).
The time rate of the lower payments is increased from 8,72 € to 9.06.
It's not a lot, but it's a lot of efforts, explained Patrick Clos (FO).
Tonight, we give our members the command that they don't get to blocks, no blocks of the staff centre.
But there can be a few other reliefs who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, stated "the correct agreement," even when it was difficult to recognize the increase of high payments in respect of the international cohesion. "
Following him, it will increase 170 euros monthly in the lower middle and 100 to 120 euros at the highest.
It is about the health agreement and respect for the employees, proclaimed CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) announced "historical Agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), "avoidable compromise."
The Agreement also provides the revalidation of travel expenditures in over 3% and report on the situation of motor transport in the first half of 2010, which also allows to take place on the question of 13 and modernization of the collective Treaty.
Bussereau recalled "the reduction of 100 million euros on the data from the officers" which was the subject of the amendment proposed by the Government to propose the proposal of the budget for 2009, which was voted on the fourth night at the Pentecost of the National Conference.
The Government requests the Senat of "acceptable" vote.
The signature allows that this Agreement will be addressed first to the companies that are members of this organization, later to the full operation, in the case of the Ministry's extension.
"In the shortest term," confirmed Bussereau.
The entire process can only cut off the non-compliance of the organization of employees.
The FNTR organization is talking about the "failure" because 100 million eur "the sector has been offered in the framework of compensation of the parts of the carbon data".
The State Secretary for Transport has used us to do noise in the consequence of an analysis of each other, but it is because of not developing crowds in the nearby feasts, UNOSTRA.
For the organization of Father's worried that the agreement in the next 12 months "seats a large number of small and central companies from the campaign."
REER A: interruption of weekly transport, departments are not concerned with the proposal of the RATP transport undertakings.
The interruption of the transport on the line of REER A, which is the largest link of the largest citizenship transport in France, will continue even during a week, because the fifty treatment between the officers and the RETP's second day has not been brought to any specific results in the pressing question.
In the Sabbath and Wednesday, then, the important week of purchase before the Wednesday, the flowers will lead only between the 10th and the 20th hours, on the main area (La Defence and the Nation) will lead every second floor, except for this amount only one of four.
The SNCF proposal will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and the traveling will be cut off to another street.
Galeries Lafayette's business houses, who expect each day more than 200,000 customers, have announced the fact that "RATP has been trying to ensure awareness with large business houses."
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of Paris.
Managed RATP reaches from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre do Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On the fifth day, there was one floor of two and practically no equipment in the shipment of the ship, as it was in the plan.
Like in the fourth century, Ile de France's citizens have made others, and he doesn't control the smoke on the Natives.
So early morning it was in the St. Germain-en-Laye Station (Yvelines) much less than usually, and otherwise because they missed requests and students.
Jack Nbakin, ingenerator, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got a "hour and half before, to have a sure he's going to be in time."
The Sant-Lazare Nazi was not fulfilled, the SNCF State ferry announced the greater number of officers and guards.
REER A SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut, or from St. Lazare's driving with a meter.
Another valid meetings of the stating meetings will be held on the Sabbath and weeks, on which will be evaluated the results of the fifth-seventh meeting with the guidelines which the departments were determined as "face".
The RER Office proposes an action on the Special Protocol for Employment Flights REER A on all pages, workstime editing, carriers and etc.
However, it is not for the leaders who require the price of service, according to Thyerry Garon (OdboryJih).
The RATP has also submitted the proposals on the pressure that CGT has dismissed with that the leadership "the problem was not able to resolve while the travel transporters and the SNCF had done it."
On a new meeting based on the Sunday, "respects the conditions of calling," exclaimed the RATP transport undertaking.
What was the reason why the experts think that they're doing the business of weekly walking lucks.
At the last hours, the company committee had a company in his Paris seat.
The leaderships that have been rejected for any discussion during the stages were therefore decided to be in the interest of "called" for meeting.
The dangers of conflicting in the railway will also extend the RER B line after Unsa and Independent reports of the stage preparation.
The departments require premies from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros from 30 euros of variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Yih), Independents (Independents), and deal with the worst work conditions on this line which day transforms millions of traveling.
The RER officers provide in more than 2200 to 2700 euros of grapes and 600 to 650 euros for unjust work time and for work in week and party.
Turkish justice has resolved for a court party, and this Decision will make difficult consequences.
The Turkish Court of Justice on Friday decided to interrupt the main Pro-Curde Party in the country, and this decision was immediately invited to demonstrate it in the South-East Community and in Istanbul.
This Decision may be significantly complicated by the tasks of government that are trying to deliver the cord community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The site for Democratic Company (DTP) was issued because it had been “the defense of the independence of the State and its independence,” said to the newspapers, the President of the Supreme Court of Hassim Kilic after four days of operation.
The decision was adopted a singlely 11 judges when most of the parties were needed by seven voices, introduced Kiliç and added that 37 strange chambers included her President Ahmeta Turk and the presidency of Asely Tugluk had the mandate to participate in political life for five years.
The Court also announced the disruption of the parliamentary immunity which Mr. Turk and Mrs. Tugluk and the assurance of the party of the Ministry's Financial Department.
The DTP page has 21 cross in Parliament (except 500).
The leadership has already warned that the messengers would like to leave the Parliament as a messenger without political competence.
The decision is to continue the process launched in 2007 by an advocator of the Casate Court of Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, which commits DTP to obedience with the "commands" of the Curdistán (PKKK), which Ankara and many countries consider terrorism organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political victory of the PKK.
The page ensures that she does not have any "based connection" with the PKK but refuses it to mark it as a terrorist organization and calls the Government to deal with it.
The Verdikt Court comes at the moment when the Government gives the cord community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to ensure their rights and trys to limit the support of Kurds against the PKC and to end so conflict.
The DTP leaders confirmed that the desolation of the parties could be reached to the south of Anatolia, where many demonstrations were made against the conditions for which the PKK Abdullah Ecalan was held to the police officers.
From the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators were gathered together before the DTP seat in Dijarbakir, a large city in the South Sea, which is overwhelmed by the Kurds.
The police used smooth granates and water works, demonists again married Moloto's cocktails or shoot stones from the bowls.
It also showed 100 people in Istanbul.
After the exposure of the currency, Mr. Turk said that the decision of righteousness is only "a deficit."
Turkey can't solve this question (Curds, note. red.) by the law of the parties, published in the pressure.
The Government, established by the part of the islamistic decline, also denied this Decision.
We're from the principles against the destruction of the side.
It doesn't matter. He told the Ministry for Taner Yilz energy.
This Decision is a simple department of democratic proposals that have started the government, commented the Politologist Ahmet Insel.
We can expect the reaction from the PKK side, added.
On Friday, PKK reported one of the most murder attacks at the north Turkey who killed three days before seven soldiers.
Snow can come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger is.
Not because he wants to scan the citizens, he says the leader of the Science of the Technical Services of the FES.
But because his employees could try and learn to control all car techniques.
Wednesday, it could first be achieved by meteorologists.
It is prepared for more than 300 employees and 120 vehicles to look for snow and ice.
The EESC shall therefore follow in accordance with the appropriate plan.
While Frankfurt is totally smoking and temperatures under zero, they will go out to 20 such grounds and big packs, explains Brauburger.
In the middle of these measures, there are main and transitional trains such as Neue Road and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the arrivals for the hazards, the lines of the public transport, the larger areas and the shoes with the claims such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts in three hours morning.
In the case of the need, three hours are needed for the maximum of three hours to spend a soil floor better, something around 1040 miles.
That's why the FES starts in three hours in the night, "the streets are free until it starts to work."
It's easy when it's starting to get up at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, and he says the leader of the technical services, "It's why nobody's going to make a place for the field."
First, when so many disagreements, they are on a series of combined communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has side and near the streets.
Brauburger knows that they're going to fight there.
Five hours in the morning, the FES's traveling, especially the dangerous locations and transition.
The majority of the FES can't take care of all cycles.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that sees from 22 to 4.30 first monsters, says Brauburger.
While they are creating a quick leather, the ships will come out immediately when the temperature falls under two degrees.
In the case of need, the police also calls.
Dinosur collection
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other massive dinosaurs: the animal was two meters long and 1,50 meters of high flood after two strong grounds, had a low lens with smokes, smooth dreams, short primary ends with smooth trees and long oceans.
If this kind lived for a few million years later, it wouldn't have been strange.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austria and colleagues in the fourth magazine of Science writes that Tawa hallae was but one of the first dinosures with these body characters.
The animal lived almost 215 million years ago in the New Mexico today, which was found at the same time in the equivalent soil area of Pangea supercontinent.
Tava opens a new window to the first evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot of about relative relations, extension and knowledge of rare dynamisms.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other Palontologs started in Ghost Ranch at the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes, in one day, we found thousands of bones dinosauries, that is not available for triasus, reports the member of Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utahu.
Some of the bones identified the scientists quickly as a new type.
They collected the rests with five units during the shipping.
Naalez confirms the theory about the painful history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an ordinary analyz: "The dinossors of trias are very amazing, most of them will only find single surprises."
Other experts on the dinosauries are not shared with this survey without expenditure.
Especially, this amazing is not, but confirms some theory about the crazy history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonna.
According to the present scientific opinion, the dinossors first discovered 230 million years.
Many of the oldest fossiles are not, but completely, so the adherence of pradinosur is most sports.
Experts, for example, discuss when the entire people have divided into three most important developing lines: massyrebrace therapy, where Tyranosaurus king, Velociraptor, and the birds, the four-length sauropodes and their residences, and the beasts of Ornithia (potatoopants), which included the types Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is after Nesbitt analysis and his colleagues' original terapad.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At Tawa hallae, the researchers found the evidence of an aircraft age that also have the descendants of birds.
Thanks to air vaccines is to respirate birds more effective than the saviors.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the sister were clearly fulfilled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and optimal terapist with air vaccines, named Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of large sauropodes had later air vaccines and easy bones, this useful innovation has probably been common for both groups.
At least three migrants in North America
Since the most primary dinossors still lived in South America, the scientists brought out that the officers first appeared there.
Three developing lines have been divided soon and expanded from South America on all continents that then, as a supercontinent Pangea, created a single earthly mass.
She would also talk to the fact that the team was found together with Tawa hallae the rest of two others, not especially the threat of the relative terapists.
These three can't go out from one common, migrated presence, arguments scientists.
We think it has arrived at least three migrants in North America, named Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a society of scientific study.
Of course, there are also divorces.
One of the oldest species, Silesaurus, who is in the group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lives in Poland today, says the Bonne Palontolog Martin Sander.
His domain could be given a graphic image together, because in South America there were very primitive phosials of dinosaur, including on other continents, the equipment is found when.
As the dynamishers have proved that from the relatively close side of the plasma range, they have developed to Governing Refugees on the earth during the average of the earth, it remains a warm.
During the trias, the dinossors shared their live space with many other plastics, for example with the prevention of today’s crocodiles and airports and without the number of other surgerys.
At the end of the triase, the dinossors expanded into the whole world and developed many new species, while the relatives died and spread trias and jury.
Success story was not permanently loaded
There are two hypotheses, how to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It was possible to achieve massive exchanges that the dinosulars have survived the agreement, but the plastic is not.
Or the dinossors had better applied, so they could exhaust competition.
The story of success did not endure forever.
Over 150 million years later, he helped the meteorologist to help another group of animals, which was also developed in trias and lived from that time in the dark: savs.
Solidarity from Vienna after Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signals are international.
On the list are Professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
Students from Neapoli, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paul, Berlin or Brem.
The police exclamation of the French Goethe University contained Casine has been raised to the global disruption.
278 Professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also high schools throughout the Germany, Europe and North America and South America solidarized with protesting students in Westend campus.
In the declaration of the German and English, the preside of the police procedure is "not shocked."
Since the walls and the artwork were multiplied, the Universal President Werner Müller-Estler left the building that they contained last week staying students and predicting.
Then five students were lost.
The defense of things, the judges of the signators, do not justify "the disarmament of self-organized education of students and training the police command."
The excursion represents "inacceptable approach" to the freedom of research and science.
The expenditure of the vandalism serves "injustice and criminalization of the protest" and takes attention from the contents.
The presidency has gone out of the necessary discussions.
The preventive calls to stop penalty.
It says that most of the stakeholders have not supported a matter of cure.
Corrected Protest
The young organisations of Verdi and German Department are also solidarized by students.
Protest is a legitimate expression that grows care of its future, says the secret earthly younger Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessenski Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) continues to progress the university President and police.
We thank the Universal President.
Disagreements and areas are very inacceptable, she said in the quarter of the current hour (accounting hour) in the Wesbaden landing dream.
We have understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, he said to the Apostle of the Earth dream for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the positive fraction of SPD, Green and Links.
The CDU takes the walls for the close to criminalize the protest, says Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of maintaining the arguments and requirements of students, it came to the exclamation.
Linke has made a proposal that calls the Minister inside to give a report on the police office.
New Silicon-Valley
A long year he paid for a secret city, not available for visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the tenth periods of the main city of Moscow, in Swedish Swedish, was a proper location where a secret weapons investigation was carried out.
Today, this period is considered with 216,000 citizens from the Moscow Centre, for the "Russ Silicon Valley".
They are located here a significant micro- and nanoelectronic research centre and production center.
Since September 2008, Green-Gradient Researchers have contacted the French Scientific Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and companys of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were multiple visits and in the middle of Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Great Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow's Moscow's most-starist Juri Rosljak and prefected from Zelenograde Anatolij Smirnov, for Frankfurt, the guideline for Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, FIZ and small and central companies will come to the natural research on Seminar in Zelenograde.
Scientific exchange
It's one of the transitional scientist scenarios.
It is also about economic relations.
The FIZ company will be allowed to take place on the development of the Russian market.
In addition, Russian scientist companys want to cut off in Germany.
Zelenograd is a seat of significant Russian research institutions and companys.
In the middle of them, Moscow's design of electronic technology, the great concert of Sitronics and Russia Electronic.
The period was based in 1958 as "social planned city" for weapons investigation.
Zelenograd (regular translation "Green City") has received his name in accordance with the cut-cocked countrys in which research devices are placed.
Stuttgart
Stuttgart 21 is not enough to prepare.
The project's advantage is very easier for the "new Europe's heart."
All right, S21 is more than the launch of driving, more than the monster plane that will make the main city of Badenska-Württembers for a decade in a decade of stabil chaos.
Stuttgart 21 went out of the spirit of 80.
The main stations with the colleagues concluded in the center of the city were then considered as a direct-technical phossile of the 19th century, which served as a front of modern travel transport, because it was essentially needed a lot of time to override the location behind the front.
Let's stop a minute, let's go, so it should work.
And that's why the heads are in Frankfurt and Mnicho.
And in Stuttgart: travel equipment, which sits in the half of the trans-European fertilization managers between Paris and Budapse/Bratisla - therefore the slogan of the "Europe's heart."
Really starts with S21, although seeing from 80 years is not compatible with reality.
The very ambitional projectors knew that in the Hessen and Babory majority, the launch of the situation would be nearly unfinancial.
Since there are modern carriers with motor and driver vehicles on both ends, the heads have no problems with interest and exit.
However: Stuttgart 21 is started, including new ICE trading to Ulmu.
They asked it to land and community policy.
The training works, as well as because the risks of the largest individual individual infrastructure project in the Republic are a payer and not a State concert.
Urbanistically, the project can be forgiven any more way.
A new town space, which -- if we trust computer images, will contain a lot of green.
For the ferry transport system, S21 is shooting.
Traditional equipment and trading equipment are defined for personal transports - typically in the 80s - described a great growth.
Then she did not exist the competition of the levian years.
Modern transport policy must go, but in the first order of sending cost transport, because it is far more ecological than cost cars on the car.
But the new rate is not due to the low steel for the cost flows.
It is more important that S21 does not affect many other fertilizing projects.
In Sweden, there were six billion euros.
That's a official number.
Experts think of the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decades, the finances will be missed on the other urgent points and the low location in the network.
In the list of transport ministers, there are 60 larger projects.
One of the most important is the structure of 180 miles of long travel traveling by the Rhine.
Since 1987, it's a long time in this track.
Here's gonna have to be strictly smoking.
But S21's gonna be like a smoke.
The rate of Rhina will be the threat of the international cost transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the rules on aeroplane
The earthquake Government has been opened in Wisbaden’s landing dream, if it will go against the Court of Hessen of Court of Justice (VGH) in respect of the order of night and to revise it.
Coalice CDU/FDP confirmed experts to justify more than 400 pages of VGH, said the Minister of Economic Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kasselu wrote this day that it would be necessary in the case of the planned north-west ranch of the French airport to reform the new airline.
The authorisation of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as the country government predicts, does not correspond to the law established by the protection of the citizens before the night aeroplane.
Coalice must be decided to 4 January if the court review is required.
The opposition criticized this subparagraph and carried to the Government's Government manager to reveal the Revision of the Court of Community Administration in Lips.
Boss SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel called the CDU and FDP to return to the promises on the order of night years that she had given before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to be a "forwarding the word."
It's very hard if you can keep your word, he said the Green Tarek Al-Wazir boss in the front of the FDP choice column "We keep our words."
Minister Posch rejected the office of Shefer-Gumbela, the country government is trying through the "procuration of law and triky" to get to his night years.
The right control needs its time.
Coalyce doesn't want to work on the base of the "Speed First Home".
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His fractions for the order of night years were never such as it gives them the obsession.
US banks for the delivery of aid
America, the crisis of the large banks are delivered by the state struggles.
Bank of America raised an aid from Tarp's bank safe fund in a total of $45 billion (how $30 billion).
According to the reports of the United States CNBC, Citigroup also plans the national assistance.
The provisions are so wanted to save the limits to which the money has been accepted - the restrictions of the payment of bonus to managers and the border of high pounds.
Bank of America has obtained investors with a changed obligation for $19 billion pure money.
The rest of the parts took out of its stock, which was fulfilled by others by the distributors.
Kenneth Lewis' bank leader in the middle of the evening thanked the American payer: The money injection helped us to overcome a hard time.
Financial crisis was cut down on the top of Merrill Lynch's investment banks.
Citigroup wants to be released from its obligations against the State, also by providing money on the capital market.
The CNBC had notified that this American bank had already been able to report in the fourth of the capital increase in about 20 billion dollars.
The Citigroup didn't want to say that.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley.
Quick option
It was just faster than it was waiting.
The Stanice has submitted the advice only two weeks after the Administrative Board of ZDF issued the Office of Nikolause Brender.
Yesterday, I wanted to agree to the same person.
Peter Frey, leader of ZDF in the main city in Berlin, was marked for favorite.
But the stanice didn't confirm - officially to not prevent the process.
The role could also play that they did not want to disturbe ZDF Markuse Schacher if this proposal would not have passed on the Administrative Council.
Frey, the Conservator's candidate needs a support of nine of 14 members of grams.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he was traveling in the Governing Council of the Conservatory with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for more than five years.
For Brender only seven members, seven were against him. Brender's loss was for a lot of challenge, although she was waiting for.
The majority of the Office in the Administrative Council has also signed a few weeks before choices that they don't want to confirm Brender in the Office.
Rebellion against the shepherd, the Hessen Premier Roland Koch.
He refused further meetings in the office of the high-governmental shepherd by the argument that Brender's costs of monitoring ZDF.
At the time before the election, there were protests in which the centre was criticized by the political impact on the ZDF.
Finally, 35 state law law lawers have been raised in the debate as anti-existent.
It wasn't about anything.
About Personal
Peter Frey was born August 4, 1957 in Bingu.
Study policy, pedagogic and romantic.
Then he worked for the Southwest function and Frankfurter Rundschau.
Frey went to ZDF in 1983, first to the Heute Journal.
Next stage: 1988-1990 the personal reference of the shepherd; 1991/92 writer in Washington; leader and moderator "Morgenmagazins" to 2001; from that time the principal study of ZDF.
After being Brender, who was chosen in the middle of the extraordinary Medium Magazin newspaper, he was seen, reported the Green that they gave a basic request.
The Coach's anticandid in the Administrative Council, the Rinsko-Falk Premier Kurt Beck, explained the past week that the community countries should change the State Agreement with ZDF so that personal proposals of the candidate could not be blocked in politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused the exclusion of strange policies from ZDF observers.
Brender's proposed advice Peter Frey made the administrative advice to the intellectual shadow - directly after Brender's meeting was criticised for this strong grim.
Thanks to this proof of newspaper independence, he could name him in place of the shepherd without the loss of face as Shaker, so he could be chosen by the Administrative Council, and would not be surprised that the shepherd would be moved to the office.
In the strange aritmetic, Frey is not attracted to the left liberals.
The study is rescued by harmpades
Particular success for students: After a year of loading, the Ministry of Culture was finally achieved in the quarter of the communities: at the Conference of Ministers of Cultural and High Schools, both parties agreed that it is wanted to improve the study conditions for fertilizers and masters.
Students should be able to control their study in the future.
It was particularly agreed that it was reduced by tests: Of course, every study module should be completed by a single test.
Furthermore, it should be checked on the work of students, and it should be a "real and restrictive peace."
Politics and high schools want to reduce the recognition of the high schools in Germany and foreign schools.
Communist countries are convinced that they create more flexible common structural tasks for the Executive and Master Study Boards.
The earthquakes should stop existing.
Less tests
From the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministry of Culture and Universal Rectors were classified in the mouths of a better study.
Now, the first is filled with specific contents.
The likely accredited Council concluded that the number of trials to share drastically reduces: "Every module will be completed only one test," wrote in the 30-side report, which will be reached to regulate the approval of studies.
"Excellently low trial steps," reported the Chairman of Reinhold Grimm's Accreditative Council, "determined a false development that explicitly limited the training of the study."
This must be the "a number of studies" in the future "decisive criteria" when implementing.
Modules and contents are "they must be severely checked" to "not be limited to students in choice
Seminars."
Students should be "the range of space that allows and supports its own initiative."
The rules shall be paid by approval of new studies, after researching, but also for the remaining studies.
You're needed to "preacredit" every five years, but it means that it will continue to 2015 before all studies will be checked.
The responsibilities for this are throughout the German ten accreditation agents, which comply with the adcridency Councils established by society countries.
In October, the Ministry of Cultural officers called "excellently" society countries to employ agents so that the entire education would not be too big and testing mode.
Universities and high schools have already agreed with the field ministry on relevant measures.
As a longer, the only country promised additional means for the further Bolonian process.
From money, high schools should first play consultation programmes and study advice, and to send test and foreign authorities.
They want to build 10 million euros on this country and high schools.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to be governed to give to Parliament the Novembre of High School Act.
According to her, only one test should be needed for the end of the study module.
The formation of the study should be more flexible, which should be interrupted by the recognition of tests from other high schools and the accessibility of the master.
At the end of the next year, it should be checked on the review of all studies in the country.
Government and obsessions have reached studies in the country in the fourth century.
Through the praises, the crisis of deceit was also fallen.
The Community representative of high school groups of Yuso was invited to create education policy in the future "closed doors" ministers and high school directors.
At least after the stage, "the students should speak to it at least a word."
Academic also received support from the President of the High School Research Conference (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said in the fourth meeting with the Ministry of Cultural Ministry with the HRK on the common reform report.
According to the Economic and Scientific Affairs (EEA), the Bonn Resolution was not sufficiently far: they require legal proceedings, which would allow each applicant to the arbitrary title to access the established master studies.
Secondly, society countries must ensure that tomorrow, for the generation of the elephant students of the elephant Affairs, they have been available to have locations in teacher studies with the best conditions of study, the member of the representative of the GEW Andreas Keller.
Communist countries must be employed far more than forwards.
However, the Ministry of Cultural officers did not depart to free access to teachers programmes.
More than note underneath to Herta Müller
To get to German and out there is good if there's no control...", it seems that one of the basic boxes of Werner Söllner, who is in this excited language coach, discusses experiences with accessing a disciple who received freedom, and also came about his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Roman Banat, first worked as a German teacher and English teacher in Bukurest and later as a reader of one child's library, and then 1982 went to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Sullner was described by various literary prices, 1993 has submitted Poseia to the French Goethe University, and since 2002 Hessen's literature forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant militeral disruption was the past in a seminar in Mnich, on which "the German literature in Romania in the cyrcadle and the smoke of its security acts."
Obviously, Söllner left the statement in which before the colleagues of Germany, Richard Wagner, William Totokem, France Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, agrees to cooperate as a secret reporter of the Romanian Security.
With some of the presents, Söllner received the German language price in 1989.
In 1971, the trials of reversation started unexpectedly, first in 1971.
I'm, continuing to Sullner, "When someone who didn't have enough trials to fear the Security side."
Director Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
While currently with the Nobel Prices of Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary arrangement with the detatory government mechanisms is a literal scene, and especially the German authors of Romania community, is deprived by the case that marks the depths and the ability of the political system based on control and shopping.
Werner Söllner isn't, at least if it can be said according to the exact state of knowledge, only a believer, but it's also a victim.
In Security, the secret agent Walter played some role, said after Sullner's appreciation, Michael Markel and showed a positive impact on his secret agent Walter.
"He's looking for me" then in all the basic points for him, says Markel.
He has moral responsibility to make this note.
The Sullner's statement was in this form and before this public was unexpected, however, very surprising the appreciation of the ancient disident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she reads his own act, 914 pages that Germany was a favorite reserve for the Security spirales.
The treatment, they can imagine, will spread, and in some cases, and probably know what name is hidden by Shorin, Voice and Walter.
Except in Turkish, between a very sure looking at Stazi's folder, the manipulation of the Securite control is still very different.
In recent years, the systematic light of marriage was limited and limited.
One of the Birthler Offices responsible for the National Council to the Treaty of Security (CNSAS) was based first in 1999, the exhibition of a act was excessively longer.
First, since 2005, there is a law that leads to the Directory Management.
As the older members of Security have still a great influence in Romania, he added the Nobel price for Hert Mullero one conversation in which one of the old boss of Security from Temishvar had expressed the notifier of the approval.
He's a mental psychosis, the ends were only heard once.
The power's condemnation has been expressed increasingly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, to the case of Söllner, as well as in relation to the famous offence, they take unresolved questions.
Why now? Who has been disappointed? Special audience reactions on Sullner's approval allows expecting that the continuation of this chapter will be determined at least the same time after science than after the accusation of sin and study.
For the genetic work of Herty Müller, which took Nobel's price yesterday, is more than a note under the corner.
Scientific input Champions League
It seemed that a pure industry manager of the disease of a disease officer, on which the manufacturer of the sports of sport bodies had been driving four hours after the north to the new VfBr Christian Gross trainer in the implementation of an ornamental colored sponsor.’
A man with the marketing balls left him to carry after him a strange city.
Otherwise, he could lead himself - alcohol was not in the game, and a 55 - year - old man was too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it's gonna continue to work.
Or it's gonna start.
The words first three days of the anguished Switzerland: "We have got eight mifinals," which is in Champions League thanks to the exchange3:1 on the Union Urziceni from Romania, "but we can't let us succeed with success: it's a brutal fight against meeting."
"The most important task" stands before us in the week.
It is important to repeat in Mohuchi's execution from the King class and in the regular line days.
And to meet the clear slambines after three quick grids of Maricy (5.), Tresche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Department
Eight-final Champions League (Execution 16./17. + 23./24 February/received emission 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be released on 18 December in Nion.
Therefore, the advice of Babbel's excessive advice will be maintained.
Not only in a medicine that added to the neighborhood stetugart professionals during a short time of self-consciousness, the achievement of the setup and the joy of the game.
I went to the players, and I told them that they had to meet their strong sites, and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the doctor of the life of Gross so easier to know the successful recipe, but because of Babbel's treatment, but no effect.
He deemed a certain magic, and recognized the President of Babbel Jens Lehmann, "When a new impulse comes in the photobale, it becomes sometimes things that you shouldn't consider as possible."
And Sami Khedir, who, after many weeks of exposure, became his dinamic immediately the best player on the ground, tried to describe the "fenomen" named "the black wind" and the workers of a new overseer, "It's a man who is radically and requires disciple.
That's what we need in the present situation."
It's obviously wrong for Babella.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns the Sport President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more staff.
Like Gross, the players and managers don't want to exceed the victory against the replaced and fully overwhelmed to the protection of the Roman host.
They would also win in Glasgovia before the smoking winning after the rate of 0:4 in Leverkusen, Khedir.
And the Sport President Horst Heldt reminded that even one objective has arrived in the region, the second is still far.
We're not on the water yet.
Because Heldt at his 40th birthday was not celebrated nor after the first home winning after three months, the weekly events that had lived seriously in the form of television conversation with the branch Jens Lehman at the beginning of the safe.
There's a decision that makes others and not Jens, Heldt replied to Lehman's criticism.
He proposed a low leadership representation and decided to change the trainer after the pubertal fans.
And that he was interrupted by his free day after the shoes, he marked Lehmann as a sign of a missing suverency and a suffering.
Lehmannov's phrase "forms pure egoism", he replied and announced the consequences for the branch.
Both fourty people will have no joy of life anymore.
Everyone is along with others that without the work of a seated trainer team could not be so strong and fightable.
Babbel and his assistents had a "great part of success," says Heldt and Lehmann, a single voice - and a man with a grilled coach.
Sebate the mystery of the world in a hard ship
Your duty in Berna: The caller Kevin Johnson continued to do words and managers of the world of Vitalia Click.
However, after twelve severe rounds, the Ukraine raised his title in a hard boxer office of WBC.
The statement of decisions was a single vote.
Hamburg - Vitalij Click remains the mystery of the world in the box in a hard ship.
The 38-year campaign WBC shot on the Sunday night in Berna American Kevin Johnson on a single point (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For the Key, it is the third successful term of the title after its return in October 2008.
First, Ukraine was two times mystery of the WBO and WBC organization world.
It wasn't happening to... who were all waiting for.
The key increased his balance in 39 winnings in 41 professional rooms, it was twice disappointed.
The caller Johnson was first in the 24th quarter.
Before the 17,000 divines in Bernella, the High Click ordered 2.02 meters to the top of its left.
On 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Clickcoy Eir, but stood before the master of the world, so Kličko could not make the decision of his dangerous rights.
He did the passitive Johnson to the caller a little bit and just tried to get to the other colds.
The key has made words and gestures, his bodies, but the master of the world's trephiles just sometimes.
But that's the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fighted with the Klick with 12 cols.
The caller was in Switzerland's main town for the breakfast.
He threw the Key as a "rebellious zombie" that "nick doesn't die right."
While the fifth wedding was left the champion to explore, Johnson stood Johnson from the sun's nest, "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth winning after Click return
The key remained even after the fourth seat after its return on 11 October 2008.
After the fourth past, he smoked up in Berlin Nigerice Samuel Peter and took back the WBC path, which had to be able to be struck without battle.
In this year, John Carlose Gomez from Kuba and on September, Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this world, I just got one morning and physically in a good form, I made the Click's fast return to the ring.
His dream remains, but the protection of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the mystery of the WBO and IBF organization world.
The WBA feeds Brit David Haye, after he sitted on November 2,13 meters of the high Nikolaje Vulajeva.
Haye replied in the year of the ship against the Click that was planned on September.
He plans his promotory society against Click in London Wembley Stadium.
Attachment of Kunduz
Meanwhile attack: Leader of Green Fractions Jürgen Trittin marked because of bad information about the Affairs of Kundúz Minister of Protection of Guttenberg for lie.
SPD and Linke (Levice) call the office to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the most recent recognitions to the complaint on Kunduz, the oposis is considered that the Ministry of the Defence of Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has been allowed to have a knowledgeful claim.
The Ministry for the death bombing two cisterns in September said "I know the wrong," said the boss of the Green Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday Report ARD "Tagessky".
Let's call it a regular expression: Lhal.
The mandate to kill was given in non-respecting the rules of international security support forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the basic report that the NATO had reading Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
In the fifth day, it appeared that it wasn't only about the destruction of cutting cars, but only about the target killing two Taliban leaders.
At the U.S. Airport that requested the German Leader Kunduz Klein, the NATO was investigated to murder or punish until 142 people.
Green, SPD and Linke called on the Sabbath of the Society Office of Angelu Merkelo (CDU) to express it immediately before the Common Snow, and also explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs. Mercel should explain whether the agency policy is a part of Afghanistan's Community dreams, and if the officers, the Bundeswehr and the new strategy have approved, they called Jürgen Trittin and college from the Green Renate Künst.
The speaking government Ulrich Wilhelm decisively refused the crisis.
The office office has no influence on a particular statement of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, said.
In the Sabbath, there was also an explanation of the doubts of the Ministry's treatment on the Background of the General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberg were informed correctly and completely on the Background of an attack on the cisterna.
It was officially noted that they had to postpone the existing reports of the NATO and close the officer's citizen details.
Nevertheless, by both superficial officers, they noted that the Ministry of Protection was noted even on several reports, between them on the two-side document of the Vice-Leader Klein and on a report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgeener Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had to soon request a letter to explain the situation.
It is stated that he hasn't yet received any answer.
The Ministry has not been raised on the Sabbath, and has shown that this will be resolved in the Community Research Committee, which will be established by the next Meeting.
Snow Worlds
Some see images in a low state and hear voices that others don't see and hear.
Not only psychically sick or in drug disorders, the limits between imagination and reality.
It's all right until it's going to sleep.
If we are closed with the eyes in our dark room, we are able to turn around the most wonderful imaginations and fantastic overwhelmings.
But whoever lives in the dreams of dreams, see and hears things that others see and hear not, pays most of them in the west world of this world for a fool or a drone, or at least as a wage.
However, such images and voices are not only in psychically sick or in drug resistance.
The wine has our presence: the same neuronal processes that allow us to propose houses, draw images or write rounds here and ask them to spread the borders between dream, representation and reality.
The changed dreams of knowledge can be shown in the most different ways, in the best case we call them vision, in the worst blade.
Although the initiator and the effects are able to lie, however, Hildegard von Bingen, the drug surveys of the prophet New Age Carlose Castanedy, the Shaman's state of blocking, psychose and halucination from similar processes.
Halucination or visibility are increasing if the equation of neuronal transmitters of the brain - especially dopamin, norradrenalin, seroton and acetylcolin - and interaction between various parts of the brain is moved.
Complex halucination and corrupt thoughts are very frequently shown at shizofren psychose.
Gravitation has no power over him
The relationship between the heart and the dream worked at philosophy and the doctor already since old.
Aristoteles understood a halucination as a form of dream in a low state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the modern psychology, constated in 1861, "the great likeness of blowing with dreams," for Sigmund Freuda was a dream even "psychose, with all the senses, disturbation, crying minds."
It's in 2001, Henning T. is changed in the comic situation.
His body is double-dimensional and crystally colored.
Gravitation has no power over him, it's up to the room tree.
He feels a cup.
Following him a cutted black position with blood red grimas, precious dentes.
Honor him, they're cutting to him hard, fired bottles, getting with him about the wall, feeling pain on the whole body.
The voice, the bad voice is worse from the wall and the radio.
He can't smile the voices they give him and urge him.
Henning T. gets two boxes out of the stare, cuts them into the smoke and throws it on the shock on the street.
He's gonna stand on one player, and the smoke's going around the bridge.
Shooter.
The snippet allows it.
Learn, the assembly's voice, "Go to the clinical, and let you treat!"
Today, Henning T. 40 years, he had six activists, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is a schizoaffective paranoic psychose, except it is maniodepresitive, take medicines against depression, mania, slizofrenia.
He learned to live with his disease, three years are married.
I've been the worst fear and the deepest ideas in the psychose, he says.
The aspects are a serious fact.
A percent of patients are at least one for the life of shizofrenia, in psychiatric clinicals it is after the depression of the second most commonly treated disease.
In a bunch of shizofren psychoses, the majority of the entire and external worlds cannot be distracted, they get into a surrounded state that can lead to halucination, size, relationship illusion or an illusism of persecution.
Especially extended is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or guide dialogues.
No optical halucinations are normal.
It is not able to distinguish significantly, the brain can't filter the moved signals, the knowledge is paid to the reception.
Like the dream of open psychose, the idea and fantasies of the most deeply highest knowledge have made.
The reality of the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the high doctor Clinics of the universal psychiatrie of the University Clinic clinicals in Heidelberg.
Shizofreni is located in the division center, everything has the significance on him.
In addition, it is achieved to the passive role, becomes like in the dream, which is able to form them actively.
Thus, Shizofrenici feels often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not most possible, the surprises are serious facts, the exemption is excluded.
One for life to use halucinations
In addition to the dream, Fuchss says, "But the structure of intelligence and space of reality which a person is mentally maintained."
Blue thoughts and halucinations are based on reality, to decline the use in real frames.
The scientists still stand before the training, why exactly our brain does such transmissions.
Excellent states may be able to make each person to lose a shortage of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
Not everybody's going to get into the psychose.
It seems that there exists genetic accessibility to schizofrenia, but studies on doubles showed that genes are not the only specific factors.
The scientists are exceeding that the persons who are attached have the minimum illness of the brain.
We imagine that in the early stage of development, the neurological nerve of the brain, such as the viral disease of mothers during the illness, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a weakness, as it comes to the discharge of the neuronal system that hasn't occurred for a long year.
Roles also play the impacts of the environment - stres or traumatical experiences may be a psychotic initiativer if available.
Halucinogene drugs can also start psychosis because they are in the transport system.
When our brain is closing
The green is that psychotronics suffer their halucinators, and to save them, they pull delicious medicines, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
If we think of the surface as a favorable or unbelievable, it is often only a question of positions.
Casten has already collected 10 years of reports about halucinating and overwhelming, in the long-term year he interpreted his results in the book "The Irreal World in our head" (Nereal World in our head).
Halucination is also typically conducted psychoes, but also surprised for many other diseases.
Alongside psychic pains such as frontal personality or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsie, disease sclerose or Alzheimer or brain trauma.
It is surprisingly halucinated for certain conditions and the brain of a healthy man.
Halucination, according to Kastena, is based on the contents of the thoughts that are normally attached.
They threaten when the parts of the brain in which the meaning is processed are too active or less active; if our brain is closed, or if it is missing the stimulation.
The drugs can start this status as a brain-smoking or psychose.
However, it also brings stimulations, stress, concerns with love or other exceptional states.
In new studies, he made a third question that at least one time in the life of the halucinations lived.
In 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small city in the Meklenbursca-Foreign Season and walks on the mystery.
Actually, a normal girl.
If there were no pictures and voices here.
The stops may be that she's a plot to cooling with long, dark hairs.
When he answers, they look at her with a surprise - no one sees except her and doesn't hear this boy.
These nice girls think of a sneeper, but Sarah K's not sleeping, you know.
He's up, hearing, and seeing the boy, exactly the same as he hears and sees a girl sitting near herself in the lavage.
He can even feel his presence, at least a few moments.
It's a pleasant feeling, he loves the boy.
I'm foolish?
But he knows that this boy and other transfusions are not real and he's lost again.
In the night, there's nearly smoking
Sometimes it's a training.
When he sits in the class, he can't look for a few times because the teacher in her eyes and the ear is just representing a new community, but he explains all others hearable and visible on the table of mathematical equation.
In the night, there's almost smelling.
When he waits in his dark room on a bed that comes a little while and too late, he can't be different if it's up or if he's already sleeping, if images that he see, grimas, or girl with blood shirts on his hands and feet, they'll be off before her open or closed eyes.
Let me go to the room, crying on those positions.
The parents and friends don't say anything about it, they would think she was crazy.
After 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years.
Vloni made married and lived with his friend.
A year ago, the halucination was set.
From the time she contacted Kasten psychologist, she knows exactly that she wasn't crazy.
The reputations are also the knowledge of the conscience.
If someone is socially isolated or rejected, he will have a great chance of halucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain's no longer employed, and he's able to make sure he's happy.
Sarah K., the only girl, was like a little girl's fear of other children, often played alone.
Her halucination started when she learned in 13 that the man who's called Dad from the time when he's thinking is not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic halucinations, the same brain areas that also operate real enemies and sounds are hard to have as Sarah K. hard to distinguish frauds and reality. "Every use," says Kasten, "he's gone into the brain, and reality is also shown there.
The halucinations are also images that allow the brain to get out of the brain, so it's so real."
Even the night dreams apply Casten as a form of halucination.
Halucination of health people is not primarily distinguished from halucination in acut psychosis.
In contrast to shizofrenians, people are psychically healthy to identify their faults as non-real.
Castens therefore advise to their patients to assess the halucination as an extraordinary capacity.
Born status between dream and halucination
In our world, too concentrated on knowledge is the ideal use of the majority of pathology, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg, and the psychiatric and psychoterapeutical clinical clinicals of Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychose is hard, courageous, but also brings positive, creativity - translation is also a knowledge of desolation.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied such an unioid form of research, a special form of changed knowledge to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, efficient dreams, which considers real and can't be different from the low state.
Oneiroid knowledge states in extreme circumstances caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with a polyradicular rate that use in full knowledge of motor protection.
When a person is a worried loss of the world and himself, to be permanent, completely incapable of movement, replaces the worried real situation with its own, imaginary world that is deconnected from the reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of border state between dream and halucination.
Because reality is not possible to control any situation, the change of the world, the real situation is, but it's a real situation.
The intensive shape of aid of minds and the transfusion of senses in some disasterable situation that allows us to form our own capacity during the time to lose knowledge.
Everything is real, and later in records
The story of Peter Cornelius Clausen also describes his unioid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Herrwechsel's heart) as a saved action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when he was 49 years after the heart's deal with the next transplantation of the heart had made his knowledge on a few days, and his body was inevitably lifted on a single intensive treatment.
Clausen entered into the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an older man on the bed, in the floor sanitary, the robot watchs his health.
He lives in the middle of the morning between a damn thing that produces a blood-infectious substance.
On the motorce, the Greek throws him into his power, on the hospital bed is surfaced on the office in Alpach and the pool of the Korean mafia.
It's totally involved in imaginary history, everything is real, and later in reminders.
These internal paths are essentially different from any dream.
Sen is another status, she describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental paths are clearly clearly for years and in the unexpected detailed detail.
Even more clear and intensive than real use.
The intensity of this consumption deploys the horizon of our other real experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
The ends show onioid states, psychoses, halucination and drug reactions, as the crowns are also in the lower state of our internal images of external reality.
Every change of the state of knowledge, the psychologist of Kasten, "will bring to deform the fact that we say reality."
The reality that can also be obvious.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27, children's training
The new leadership of Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to transmit his business into his both children's hands, said SPIEGEL.
Holding has also 100 percent of family in the future.
Hamburg - The manufacturer Hubert Burda sees his long-term business in his children's hands.
Both children will be inherited in 27 years, and they will have a certain will to enter the company, says the 69-year man of SPIEGEL.
We've solved the detail.
The question, whether they are also active in the company, is considered until then.
And the question, if they're able to do it.
You can't set 7500 employees of their children if they are not sufficiently able.
It would kill like children, such a business.

Various scotches
The Sunday is close, and it's time when it's appropriate to discover what the celebrity takes, and to apply it also to its celebration shadow.
The creation of the stream is very important to exalte the position, which is necessary to have knowledge.
We'll make a few proposals.
The song of Fergie chose extravagant and very complicated tree.
Index in Barcelona, with electromobile
The Energetic Company of Energy was based on "LIVE Cancer".
It is one of the projects for the development and design of the electrical car in the main city of Catalan.
The LIVE officer (Logistic for Electromobile) will establish and will lead a road plan for the carriers in the city and ensure the agreement in the mobility area, will be established, coordinated and submitted.
MoVELE will also develop, propagate electromagnets, collecting views and results of activities in the entered sectors.
In general, the purpose of supporting this transport environment to the future.
3 'Electric City'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that is in the draft of electrical cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are also attached to the project.
One of the three cities who chose the government in the framework of the MOVELE Plan to support the implementation of electromobiles.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support the activities in the area of research and technological development in the Catalan autonomic area.
This includes the activities relating to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
The only initiative with Endess participation, which is the processing of electromobiles.
The Community is attached to European normalization teams and is actively implemented by a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero prevents the silent time in the car industry.
President of the Government Joseph Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export studies of the State, waiting "called periods".
In the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero took measures carried out in the year for the support of the automobil sector.
"Besides the Concurrency Plan for Automobile Research Plan, we would wait for a state of disaster, to close some of our main manufacturing undertakings," stated the Government President.
"Therefore this plan and the achievement of the individual tags and further implementing in Spain in this high competition sector, the future provides certain periods of peace in this industry, which is our main export sector."
In this meaning, the competitive plan, which creates part of the integral car rental plan (PIA), determined 800 million for 19 producers projects and 137 support firms that promoted investments over 3 billion euros.
The President of the Government explained that this investment was defined for the development of new models, for modernization of production and remaining processes.
The Sahara also submitted government measures to support and mentioned the 2000E plan applied in cooperation with autonomous areas and vehicle tags.
According to the statement of the President, this plan allowed to reduce the average rate of emissions in new vehicles sold on Spanish market, and to ensure the "signed growth" of records, particularly in November "40 percent".

Mazda3 i-Stop: maintenance of sport style
It is appropriate to show that the sex to the environment has no negative impact on the sportstyle.
And thus Mazda3 has also built a system of stoping and starting engine - baptized asi-Stop-, which is the device that is currently available only with the benzine engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is defined by good characteristics that have been achieved as a whole.
Planning, carriers, citizenship, behaviour, mechanic, system and-Stop...
All these aspects are wonderful at Mazda3.
The previous seats yesterday's location of managers have a wonderful entity and are greatly fixed.
The calling is so amazing.
The help of tools and console we will conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's tendency in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and expressed red and blue colors.
This style reminds us partly the style that also represents Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasts of German products and, particularly, more sVolkswagen Golf, who all want to hurt.
As usually, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who are very comfortable.
Furthermore, it is necessary to mention a large range and a regulatory face.
Automatic stoping and launching the engine system is still available only with a benzine engine on two letters and 150 horses with the manufacturer.
This engine is a real layer. It's very dark, it's decreased with a deep depth, its exercise and lower consumption.
Although the most required Mazda3 is in the version of diel, all those who don't find so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with benzine engine, because it is higher comfort in the ship and reduced consumption.
As regards the exhibition, the version selected for testing is named Sportive and includes the larger number of series elements.
In the series of safeguards, it is necessary to mention the primary monitoring system of driving lens (RVM), which guards the relationship of the dead range, tattoo control and stability, control of speed, internal cycle control on light, digital computer with large screen, parking cycles, self-continent climate, raining sensor, light and bluetooth audio and role of 17 cool slide.
And if the storage is not sufficient, this version was issued by Pacck Premium, for annex 1.500 €: adaptable doublexenon and audio system BOSE with CD maintainer, except other parts.
Closure
Mazda3 2.0 and-Stop is one of the most compact cars of their category.
It is designed in particular the quality of materials used, its manufacturer and high-term exhaustion.
In addition, people who don't find greater number of kilometers per year can choose this i-Stop version that is only with benzine engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only incident of this model is his higher price that makes 21.770 € in Luxury and 23.270 € in the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for each day.
Luxembourg 'Premiera'

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usually, chose dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to view mails, without the possibility of viewing a type of attachment or surfing on the network.
He used his five minutes of glory in the United States when his Time was appreciated as one of the annual products.
To see her outside is hard, but this idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
At the difference of smartphones, Peek defines a very low price and month payments, less than half amount paid for the iPhone date plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new devices: one is designed exclusively for Twitter, the second, based on the basis of a non-tailed data services, but it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-tail.
FunPeek, which was present yesterday on the Le Web action, is a European version of the outcome and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as his American traveller, but it brings surprise.
The month price for maintenance takes £ 12 € per month and covers roaming throughout Europe.
People who walk with smartphone already know what it means to come on data services after overriding or indulgently looking for the WiFi chair (or connecting the background) to see the e-mail.
Attachment with rooming for a certain price is incrediblely attractive and should be carried for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but because of my experiences, a man would need a physical doctor to understand them, and also a very good brain to read the miniature.
The European Commission is not still required to reduce the tarify of the roaming to be accessible for all Europeans, which still does not have any effects.
This is the original fear of the use of data services outside the home country.
It means that such tools like FonPeek (it is interesting that there is also the name of the Fon if there is no WiFi) to get this type of tarif, the operators will start thinking differently and consider various offers that would compense their data network.
Kindle is another beautiful example, provides downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is joined and shall be paid in purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting that one time in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent access such as Peek has already been carried out in the United States.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'm looking for a phone mail, thank you.
I'm waiting for it, because I think it's the best type of consumer.
It would be interesting if this system could also be used in the computer.
Colour of Michelle
Yellow is an uncertainly favorable color of the first United States ladies.
For Baracka Obama to the function of the President of the United States, she chose a clothes and a cup in this color, he also chose the same colour when she brought it at the second most important time of his life: the transfer of Nobel's prices of peace in Osla.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow with thick effects -, in both cases it was a classic complete - clothes, hair and caught of the same substance - a large height or line.
On the first view, the first lady of the United States decided to go into the steps of the Asturian prince and to wear similar clothing.
The baby from which clothing is prepared, makes both models significantly different.
In the opportunity of evacuation to Michelle, a large country used in Oslu samet with potter.
Changes also complements: green bottles with middle high pad, currently possible model, but in gold color.
It's also a variety of accounts: this timesdrdol, before disappointed hairs.
75% of the working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Discrimination in the employment has increased in the last years, especially in women of younger adults who are determined to make a child.
This is the result of the study "Protection and work career of Spanish women" which carried CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study participated in 9.737 women in age from 15 to 75 years, and the results are unique: 75% of the working mothers have limited possibilities on the work market for maternity.
The study indicates that at the beginning of partner use, many differences are in view of the number of children according to whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who don't work outside houses are working on party responsibilities or don't have stabil work, start live with partners before, first birthing the first child and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stabil employment, especially in the public sector, partner use and maternity, and have less descendants.
"Women from 35 to 49 years have the first child at the average of 3,7 years from the beginning of use with partners. These numbers are 4.1 in the case of a woman whose achievement of their stabil employment has increased most of their life, and they should therefore deposit partnership and children's future.
The type of vocation has such a strong influence on maternity, even if smaller influence on the time of use with partners," explains Margarita Delgado, which is carried out to the CSIC research.
Another factor that affects women during the closed marriage of the seeds is the grade of education.
From the investigation, it explains that what is higher education grade is higher, so it's the age that women lead and have their first child.
The differences are also between women the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education born their first child in age 25,1, p. 32,1.
"There is another difference between women in respect of their education.
Women with basic education are delivered and born the first child before they find a stabil employment, while women with central or high education proceeds avoid the presence of a stabil employment, before closed marriage and birthing of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also for that.
L'Oreal Paris just added a new name to his prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German heritage will become the face of the various products of this tag under the Universal Password 'Why I'm looking for it'.
The 'Joyeux Noël' representative, one of the most unlegal international erectors, is added to another honourable personL'Oreal Paris such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
It was still before it to the selected Evangeline Lilly heritage club ('Destruction') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from chatche').
The Lord's part of this cosmetic tag is also attached to significant personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey' anatomie') and Matthew Fox (Evangelinen partner in 'Detracted').
British mode prices
The British have a lot of things to talk about the way.
Their most important representatives - the representatives and models, the previous and more present-- have met on the annual price transfer in London, on Royal Court os Justice.
Nobody missed the meeting.
She was a model of Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen by the best year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicent provides in 'Esy Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration of Fernando Vicente) thirty rentgen pictures of writers who met in his literary life (and in some cases and in normal life).
It does not do so in the feared and prevented rooms (biographical similitude, life and work), but looks for something like creativity.
The path brings a disruption and Vicent disturbs and inspiration.
This book is a wonderful use of reader, and it is also when reading again.
I'm going to get some spectacles here.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I found that the Mediterranean is not the Mediterranean Sea, but the spiritual impulse, almost physical, as I feel, but it can't be named: use of contrast, moral without sin and innocentness without any god."
about Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, alegorical Christian, wrote for his own nature and no intelligence, something between unbelievable and unknown, with a better poetical humor, without meaning, as it would be the foot that killed him a little."
To Graham Green: "Our man was given your own to this woman for all thirty years, illness, joy, and exemption, which is the spiritual principle for the sky's way of losing."
James Joyce: "This Odyssea delivered in Paris in 1922, Sylvia Beach. One of the eighth tops in the universal literature, which is needed to convince from the north side of which often makes you the best horloge."
William Faulkner said, "I was a strange man.
He said about himself that he was a heritage of the ships of the ships, once he's a black son with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream."
On Louis-Ferdinando Celine: "This writer took a anointed exclamation of this man from Mnichva to bring his appointment to the night of the XXth century in his literary form, fleeing before himself and calling to the future and speaking to the Red."
"O Dorothy Parker," she said, "It's my beloved God, let me stop write as a woman."
Joseph Conrado: "In his tombs, the Spensero's versions were raised: "The dream will come,/ after the struggle of silence, / after the war of a rest, / after the full life of life."
Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression in his worms.
The husband agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was looking for her between the balls or that birds were singing grecally.
No man has never been so patient and loved in the neurotics whose literary talent is in hand with foolishness."
O Pio Baroja, "What other way did Martha Santos beyond Joyce to Bario?
What else happened to Benet than to leave Bario to fix Faulkner's weapons?
What else did he go to Celo than to make honor for the praise of that man's glory?"
Agressive agressive
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother passed on our fourth, in Fuenlabrad, and a group of young people in the age of 15 to 18 years passed in a cold and our dog, a cross saved from the smoke of the driving of maximum of six kilograms, without the only word, they burned her twice and hungry.
Our discourage is greater than we can't see anything amazing in such agression against a small and unbrand animal, which was more on the water.
And to this chair of the old lady after this incident, when he went on the front with those individuals, he began to fear the safeguard, for such a devil, who is able to do the same and female, children, old man, or any one who is lower than himself.
It happened in five hours afternoon, in the worst, normally quiet fourth.
The fish weared all the day.
Of course, we have given the courage to the nearest Commissioner, but we are surprised that it was something, and that we don't choose cool issues, we constat that these murderers were a Spanish nationality.
The disputation has committed us to announce this reality.
We don't understand what happens to the young ones today when it's thinking that they're training the unseen animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right exploitation has been seen, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together to use helm
The manufacturer Michelin in collaboration with the Spanish location for transport security (Fesvial) started campaign for the use of helm, especially in younger motorists, as these two companies have been informed today.
The purpose of this initiative is to indicate the significance of the use of the helm, because it is the only means that can be limited by the destruction of heads forward and death in the case of non-conditions in the motocycle.
The Michelin Community declares that this campaign creates part of their obligations for transport security, which means more than proposing and produce more safe products, and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this objective and other form of instructive and information campaign.
This new campaign for the use of helm on the motocycle, under the password 'This be or not it be be be be be be', is the first phase when more than 500 corrected motorcycles will be placed to be achieved into the most largest publicity.
And at the end of the company, Michelin warned that the transport security is "the constant problem" of this company, which is the producer of pneumatic for two-cool vehicles, and its main objective is no longer higher the safety of the products.
Increasing the sale of easy useful vehicles
At least two years, the markets of easy use vehicles are starting to remember.
All 9.425 vehicles in November in Spain signed a increase in 12.6% in comparison with 2008 and more, on the first increase after 22 months of sustainable impact, for the number of the parental organisations of Anfac and Ganva's products.
However, the rating data is better to give to the karantine, because November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison, and 60% reduction in comparison with the previous year.
It is therefore that not regarding the loop of the last month, the entire number of vehicles entered in the last 11 months creates 40% less than in the previous account year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles were sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of easy useful vehicles: derivals of personal cars, pick ups, additives, small cost cars and easy stones/waters.
And no clouds have gone out, which most of the demand, even though private persons were buyed, most of the purchases have made small and average companies, and at least 100% of cases have been financed by third persons.
In order to be restricted by the closement of bank credit resources, other factors must also be added as a setting of activity or to continue a bad economic situation.
In this situation, in different ways of personal vehicles, the 2000E purchase support was not too helped.
Furthermore, private persons are necessary to indicate the izoby undertaken on a small and middle companies, which are determined to buy easy use carrier to 3.5 tonnes with fair CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations was confirmed.
Once yesterday from Ghana, they remembered that the special attention is needed to be carried out by these vehicles and also industry vehicles (camony and buses).
The Conference of Productors suggests that in 2010, the development will be similar to the line and for the calculations of selling in personal cars and 4x4 will be 19%.
The manufacture system is already obligated to build.
In the case of an ABS anti-blocking system, it will also be raised by the ESP stability of the manufacturer systems, that will be the obligation of European vehicles.
In fact, a part of all new personal cars and easy use vehicles have already been established, while the others are set out for the debt disposal, which is in February 2011.
The measures carried out in the EU have to increase the protection of travellers, as well as functioning to help restrict a lot of challenges.
The manufacturer system increases the pressure on the front in the noise, which will find the system after the driver is slowed.
But it's not always able to keep this press until the end.
According to the study made by the manufacturer of Bosch carriers, the third leaders who have a accident, did not exceed the smoking and half of them had not exceeded full power.
At 1.100 cases
In addition, this aid requires the maximum rate of the driving system, reduces the strict distance of the vehicle.
According to the studies carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were released by this type of equipment could be limited to 1 100 dead accidents in the year related to the travellers.
The reduction of this number will still be more marked-by calculations, one of the four cases will be denied with a impact on persons after the introduction of such intellectual systems of manufacturers.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (aid radio or camera) will ensure transmissions and notify the driver, except the easy tracking.
If the driver reacts, he will help him to increase the button on the pedal if it's necessary.
If the driver doesn't respond, and it is even when the shooter can't be protected, the equipment uses something more intensively on the front and reduces the risk of accidents at the minimum.
General Motors bases the plan for Opel to the air
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of new Meriva will be started in the first week of April – probably 8 April – as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer notes that the plan of reform for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of the GM European company, is trying to first be agreed with the side that is concerned.
It is therefore possible that the final document that will first be presented to the employees and then governments of individual countries in which production branches will be issued by the beginning of 2010.
The GM Community also ensures that Saab’s sale decision should be adopted in these days.
It's not amazing that the Swedish government increased the pressure of the American manufacturer to make what he first took a certain decision.
The GM Community allows contacts with some new potential selling.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, however, considers the possibility of the Netherlands Skyper's Skyper's Sport producer, which cars under the Russian Converg Group.
If it is not possible to agree with no one of them, the GM company could sell some activity of Saab of the China Company Baic.
She still decided to close the end of the year of Saab if she doesn't happen.
Jída s Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this phenomenon model, the ingegners from Porsche used Boxster S as a base and made them to reduce the quantity of 80 kg, thus the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis, in the first section, the automatic loading steel is in the board with manual control, which was reduced by 21 kg; further was used the front doors such as for example. GT3, which means about 15 kg less; elimination of climates, 13; the reduction of pipes of 64 to 54 litres has also contributed to reducing the temperature of other 7 kg; the mounting of sport gates of 12 kg, from the 19-year columns of the 19-palts.
And finally, the removement of the audiosystic CDR-30 means the other six kilograms less and the replacement of the doors of textile efficients means another kilogram.
In addition, with a double transmission PDK, one vehicle was tested manually arranged with a six-grade speed range, especially on the other offices in California, on mountain shops with a lot of flexible boards.
His behavior may be qualified only as unnecessary.
The reduction of the substance does not mean that the vehicle is not printed to asfalt.
You know, exactly, we have been noticed so small and easy model, which would likely transform such security in the movement of the board, even in high speeds.
It's a small atlet able to buy swallows in a short ship after the needed time until we're organized with sprints, sprints and reuse of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the manager that is so communicative as exact, whatever we sign the hands on the volant is what the car will do.
And it's going to do with the chirurgical integrity.
Motor sound according to the vote
Sound V6 boxer, 320 horses (other 10 more than Boxster S), is a very adjustment and is able to facilitate the options 'sport' and the system that changes the engine sound that was used before in Panamer.
Capacity of acceleration is brutal, if you are already in construction or recuperation.
The locks are strong, but it's not certain or inadequate.
Asfalt's motors we're walking with Boxster Spyder was too defeated, but the car was well controlled.
The electronic support was almost unnecessary during the vehicle; and then we were cutting in some boards for lighting on the weight and the smoke even in the late afternoon.
Finally, this ultra-leading car is one of the best on the market, since it is more than the only modification of Boxster S.
The car shall be indicated to the sale in November 2010 for the price 70.831 €.
'Bag Girl'

Basconia has made a victory in Israel
The work facilitated a brilliant victory in 82-91 in his hosting on the complicated crystal of Maccabi Electra, in addition to reading absences in the type of Duska Ivanovice, and thus came to the role of his group after the great exemption of Miri Teletovice, which was the best exemption of the type (29 evaluation).
The type of Vitorie was able to replace a significant independenceHerrmanna, Olesona, Huertase or Micah’s large dose of concentration and collective work, although it had to end to get winning.
Furthermore, the greatness of the round of 16 third points was a lot of part of the final triumph.
He started the ground for blue, which had been set on a label from the beginning.
That the first four sheets for Vitoria were from the delay, they had already mentioned that they were attached to Israel's type very severe.
English and Teletovic looked between the main shot 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second fourth was similar, but the Alabam type decided for the internal game Baraca and Elijah's work, which was accepted by writers and pool when he returned to his original stage, to increase the output by the beginning of the transition (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to appear as the best in his type with 13 points, although no six' in the evaluation of Splitter had already stated that it would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although he was a warrant until the stop, it wasn't been decided even in the less and the Macabeans wanted to remind Vitorie that he didn't play everybody on their worms, and the Eliase's hand could play.
Eidson and Pnini have decisively contributed to return to the expenditure (50-49).
More inadequate
The members of Ivanovic, the suffering, but not even dead, needed a number of exact heroes to take the dark, and there appeared to be Mirza Teletovic, which had three three of the triangles almost after himself and with English and Ribase returned to a quiet number (54-67), which had received local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Albanians sitting in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to prepare them for the results of the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pni and Eidson, the best in their husbandship, did not get up and tried to maintain the type of life from three points (70-77).
In the midst of this, and with the Splitter who was exclaimed for fail, they didn't shoot and struck well, although the Israelites closed the end-minute minute (80-85), he had already wind and Tel Aviv was the first time for the meeting.
Disagreements are disagreed to fight Unica
Unicai was explicitly played in Greece with Olympiacos and left him leadership of the B group in Eurolyse in a box that was signed three attacks from Unicaia, but especially the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which helped Greek winds.
Malagy’s type has not been broken through Pavilon’s peace and friendship or support, maybe one of the patients in Europe, and with a great budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusans to sneak. Agressive protection and three third points after themselves, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guilma Rubia, separated the pitch from 12-18, minute 9.

Brazil states the date of Zelay's expenditure
The Brazilian Government established the period of meeting Manuel Zelayi at its majority in Tegucigalpa.
The Sex President must leave the diplomatic mission later on 27 January 2010 when his mandate is officially finished.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'Affaires of the Brazilian City in the Japanese main city, confirmed for TV Global that "Mel" knows that it must go to this date from the campaign where it is hidden from September 21.

Thank you
After the day of wine and growth from the past year, when the inflation of the inflation had represented the overridge of the markets, it was revealed to the markets that would not be surprised because it is already natural in the environment where the employees adopt future decisions that are not invisible for themselves.
The medicine used by the central banks for the stabilization of the market was to reduce the debt of the right purchase of a active and inappropriate liquidity in the nearly zero, so that the financial systems may buy activity to decline.
The central banks have already confirmed that the right purchases of activity have already been completed, and that they would not understood their insuranced liquidity policy, they begin to get a little piece to the society, as the Spanish Central Bank did with their accommodation in the long-term year.
Investors therefore doubt the capacity of world economy to maintain economic renews without such theerodox measures, and we participate in the reduction of risk costs.
The movement of smooth and the difference of the debt society has reached the points, although they are still very remotely non-normal levels, which have occurred at the beginning of the year.
The states were denied to socialize private risks, which had been revoked to the public agreement.
Again, the quality of the United States, Japan and Germany became the attack of the selected investors, which developed the differences of the euro area in the front of Germany.
Spain was almost unstabilized, but in that time Standard & Poor's arrived and restricted a new review to reduce the quality of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, certain disposal is not necessary for the reduction of moral risks that were trying to renew the conscience of persons responsible for the world's economy policy because of the suspicion of bad results of trust limits on employment when it was actually necessary to proclaim a new day of thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the smoking war between emergency rebuilding power in emergency, and what is about Greece, we have already seen before.
A government that covers deficit, choices and new government.
Prodi did this in Italy after Berluscoim and Socrates in Portugal after Duran Barros.
It does not mean Ecofin to save Hungary before the fulfillment of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the Member State of the euro to fulfil its obligations.
However, it is to use Ecofin the Greek Government to transparency and to carry out its own citizens to common responsibilities in the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public financials.
If, as we expect, we are looking forward to normalization periods of transitional risk, after some excess on supported positions would be in the framework of expectation.
In Spanish case, while our differences in public will be higher than the debts of the European society, we don't have to worry.
If the European differences are reduced and we will continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is only anexdote. When our previous indicator allows the majority of the study service to take their renewing scenarios and to revise their review scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to Japanese scenarios, for Spanish economy, it is a great hope for the fulfillment of this warning.
It looks like it's a great opportunity to buy the Spanish activist, but I'm using "obstantly, friend of managers."
Communication sectors
President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galan, as first yesterday, interacted before the subcommittee of the E-mail, where the energy strategy of Spain is made in the next two decades.
After its intervention, after the exhibition of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villassecy, Galan gave a number of notes on the proposal that subcommitted to the closed doors.
According to the President Iberdrola Spain, 50,000 million euros to 2020 and more 60,000 million from this date to 2030, if nuclear electricity is maintained immediately.
If it does not happen, the required investments will not be 60,000 million or 95 million.
Hyberdrola is truly considered that in the next decades the investment must be measured not to increase the capacity of production, except distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the question is changed and has to increase the exercise.
Its offer is focused on the floor and low electrical mechanisms with carbon oxyd and, in particular, renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that it needs new 18,000 MW, however with other support energy."
Galan, which is thinking that the law of maintainable economy that just approved the government, responds to the line that the business requested, would not want to depart as a king's decision on support of the consumption of national carbons, which resists the political fight against climate changes.
According to his opinion, "the clear long-term rate" in this meaning, in particular the "personal" measures as the President Iberdrola called.
In any way, Galan believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should be taken now, because their survey remains and is the necessary stabil framework for their launch.

The state of which it takes is the tunnel of 1,700 million Australian dollars (amount 1.047 million euros).
Their supports are the French Bouygues and German Hochtief.
A long-term tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east border has become the most closest opportunity for Acciona sitting in this country as a structural and consistency town.
The Council has the tunnel finished at the end of 2014

The Group named Transcity leads Action, the only Spanish company in the challenges, and its companies are BMD and Ghella.

The Protection of the Action Group is in the game of Concern Northern Direct with the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager of Transfield and the French Bouygues establishable group.
The third and last concert, which has passed through the network, has the name of LBRJV and shares on it the Australian capital Leighton (the first company of the German Staff Company Hochtief, here income ACS), also the local Baulderstone (the German group of Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialised on the civil state of Razel.
The Australian Infrastructure market promises a large statement and privatization, but it makes clear difficulty to enter into another way than to be inherited by the local structural company.
Strategy, which has been guided by Hochtief or Bilfinger, besides Asian references, is still a example for Spanish gigants in the sector.
ACS has received the position on the market through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton's entire company.
Million Activities
The action is based on the geographical area with the greatest significance for the given sector, where there is already a significant importance through its energy adding activities and in the area of solution.

His plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to enter the status and implementation of infrastructures.
The subterraneous path of the room, which is promotory, is the Office for the Infrastructure of Brisbane, named Northern Link (which south), has to link the west town from Toowong with a remote travel in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 miles of tunnel. It is the greatest action for reducing Brisbane transport transmission.
The calendar established by the local management plans for 2010 and the launch of work for the next year.
Although this placed travel would be opened in the last months of 2014, the full fulfillment of work is planned until 2016.
Tunnel began to project in 2005.
It shall contain two steels in each direction, the electronic and complex vessel system.

Accommodation of the ACS is driving through its local philosopher Leighton infrastructure of the national width floor network with a box with an optical flat.
This situation allows fast access to the Internet to 400,000 people and provides the work of Germany for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the project of King George's staff of 27 ships in the Australian city of Brisbane. The stave work had to start first and Hochtief closed for 129 million.

Game in the Champions list has been brought from the beginning of 476,4 million Madrid and Barce
The Liga of Masters became the source of receipts for these clubs from their relationship in 1992.
As Real Madrid and Barcelona did from that time 476,4 million, which makes the third and the fifth most training club.
My list is seeing Manchester United.
My list is seeing Manchester United.
It is also one of the main resources of acceptance for large clubs.
Finally, the cohesion has divided 5.362.5 million euros between 105 (except 12 Spanish), participated in this action from the relationship of tour in the 1992/1993 area, according to the EUFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelone went out of this division very well.
The white club was the third at the continent with the most money he received for participation, and the only one with AC Milan, who tried the main price.
Catalan's current campaign and the last winning of the occupied Europe in 1992 is in the Fifth class.
The list of Manchester United and Mnich Bayern, two types, which were more money to participate in the last Lize of Masters.
And that's how she both lost Barço.
On the other hand, Spain is to the third country that has received the most money through Champions, although most of all has received (5 against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This favourable paradox shall be explained by a comprehensive procedure for the distribution of the money used by the EUFA.
For this account year, the Board of Michel Platini has to make 1,090 million for Champions League.
From these money, the EUFA is $413,1 million to a fixed payment: each of 20 clubs participated in the previous classic round (including other Atletic Madrid) has received 2.1 million.
Except those who have received participation received 3,8 million only for their attempt, except 550,000 euros for each amount of participation.
It also exists preme for expenditure (800,000 euros) and for remise (400,000 for each type). Eight-financials will receive three million each; eight fourth-finalists3,3 million.
Each of the four last will get 4 million.
The campion is 9 million, while the second finalist is 5,2 million.
Thus, at a certain payment club, the club makes at least 7,1 million and maximum 31,2 million.
On the other hand, Barça received 2,5 million for the victory in the European superpower in August.
Moreover, there are mobile payments that are 337,8 million.
These money are divided according to the value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the mains, and he has four rooms.
The campaign from the lone year will be 40% of the payment of money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part shall be paid in accordance with the number of taxes that are reached in this year.

New vehicle evaluation tools
In these days, they're fighting and disagreements do not only autoservices.
Each day is thousands of cars who have succeeded a safe event, have been attached to the service where the detector has to deal with disasters and costs for transport.
No confidential event is the same and the calculation of the costs for parts and the time of work forces can be long and launched.
It may take two or three hours to calculate it manually from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and work forces.
However, with support of new computer tools, it would be a question of minutes
That is why at least 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Additional services and solutions for certain events and maintenance are collected by information that provide the manufacturers to produce and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spanish Audatex, from the American Solar Group is a leader company; 80% evaluation is conducted with its products.
Other companies involved in the field of assessment and processing information on sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work of the data that provide the manufacturers is not easy.
According to Eduarda Velázquez, the business director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers, and each of them provides information in another format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to process is still grown, since in the past five years more versions, variants and motor solutions have been indicated than in the past 15 years.
As the new vehicle comes into the market, these companies will start working.
It's about a very timework, because it's necessary to catalog each one of thousands of vehicles and to determine its price.
Moreover, in each model, "inteligent" graphical processing is conducted, where it is possible to "cover" individual parts of touristic cars.
If it's a model with massive sale, the work can be ready for week if the process is very quick.
If you are about a small car, you can keep three or four months. Actually, Audatex has full information on 99,2% cars sold in Spain.

National seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than one hundred technology (normally mechanics) works together with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year to the processing of these databases.
Every month, 2,5 million of data and clients are updated every two days.
The processing of this increasing production of information allows enterprises to use and provide various products.
The most frequent use is focused on transport and maintenance, but, according to individual countries, there are also tools for the management of replacement or for the calculation of carriers or the remaining values.
The only company that is available is Eurotax, is Eurotax, which reports the value of the vehicles used in Spain.
Audatex is not in our country, but in the United States yes.
With the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get a support that can use professionals in the sector.
This undertaking provides ten different instruments, including the star product is AudaPlus, the standard solution of the assessment of certain events defined for knowledge.
Increasing cars, motocicles and easy and hard industrial vehicles.
Furthermore, the costs of the part also includes the time to replace the manufacturer or the lake.
This tool shall be paid in accordance with the use of each evaluation.
The highest price is $5,75 € for the clients who use it less, maximumly ten times per month.
Then, every insurance that carrys thousands of debts is exposed to its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow full identification of vehicles and devices that have gone out of the mounting line only based on the first number of transport.
AudaGlass is focused on the car clue and AudaSubastas is open to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to organise vehicles with a total safe event.
His statistical service is very useful for the identification of tendency, conducting geodemographic analysis or detecting the decline according to tags or models.
For example, it may be possible to study how many model tags have passed through the service because of the hazard or how many serious events have suffered for certain periods.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish business that is developing this type of tools.
Furthermore, Gt Estimate is sold, which also is defined for knowledge and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.

The operation was proposed to increase 59,5 million € from 85% of the company capital, which could increase in the next year of resident 15%.
The purchase target was to provide more services with the additional value of customers with the possibility of access to a large international market.
This service for evaluation and purchase and selling is handled exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance, knowledge, officers, services, selling resources and professional vessels that must be registered before the start of operation.
This platform took place in 1996 in Germany and leads more than 650,000 operations in all Europe, from 500,000 in Germany.
In the middle of the main market, Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are excluded.
The Web has more than 1,500 registered vessels and 4,000 characters.

According to the Spanish law, the car which the number of transport was issued could not be returned to the operation, but it can be used as the source of resources that were not been cut off.
The horses with historical value may be allowed to carry out, although they were arranged after the previous management.
Number of service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller company Audatex, the user will only be calculated in four steps: IDs of the vehicles, search of the replacement party, creation of the budget generation budget.
The use of use is the basic conditions for these systems, especially for the survey of professionals in higher or smaller age, which are maintained in use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1.034 vehicles from 666, 109 teren, 137 motocycles, 78 additives and 44 stones.
Natural to use is required a computer with Internet connection.
After identifying the model to be designed, using the number of the currency, the real graphical display of the model will appear and then the required replacement is selected.
The user can attach the variable as the price of work forces, payments or skins, and then print and transfer to the register.
AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment such as AudaPlus, even though reference directory.
The main difference between both systems is that it is orientated on the services and does not cover the disabilities of work forces.
The payments for the use of this party tool are 350 € per year, which the register can finance.
At the time, Audatex business works for this view to be three-minutely.
This is the innovation that the mechanisms welcome because it is able to choose the port and turn them to be broken in the internal side.
