At the noise call, the professor recognised that he shot his friend.
In the call on the new line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted the police to shoot his friend and needed to come home to them.
Lamb suggested that his "beloved dog" was living and probably disappointed, and that a dead woman's family could find on her phone.
Inside the police, Amy Prentis' body found and manually written a report on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I'm sure I could return, I loved Amy and she was the only one who loved me," remained in a letter that signed by the officers of Lamb.
There was no doubt that Lamb, who taught two online coffees for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school camp, where the police thinks that he shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office.
The police officer in Delta State University Lynn Buford said that the university's employees heard the shooting at 10:18 later.
Lamb first made a phone on a new line shortly later.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after shooting in school, students and faculty used to hide their closed doors, the competent authorities still try to ask what Lambova was motivation.
The detailed details that published researchers on the side of the State and students and employees who knew him were made together a talented image but probably a problem teacher.
Students confirmed that they were happy for his lecture.
The police in Gautier, where Prentis died, confirmed that there was no records in the crime record or violence.
Schmidt himself took the Lamba into the book he wrote, thanks to the "great people" with which he shared academic life.
Both of them were taught on social science and history, together with other 17 members of the faculty and many students walked on the board at the same time.
The inclinations were also produced in the case of the problems.
Student who rejoiced the Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he's also cut off and threatened, "It's like something wouldn't be okay with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, told him that Lamb told him that he's on the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already requested Delta State University for freedom of health reasons when he made a problem.
And this year he learned only two online cows.
Recent changes on the Universal Officer's Advisory Affairs were signed that a doctor on which Lamb was hard to work in order to not close the automatic functional time to become a professor assistance.
The President of the University William LaForge pointed out that he didn't know any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba seemed to be a threat."
The Lamb doesn't answer us to these questions.
After he went out of the campus, the police took his feet back when Archansas' border was back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was killed by the only gun on the door of his parents at Greenville in Mississippi, and confirmed the corner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
The car was launched on the street.
It wasn't clear now why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said he probably knew people who lived here.
Lamb has grown up in this country.
Lamb started working on a university who has 3500 students in the city who read about about 12000 citizens in 2009 and taught landscape and education hours.
He got a doctor in education.
One of the long friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and smart man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambo 20 when they met through joint friends.
She was with his friends in the middle school, and he was the great old boy who taught her a few years to play the kitter.
It was a very lamb of heart that was then.
The heart of all girls found how much she was found," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives on Jackson's subject.
Lamb and Prentis went along some time.
During the noise phone Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but I never had a record about the dinner.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a circle house that seats with the Gautier River.
The police said the dog's okay.
He was a husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, which is now 19 years old.
"It's been totally threatened," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
́Steen said he didn't sit with Lambe, but by his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb meeted Princess when Abigail and Abigail went up to the plane for three years ago.
Afterward, they played a suitable gig together.
́Steen said his daughter writes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a healthy sister who worked for various online companys.
Mike Shaffer, barman and the opportunity coordinator of the room in the Julep Room, with a light bar near Gautier, said that last saw Lamba and Prentiss in September 5.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We laughed and played together with a whistling.
I mean, they both had a good sense for humor.
Schmidt, a killer, led a seminar in the first year and specialized the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor on school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of the guy's student club and the government of students.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on the night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and members of the community, participated with the memories of the lights.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in Vigilence, during which the universe congregation took "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
She started in the middle of school again.
"We're trying to return our students," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Bibles for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Ptoutes in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this report.
This story was made to reflect the fact that the police now states that Lamb made a new line after Schmidt killed, and that Lamb called his wife Prentis, there is no evidence that they were actually meetings.
Toys R Us plans less sezon workers
Toys R Us claims that there are no longer so-called workers as last year, but the manufacturers of children players and products say that they give the current employees and social workers the opportunity to train more hours.
The Community also concluded that it plans at least 40 000 employees to work in trade and distribution centres throughout the whole country, which is a range of about 45 000 last sessions.

Michael J. Fox's fun about her 'rande' with the princesa Diana
The first "Return to the future" was a great professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was aware of personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a miracle and waiting for the coming of the King's family when I realized that she was sitting near me was empty and I came to sit there, Princess Diana," he said, "Return in time."
The movie begins and I'm sure I'm going to get something that would be called a false random with the princess of Wales.
"Return in the time," is the document of "Return to the future", which introduces talking with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and also a register of Robert Zemeckis and a manufacturer of Steven Spielberg.
The first "Return for the future" was 30 years ago.
Playberg said, "It's actually the best way document that was filmed."

The Boss of the United Nations says that there is no military solution in Siria
The General Secretary of Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's rapid military support for Syria is that "no military solution" is the conflict of nearly fifty conflict and more weapons are only worried by violence and suffering millions of people.
The Boss of the United Nations revoked all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to ensure and support the inclusive action on finding political solution.
Ban said to the Central Print Conference that he was in the plan to meet the Ministry in the field of five permanent advice of countries - United States, Russia, China, British and France - at the front of the ministerial meeting of the Valent meeting at the end of this month because of the situation in Siria.

Ban invited five staff members to demonstrate solidarity and units showing that when the Iran Nuclear Agreement was achieved in the Crisis in Siria.
8 optional numbers showing that Donald Trump in real light
Some tried to mark him as a person who often changes the views.
Others over the little hands like the unbelievable amusement.
And some are prepared for improving.
But if some of the republists are trying to download Donald Trump down from the top of the choice, they will not happen.
10 of the last 11 national researchs show that Donald Trump is in the direction of a double number, and some people are starting to ask seriously what it means for the nominal chance of this magnetic magnetic magnetic field.
Of course, it's still the beginning of the choice cycle.
Nothing of this says that Trump probably wins a republic nomination.
Experts show that in 2011 Rick Perry's ruling to Herman Cain, no one of them had played the only position in the nominal process.
There are many reasons why it could be increasing in general options.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bushe and the Club for Growth's Economic Conservative Group are conscious of Trompo's willing to keep and start paying their dollars on the same objective.
There are some recent voting numbers that indicate that real magnetic magnetic is not only a mixed phase:
Thumbnail evaluation was turned to 180 degrees.
Before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the half of June, Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have positive views on this real magnetic magnetic.
In half of June, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now he has six of 10 republists a positive view of Donald Trumpa.
Three of the ten says they have negative views on him.
And these numbers are maintained in the beginning phases.
After the voting of the University of Quinnipiac, which has passed last week, discovered that 60 per cent of the Republics had a positive opinion on the Trumpa.
Two third-term GOP pills would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
The CNN/ORC announced last week, 67 per cent of the republished republished that they would be "forward" or "comfortance" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 said they'd be "shoted" from his candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same level of survey as Trump (43 percent people said that they would be "except" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next level of supervision?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican volators say that they would be "happily" or "resolved", if they would favor Jeb Bush become a candidate.
Most of the Republics do not see the temperature of Trump as a problem.
While Donald Trump was criticized for his emergency and urgency, 52 per cent of the republican volators is totally attached to the thought that reality has a right temperature for the president, according to the Monday ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the Senator State Club of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country where 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the officer, according to Quinipiac from the past week.
However, 44% thinks he does not have personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 of 10 independents say that his temperature does not correspond to the white house, according to ABC/Post.
Republican choices are usually normal on this thought.
When they put their students, the Republican elections think that Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who, with the greatest probability of GOP names, four of 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC investigation last week.
It's a change from the late June when four of the 10 sold their money on Jeba Bushe.
Complete publication: The GOP choices did not have in the past the most clear cross.
At this time, 4 of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a candidate leader against 28 percent for the eventual name of Mitta Romney.
However, there is a certain number of GOP pills see the Trumpa campaign as faithful.
Although the Republics were gathered together around another candidate, Trump will take almost every one.
Some training points out that the distributed field is likely to contribute to Trump, while anti-Trumpovy support is diffusionally broken between more than the tact of other candidates.
But the research of Monmouth University from the beginning of September shows that in the hypothetical right comfort between Trump and the majority of other Republic candidates, Trump has almost a major support.
Carly Fiorina on 13 points, Marc Rubi of 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bushem on 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Christ of 33 points at each point.
He's in the dead ship with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who brings him?
Ben Carson would lead over the businessman on the wide 19 points in the hypothetical front of one against one.
The majority of Donald Trumpa says that they have already made their opinion.
The new external CBS/NYT investigation indicates that only more than half of the Trumpa supporting Trumpa is not changed.
Of course it can change a lot of things, and no one can really say that he would never change his opinion.
46 per cent indicates that they have the open back back to change between candidates.
However, Trump's current most strongest opponent of his Aussider colleague neurochirurg Ben Carson, but the choices who consider their opinion for the end would go two times more likely to call for Trompa.
6 of 10 of the Republics agree with Trump on the question of immigration.
Even from the moment Donald Trump called Imigrants from Mexico "silters" in his statement of the campaign with the immigration continues to keep as the main and center theme of conversion for 2016.
Some are afraid that Trump's embarrassment disappears the keys of the Spanish aircraft from the Republic and the rebranding.
However, according to the new Monday investigation of ABC/Post, six of 10 republists state that it agrees to Trump in questions of approach.
It seems that until the theme of the immigration remains in the area of reflectors, Donald Trump will also remain.
Government's branch has new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today get half support from the parts of the Republic Heavens, and this is especially regarding their state of outsides.
Six of 10 republists in the new lunch vote ABC/Post says that they want more political outside than someone with government experiences.
And they're also very disappointed in Washington.
The voting of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago, three of the four Republics in Iowa were frustrated in the Congress, 54 per cent is "behaviour" and 21 per cent "plexed."
The smoking supported the larger part of the State from the pockets of the carbon.
The Chess gets more than 400 million.
The first reading sentence supported the Government Novie of the Supreme Law, which ensures the higher rate of charges from the surface difficulties of sustainable pollution from several companies.
Mr. Jan Mladek (CHSSD) promised to the apostles that they receive money as a State bank, as well as a foreign budget.
The proposal was criticised by the elders of the obsession that fear that the hard companies would not want to monitor the aliens as well as the same, because they would pay higher funds directly to the State budget. In the first reading, the Government's news of the Supreme Law, which, except the other, means that the State should receive a largest part of the expenditure of the proposals from the higher difficulty of carriage from the companies.
The part of the State is increased to 67%, while the part of the stranger is reduced from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculation of the border for non-grossed companies.
The changes in non-creasing levels shall be brought to the State bank over 427 million corners in 2013.
In the achievement of the budgets of the aliens, it has a negative impact in the government because the payment must be higher.
In the past year, there were 450 million corners and 150 million corners.
From the difficulty of the cold carbon was about 200 million corners and 66 million corners.
The New Computes and increases the frontiers of the home space with a difficult rate for 1000 corners for one hector per year.
The Annex from this office is still in full field to be foreign.
The Ministry of the Industrie of Jan Mladek (CHSSD) said to the messengers that the others have been achieved in place of 14 million to 100 million corners in the year.
The higher difficult funds will not be determined by the law, but the Government shall establish it by its Regulation.
The reputation shall be calculated as a consisting of a number of disagreements and assets for individual kinds of disease.
According to the Government, there is a reason for changing the possibility of urgent reaction on the current economic situation.
The OS Marek Benda messenger warned that the regulation of the Government should not be complied with the approval.
However, according to the Ministry of Justice, it is not in this case because the State pays the weakness that is the State's owner.
The grounds reach only foreign, where the fields are difficult.
In the case of deep diseases, three fourth money will be obtained foreign and fourth state.
The same amount will also be in the case of the difficulty of radioactive horns.
The part of the money that is stated on the grounds of difficulties will be able to take place.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be carried out by hardship or to ensure the safeguard services.
The proposal was criticised by opposite messengers who declared, in particular, that the aliens were able to disturb the difficulties and countries.
For example, Michal Kučara (TOP 09 and Starost) warned that hard companies will not want to monitor the aliens as well as still, because they will pay higher payments directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunel one of the most highest regions only to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Usvit) chosen in the East country.
Before the growth of unemployment on the Moscow, KSCHM Hana Aulick was warned.
Kadner and Aulick proposed unfortunately to reject the news, Kučara wanted to return the government to work.
In the ground report, the increase of charges is not allowed to carry prices because the prices are more than 90 percent of long-term.
The main consumers as electric or temperature should therefore not feel price growth.
"In the other hand, this fact increases the risk that difficult organizations will compense the office to compense the efforts to reduce their employment costs, which would be particularly significant to reduce the number of employees," the Government applies.
However, there is an increase in the employment employment.
According to the reports of Milan Urban (CHSSD), the messengers are key to recognize the conclusions on the updated energy concept and mainly the decision of the Government on the limits of illness.
If it's a threat to do so for limits, then it's gonna have an impact on the costs for State and foreign, he's raised up.
Urban does not agree to the young man in that the decision on the limit of the Czech Slovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the CSA should have already been proceeded for the causes of social, national economy and for the reason of long-term stability of tumor energy.
The joy will lead to Cheche as a single piece, the setting of the effects of the time.
All four Czech tennises are shown in the fourth distribution of the bargain of Davis in India on the table, and this time every one of them will not be driving in games.
Captain Jaroslav Returned plans that, in consideration of difficult conditions, the entire quartet is in charge.
In Dillia, the hork and high depth of air, so they are expected to be able to travel up to five cents.
We have to get it in the ship.
I'd like to make it easy according to the time.
And according to what it looks like, he said to Return to the Czech Trinity in the center of Radge Kumara Khanny.
With one team and the world's fourteenth Jirjam the Great is counted in the fifth and neighborhood two.
On the position of two, Luke Rosol and Radek Stephan.
I'd like to get them almost everybody.
I've got it a little bit in my head, but I'm not going to say it, he said.
Another survey in the Czech meeting should be a party of Stephana in the fourth Sunday.
It is only a question who will stand next to the tempered devil, which has in Davis’ ship in the fourth quarter of the office 18:4.
It's a pleasure.
They stay with Rosal, or Adam Paul.
"I really don't know who and how it looks," he said.
It shall be decided in accordance with the emission of two.
A variant may be Pauls, who were surprised in the 1th round in the Development of Australian.
"He's in a debt pleasant," he rejected.
I've done this, and if I'm playing, I'd like to bring the same exercise that I've shown from the second seat.
"I like these experiences and I want to bring a point," said the Paul.
The house sets up to the twoer Yuki Bhambrio (125 in ATP chamber), which played the last week Challenger in Shanghai, where he struck the third and fourth hundred of the players.
Two will be Soudev Devvarman (164).
They both are challengers and ours have experiences from ATP Tour, but we have already convinced that the challengers in Davis' jail are not resolved.
"He decides a momental form, time," said Returned.
Fifteen officers start at 6:30 SEL Č and can be able to get up because of the time.
According to the proposal, he's not under the throat.
However, playing can be cased for a artificial light.
They've already got it, and there's two thousand luxuries that's enough.
"It should be done to play under light," said the Returned.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on the Prime Minister's Questions
From your choice, Mr. Corbyn is very excited in PMQ.
The New Working Leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debat in the Prime Minister's Questions later, and first will have collaboration with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn puts the first of its six added questions shortly afternoon, while it's likely to be investigated by media and messengers.
In a weekly explanation, he asked "besides a wonder and more facts."
He also showed that he could overcome several meetings that would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby, which comes after its name to the branch cabinet and its outstanding speaking to the TUC original congress.
The labour leader’s decision states in silence during the song of the national hymne in the service in the absence of the 75th opportunity. The Great Britain's age was confronted with criticism from a series of concerts and is in the middle of a number of history on the title pages of news.
Mr Corbyn decided not to sing the national hymn to himself.
Mr. Corbyn said he'd stay in the steadfast smoking and recognizes that he'd be "the King Aeroport in the battle of the United Kingdom."
However, the member of Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, shared the BBC You's Newsnight, that the labour leader recommended to sing the national hymn to his convince that the monarchie should be interrupted.
As long as thousands of office ministers denied to serve at the top of Mr Corbyn team, they quoted the difference in the economic, protection and foreign agencies, and only less than six parties of the Parliament had originally supported him as a leader.
Political Corresponder BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "good" after Mr. Corbyn's name by its position in the European Union and the government limits of the dose.
Mr. Corbyl said to the TUC Conference that the Department Site had amended amended proposals to remove the entire thoughts of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the secretary of the training work and the reviews that the page "excellently clear" rejected government plans to reduce the limit of 26,000 £ to $23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the Fifth Leader of the Delean Party, which David Cameron was raised for the last decades from his election as a concert leader.
The leader of the employees who promised a different access to the police says that he has the ideas "of dawn" for the questions of Mr Cameron and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
MP Islington North says that PMQ is too confronted and that it is holding as "the response of the bonds," such a low trade, and instead he promises that they are focused on important problems such as poverty, inequality and excuses of young people.
Mr. Corbyn says that Angela Eagle, the branch business secret, will apply it to PMQ if it is not involved, for example, when Mr Cameron goes to the border.
He also stopped the thought that other colleagues would leave him to get out of time for him because he had heard that he had still discussed with John Bercow's dream.
When Mr. Cameron was a leader in 2005, he said that he wanted to decline from the "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often connected to PMQ, but for a few years later allowed him to miss.
Since their first sentence in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barmeter of the leaders, their dreams and their positions between other MPs, although critics argued that they were carried out and needed a lot of reform.

In contrast of the construction that has to be excited in the low neighborhood of the Anesh Cloister in the Centre of Praha, protested before the Prague Office of 1 hundreds of people, took and asked.
The Master of the Decision concluded that the statutory law had not been maintained by all the opportunities of the field decision.
"The preceding area decision does not contain some opportunities, for example, the type of grounds, the distances from suburbs, sufficiently clearly and comprehensively described by buildings, the extent of the field affected by the establishment," writes in its Decision.
It is also considered that certain principles for decision-making have been provided to the original documentation that has been modified.
It is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
The part of the structures must be affected by the National Gallery, but the investor has no valid agreement.
The write material claims that, however, the owner of the grounds has only submitted a agreement with the project documentation for the ground management, not agreed with the location of the statutes on its grounds, write the structure of the structure.
According to Francesca August Razetta from the investors' investors' Agency of the Statutive Agency, the Ministry for Local Development has not been understood by the decision of the Governing Board - the Ministry for Local Development, in accordance with the period of the restart of the Research.

Berg went to Hungary with the purpose of bringing humanitarian aid to humanitarian help.
On the road, he took three syrical rings together with a driving car, who wanted to spend about half miles.
Then, according to him, it wasn't in Hungary, he told Lid's news.
We knew that the customers of the law did not have such actions.
But when the policemans stopped us, to our surprise, they stopped us and sent us to the investigation treatment in the Szeged, he wrote the letter.

In the middle of them, he was a two-year-old boy or a four-year girl.

Metcash takes the campaign on the outside to fight with Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash takes the campaign on the outside to fight with Aldi invasion
While Aldi is prepared to open two distribution centres and first of more than 120 businesses in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen the relations with local additives and build the IGA tag through the marketing in mainstreams and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA businessers and additives are added to marks as it is based on Dunsborough, the Symmo's defense of the IGA businesses and the managers of the businesses are sold a low letter on the Australian photoball ligue to the local recorders.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the sale of food, alcohol and hardware will spend its yearly investors' strategic day.
It is much because South and West Australia represent at least 30 per cent of Metcash IGA trade steps and generate higher resistance than the Metcash IGA network in East States.
Providers in South and Western Australia are nottorically provincial and IGA trades use more stronger market shares than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA in comparison with about 14 per cent in East States.
Each analytical as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi is 5% of the food market in these two States during 12 months since the opening of the first trades that have exceeded markets from all existing players, but principally independently independents.
This week in his analysis Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, declared that IGA could lose 360 million USD for an annual sale and Metcash 250 million USD at the end of 2016.
This proposal is based on the proposal that Aldi will open 25 businesses in South Australia and 30 in the west of the next year, and will generate 500 and 600 million USD in individual markets.
The loss of food vessels and debts in a certain price base of Metcash could be able to stay around 13 million USD for the costs before the opinion, Mr. Kierath confirmed.
Metcash was currently lost part of the markets in East States, especially against Aldi and Coles, although the last investigation of Roy Morgan found that the purchasers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks that the vessels of Metcash sells 3,8 per cent in 2016, 4,1 per cent in 2017 and 2,1 per cent in 2018, and its share in the market is reduced from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10,3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the manager of the funder of Hamish Douglass, the Magellan financial group, said that the commercial foods in Melbourne could "hopely remotely during the decades.
Metcash refused publicly to respond to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that the member of the representative of Metcash contacted Douglassse last week.
The IGA range of 18 per cent to 14 per cent from 2010 and the expenditure of Metcash's vessels, which adds at least 1200 IGA drivings , has falled at 43 per cent from 2012, which reduces the development of speculation changes, because the sale and costs are under the pressure.
However, the largest trade has gone to the anti-country and invest more than 150 million USD in the year to equival the pool prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundred products each week and helps IGA's small markets to rebuild the trades by adding rapid growth and news from privates.
The Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, says that the price equipment and equipment of trade programmes will take place and hope that the biggest returns to the basic growth of profit in 2017 first for four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported President Tennis Australia Stevem Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis serves for his behaviour of honor less than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a closer loss at the recent time of his friend Nick Kyrgiose and serves for his behaviour as long as critical, President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duty often called "Special Ks", was invited to himself a unbelievable attention for the afera with the unknown Kyrgios and the state of Wawrinca on Montreal Masters.
Shortly, in your high qualitative excuses in Cincinati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his supporter Ryan Harrison two times decisive, and then Harrison said, "Wawrinka had one of them to get to Kirgios and I had to take him also."
While he was recently seen how they broke the racket after the crowd hit him the possible capable of Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Kokkinakise obviously refused Healy.
The younger is currently in Glasgow, where Sam Grotham supports the location in the second side of Bernard Romic in the seminar Davis Cupu against British.
"I was very intensely thinking that Thanasi was a little injured to all the sports," says Healy.
He destroyed the racket when he lost the crowd in the U.S., but not the first player who would be able to cut off his racket. I know Thanasi's very well and I can say that this event will not be honorable.
But he was seriously controlled very well because he was established in the United States with a very professional circumstances because of Harrison and so further, so, according to my opinion, he serves a great reconnaissance.
He's a fantastic team around himself, and he's also a great family around himself, and I think he's been coming with him out of a matter of hardness.
It's a very adult 19, works very hard, and it's a great team, and so then, never had any problem with other players, in the cloud is very respected, treated hard, is in a wonderful condition, it's a very stabil and growing young boy, and I'm so short thinking that you're served to be judged according to their own service.
Healy also supported the decision to look at Kyrgiose because of the important safeguard beginning at the fifth, and indicates that the "including decision" is a right solution for all, but supports Canberry's road to return to the team as a long-term staff.
"First of everything, we want to have our team just focused on the board and not on all the controls that [Kyrgios] took around him," says Healy.
And I think that Nick stayed very quickly as Federer, Murray and other people show, in the eyes of public grows fast, he also made a few terrible errors and serves all the crisis that he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes out of explanation when he's able to think about it, it's my view of the best solution for the ones and also for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares the noise status, closes the borders and keeps migrants
After the warning of Hungary's disaster, his south border closed with Serbsk and stopped those who tried her illegal way to stop enough migrants.
At the border, the caos was raised, while hundreds of migrants were gathered together in the country of no one and the Serbian authorities reacted immediately.
Those who have seen the unknown time in the land fields between two States stand those who flee from violence in families will stand and live.
But it comes to feel frustration.
When the helicopter is over them, the migrants call together "Open the borders" and give a ordinary unity of the Hungarian police.
Some of the protest reject food and water.
The Serbian Ministry of the province states that it was "inacceptable" to be sent back from Hungary, while they still come from Macedonia and Greek.
(Sorbska) He wants to be part of the solution, not only to reavoid.
In other days, Ivica Dacic will need to discuss Brussels and other countries," says Ivic Dacic in Praza.
Nothing at the Hungary-Sorb border has come on the day after the block 28 states have not arrived with a single immigration policy to continue meetings in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibilities for 40,000 people who search for protection in the surprised Italy and Greece and have spoken with the hope of a event agreement for another month or the end of the year that the EU countries would accept more than 120 000 other guarantees, including Hungary.
The German Federal officer Angela Merkel and Rakous called a special EU summit for another week to discuss continently surgical crisis.
However, Hungary had no hope on Brussel or his neighbors.
The internal state of disagreement in two southern regions gave the authorities a greater power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the streets and to accelerate the court cases of axile.
In the middle of the Hungary Foreign Ministry Peter Sychijarto said that his country also plans to build a road from the southern road by the border with the Romans to stop the surroundings that are trying to transite through their land when it is now finished to plot on the silver border.
CBS News co-responsant Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to get a rent travel between Hungarian and Serbsk.
In the past months, Hungary became the main slambin and the income point to the European Union for the surroundings from which many fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
The President of the Government of Viktor Orban, however, remained that most of them are economic migrants who follow better life and not military exploitors who seek protection, which are clearly different from other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws that have entered into the north of Hungary are now criminalizing the 4 meters of the floor that the Government has left to set on the south border with Serbska, and also establishs further periods in prison for those who are illegally transformed.
"Thanks the situation of the mass migration of Hungary Government speaks the state of trouble," said the reporter of Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Száed.
In this, we have very clear: the illegal translation of the border is crime.
Technically, the Parliament must still apply the army's staff waiting for the next week, but the reporters of Associated Press at the border observed several weapons with vehicles and hunters for a few days ago.
Gyorgy Bacondi, advisor Orbana for household defence, said that the authorities had taken 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 were already captured in the country.
Proceedings through the smoking of the plant, and now are accused of the police officers to execute crimes according to new laws.
The offices were quickly allowed to control.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border transitions with Serbska in the morning after using a striking car.
At the main border transition in Roske came chaos because the Hungarians opened a small office in the cow container for processing and removed the bottom of people.
Anyway 20 came inside, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of eggs locked the main towns associating Serbs and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Options 2016: Hilllary Clinton's Stock before Bernie Sanders was decreased at half in national vote
The Ministry of Hillary Clinton is still holding a double-cipher in the Democratic Democratic Affair on the nomination on the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gets her smoke.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of democratic primary choices (pocles of 58 per cent), while Sanders are at the second place with 27 per cent (amount of 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who still needs to notify whether he wants to be president, has a support from 15% of the Democratic Primary Chocolates.
More than five months before the start of the main challenges, the democraticest choicer says that it is too soon to say that they are clearly decisions of the candidate to support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From the CBS News anket from the past month, Clinton lost Clinton's feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders got some.
Clinton keeps a big shot between women and decreases, but her guidance is deceived.
Her support between men was explicitly reduced and Sanders lost her only five points.
Clinton's agreement with democratic choices under 50 years has been explored and now Sanders are equal.
Clinton still has a great guidance for the elders.
Last month Clinton had a double-cipher smoking before Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders lost in this group only five points.
At least half democratic primary volators in all States says that Clinton would be more supporting Clinton if it would be a candidate of the parties.
The fourth would support her with certain expenditures and other 15 per cent would support her only for the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It is probably not surprised that Clinton's current advocates are particularly injury.
The views are sensitive among those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only fourth would have been very supporting it.
While 48 percent of democratic primary volators says that Clinton would be highly supported, less republic choices say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's advocates are asked in the open question, why they want it as a candidate, the most frequent answer is that they have the right experience (16%), it follows that it is time to be a President (13%), and that he is the best candidate for this work (10%).
Clinton's friends also reduce her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Next, the great opportunity of choice and agreement on problems is cited.
While the Vice-President considers the potential candidate to the President, 57 per cent of the democratic primary volators would be pleased to get into that chair - third thinks that it would not be a candidate.
When the primary democratic electors were asked who would choose as a second choice for the name of the parties, the most common choice is Biden.
In the middle of Clinton's consciousness, he brought more than half of Biden as their second choice, far away from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to conceal the nomination of the Democratics, Hillary Clinton's leader will be expanded from 20 points when Biden will conceal, 30 points without his candidate.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic volators see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunity for the expenditure in all options; however, this number has fallen from 78 per cent of the past month.
Biden is in this measure along the second, but the percent of people who see him as probably chosen.
However, when the majority of the candidate's question, the democratic elections give the presence of the solution of problems before the greater chance of choice.
Like the past month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate does not appear as an inacceptable candidate for this primary volatory.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between the primary choices of their parties.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as faithful and trusted and think they have strong leader quality.
Bid of all three leads in truth, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of democratic primary volators don't think Clinton's honourable and confident, so two times than those who say the same about Sanders (15%), but 27% does not have this opinion.
Primary democratic electors also see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in accordance with their ideal view.
As regards all these measures, the fourth democratic choices have no opinion on Sanders.
As regards the decision of Hillary Clinton on the use of its personal e-mail and the server as State secrets continue, most of the primary democratic choices are satisfied with its explaining this matter and say that it has not affected their total view.
But between America's publicity, it's totally different story.
The half of the Americans is now unfaithful with her explanation, while only the third is satisfied.
The public comments on this subject were already divided in March as soon as this problem has gone out.
Most of the Americans say that this e-mail control does not have any effect on their full view on Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton has been disturbed.
It's mainly about the Republics, where more than 6 of 10 says that their opinion on Clinton has been disappointed.
Although Clinton is a honourable and confident one of the electorers of her parties, this question is still a problem between registered electoral entirely: only 32 per cent sees it as a honourable and confident, which is attached to eight points from the last month, and at 15 points from May.
Seventy-two percent of registered volators don't think it's honorable and confident.
At the same time, 55% of the registered volators throughout the country are not also seeing the Trumpa as a honorable and confident.
But Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
From six tested candidates, they were the best in honor by Biden, Carson and Bush.
Sanders see more people as honorer than unclean, but, as in Carson, many choices have not considered him.
The errors in the form of 351 primary democratic choices are 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended after Donald Trump in national choices.
Ben Carson is closed to Donald Trump in the recent CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of volators in the latest investigation and others allow support.
Republican volilers from a series of republics throughout the country and continue to support the Drug Trump in the majority, and 23% of the support in the last CBS investigation carried out before the Debatte of Fox News last month, at 27% in the worst.
But Carson was shooting from 6 to 23% in the same time.
The investigation also discovered that Carson leads better to demographic groups, and establishs the Trump between the universally educated republic electors.
The rest of the fields, except Carly Fiorin and the Governor of the State of Ohio John Kasiche, is behind with the Wikiconsin Governor Scott Walker, full of 10% of support, has fallen to the current 2%.
It was the Governor Florida Jeb Bush, the old Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and the Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in the third place 6%.
The exchange of errors in the model 376 of the Republic electors in the new investigation is more than 6%, and it was held in September.
The most recent CNN/ORC investigation, published last week, showed that Carson was pulled up and had 19% support between the Republics for Trompan 32%.
The most recent investigation from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was explicitly before Carson.
At Carson’s continent trend, Trump decided to shoot the neurochirurg in the service, and even Carson pardoned for the audiences about the Trump's faith.
"We need energy," announced Trump last Sunday during the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brothership have been condemned by the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
At least two years after student died during the persecution of the brother's ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pensylvania, a condemnation of murder against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi were brutally attacked Chuna "Michael" Denga during the beginning of the prison in September 2013 and left him to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, announced the police.
The police states that he had an eye locked, he had a full piece of piece of entire weapons of 30 liter and was repeatedly troubled when he tried to go to the target over the dead field.
Mr. Deng finally struck his head's pain and then fell into unbelievers.
The members of Pi Delta Psi didn't call 911 immediately after Deng was departed, and waited for an hour before they sent him to the hospital, they said the police.
However, they found time to overcome Dengo's clothes, spread his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the entire president of the brothers, and ask him on the Council, he brought the police counseler Chris Vagner to the print conference.
"In this time the members began to hide the exploitation and, basically, gave the presence of the welfare of the brothership before Michael Denga," said Wagner.
He couldn't be able to survive, and he died the second morning.
According to the Pitt News, Deng was repeatedly arrested by a thick subject to head, thief and stand.
"A lot of families have been discovered in the consequence of persecution in brethren and at least one student will die every year because of the persecution since 1970," wrote Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer of Dengo's family, in the statement.
Brothership and their members must be responsible and this step is important from the parties of the authorities.
The Great Court of Monroe County recommended a decree of murder in third party for the first five members.
Thirty-two other brothership members, including Mr Menga, will also be offended by the attack of persecution and criminal collection.
"We want to keep not only participated persons, but if there is an organization that has approved it, to be officially or officially, we will also offer them to the responsibility," said Wagner at the outside print conference.
Baruch College denied the brotherness and the national brothership denied his relationship with local povertys.
These are the states when Fed increases the rate rate
The growth of the sazeb will come and the market will be cut off, the debt costs will be stealed and the economy will be able to reach.
We know all of this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it will be.
For the economy, the history of a small origin of time is particularly offered.
Reese came after 11 months after the first increase of sazeb and was 86 months.
The agressive agressive of the federal reserve system in higher sazeb is often, although not always, determined in how economic and financial activity will be reacted.
That is why the officers of America's Central Banks have considered so strong that investors should not be measured on the beginning of the increase of sazeb, but often the traitor to keep normalization.
It's actually more variables in the game.
However, the members of the market may be able to ensure that all rules may be moved by the increase of speed.
"The primary increase of the FED since the global financial crisis will be uninterpreted in an interpretablely as the end of the 'legal money',' he reported in the notification for clients Julian Jessop, leadering the global economy Capital Economics.
Instead, we don't expect that the progressive return of American rate sazebs to more, but still low, create a seizm shock that many could be afraid.
It means that it's going to be inevitable effects.
This is the view of how some economic areas will respond, based on historical trends:
With regard to what the market recorded for the last centimeter of the month, the expected increase of the sazeb may make air a little instable.
Yet, as the increases, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"It seems that there are trends for re-starting actions after 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may be reversely in the mining policy," the Deutsche Bank analysis reported in the recent study about what happens after the Fed.
Recently, the market for the last 35 years of most often - at least 14 per cent - increases the sazeb in the average of 250 days (medium rate 2,6 per cent), and then returns back to the normal status of 500 days, with average value of the last six cycles 14,4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Boba Dolla, the main actoral rate of Nuveen Asset Management, from Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the action has the tendencies to stay more explicitly in the cycle of increased sazeb and the return begins to reduce.
Reese is actually economic life, but the increase of the satellite often helps her.
In the present time, Fed's part of some conditions not yet existing and which could be reviewed.
The most careful is that the severe home product near his lower point in the history when the Fedus sazes increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 increased sazeb since 1950 was only two times nominal interannual growth of HDP under 4,5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3,6 per cent, sometimes waiting for his maintenance when the third year was only 1,5 per cent of Atlanta Fed.
Increasing sazeb in this comprehensive economic background could be riskful and might be found a question, "When this time is different," said Deutsche.
The market participants were prepared for the growth of the Fedu all year and all eyes turned to meeting the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which was achieved this week and ended on Friday.
While many strategys and economics believe that the FOMC could apply the growth at this meeting, the future trade indicates only 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all higher cycles were then in a super cycle of increased pack effect with the HDP that covered the start of the review was very quickly starting return," wrote in the report.
However, this was only a lot of suffering from the worst research in the period of range of models.
The current cycle is the least far from when Fed waited from the end of the last review; record was 35 months, now we continue for 74 months and continue.
A certain expenditure was also volatile because the market expects to increase sazeb and the model is in some way similar to the action.
The main difference is that it is a rapid impact in the debts than in action when Fed changes the policy direction.
In the delegations, the expenditures appear to be amended immediately after the first accommodation cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increased rates of the delegations fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategy Charles Swaba believes that the increase of the sazeb makes the approach of the costs between long- and short-date debts, which is just a crowd.
The debates with high extent often work better in this climate, even though "We are still careful about the expenditure of the expenditure," introduced in his analysis Kathy Jones, extremely an analysis of a fixed expenditure in the Swab company.
It is interesting that Jones thinks that markets are already applied to waiting for the Fedu policy.
"Besides the forces of dollars and the plot of inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has applied to the most important change policy," wrote.
The short-coding rate stages are above, the rate cross is greater, the credit growth has increased and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed has increased the policy.
In general, the companies that carried out most of their business in the United States will win after the growth of rate samples and local products will be more attractive.
The national society will be a lot of debt, because the increased dollar will make their products better in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"The story shows that the "quality" action has to convince tendencies during three months after the initial increase of sazeb," the Goldman Sachsve analysis reported for the clients.
The companies with strong balances have been low-development companies in each increase of rate satellites in 1994, 1999, 2004 in average of 5 per cent points.
Companies with high expenditure from the capital, as well as with low volatility, have also fulfilled their low quality in average of 4 (procent point), respective 3 (percent).
It's gonna be a big problem.
Communities with a high-moving rate rate ranges will lose the most, says Goldman.
In addition to pure action games, the consumer also takes the use of growth dollars.
Friends can also see their tissues by higher costs, but the experts have different opinions on how long it will be.
BBC Radio 3 is a Classic FM copy of Andrew Bingham
The concert messenger Andrew Bingham criticized this station for the "happy"
It takes the view that it's more unknown than its commercial support.
He also built on the BBC Music Awards and says that it just brings the British.
Damien Collins' Command and says he's not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "change" in Classic FM, threatening forward messengers and smoothing the dark pressure to show that they do something that they do not do commercial sending.
The concert messenger Andrew Bingham also said to the boss BBC that the audience stations of public services seems to be "happy" and it's more unrecognisible than his business support.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I'm not recommended to use the word "involved" - but it seems to be changed to Classic FM," said.
It also was designed to the BBC Music Awards, starting in the long year.
BBC Music Awards, which started in the long-term year, seems to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that think of me when you really like what we have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC refused to reject that the BBC Radio 3 was far from his business support, if it is about living music and public education.
What I learned about classic music on the Council 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their obligation to live music and creating music is actually on the plot levels.
"I think the Radia 3's commitment to find new music and training in new business is also very important," says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radia 3 Alan Davey argumented that it is now necessary to work harder to introduce public than before, because the British's less education about classic music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that had been achieved under the ball because of the shipment of trade competitors during the mission of Culture, Media and Sport and the Commission.
Conservative messenger Damien Collins hit the Voice - a musical talent show that BBC buyed from the Netherlands producer Talpa Media for the price of $22 million.
Do you see why it discusses about this program as a non-original and something particularly different?
Lord Hall continued to show BBC1 - in which September of the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was made by "typical training for BBC".
He added that he wants to "the Corporation find a hit from his own stage" when he's going to start a funeral series.
However, he refused to exclude more future series of the Voice or to lose the money of the license holders in other forms of joy.
Internet sells a larger time from August and on wine can be Black Food
First three months in 2015, 7% increased online sales
The last month was signed by the less growth since the year 2000 started the same records
Internet sales were sent before three years by the mobile purchase
Experts believe that the Black Food could be caused to lose
More than decades was virtual buying on the river and thanks to him from many British main streets became a spirit cities.

Officers say that the entities of online sales are shown, and new data show 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth for the past years and go back to the year 2000, the state has always been rationalised," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG market index editor.
It explains that the Internet sells were sent before three years when the clients began to use their mobile phones to purchase.
It was meaning that people were able to buy online and they were able to realize buys in various contexts, for example, for consumption.
But now (creasing) is somewhere, and so it seems to be disagreed.
The Fenomen of the Black Five, which was played out of America, is cited as one of the causes of selling.
Officers believe that the advocats could keep the purchases before the event that ends the last fifth of November.
In the last year, five times more than the average of the purchasers turned back to their computer to purchase the purchases and then agreed with several web sites of vendors.
Officers believe that the Black Five, thanks to which they're buying again, can keep the customers from other purchases
The study published British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products, such as televisions and shoes, are more than the third of the sales carried out through web trades.
More than the fourth people buy clothes and bottles online, instead of buying in stone models.

Kingfisher announced the event as in the ship in half the year and sell after the group took the costs of the cluster of trade.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which own Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new businesses

In the problems with the heart, it is necessary to take care of the quantity of totally accepted tuck and calorie.
For example, in one sunny oil leather is 62 calorie, in the lens of the oil is 99 calories.

It is particularly important to obey 3 massage cylin.
The study of scientists published in the European Report of Clinical Resources showed that the day receivement of this substance is inadequate.
Mans in France and Greece consist of it to 0.6 games, even though Icelands accept 2.5 games.

According to the statistics, they are the most important nation of the American Grillotics.
On one house, there's 1,4 grils.
In the world, then, the various cohesions in the grilling, which only confirm the success of this kulinary disciple.
They're not in the back, nor the Chess.
On the basis of the consumer investigations of the Czech market, we are sure that 4% of people have not been raised in life.
Then most of them grills a few times for year.
To be successful, we don't have to appreciate the preparation - ideal is to edit the mass of marination for a few hours before the teeth editing.
What oil is the most efficient and likely to leave health useful substances?
In general, it would have been guarded at the same grilling process.
The experts agree that the large part of the oil is beginning in high temperatures to lose their weight.
Health extra panen oil, then, comes also on the body of the useful substance that we otherwise get in the consumption of oil from foods made at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra panen oils will not find their approval.
Great oil for grilling, health and beautiful.
When it says meat, the representatives of the Bohemia Olje of Kraslic in the Sokolovska will immediately save the horrible oil.
It's usually fulfills the weight of mass and fish.
In the kitchen, the only property of increased natural poverty of food is defined.
It is also appropriate to eliminate and grilling, because he has a high degree of smoking to 216 °C.
In this high temperature, however, as one of the small oil heavy health of useful substances, describes the costs of the worst oil Daniel Vleček from the Bohemia Olye company, which is a few Chinese producers of this oil from the net of sin.
Detectives agree that worse oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
In addition, it contains high quantity of lineal acids, and it is efficient to fight with the surrounding of cholesterol.
In the horror oil, our body also accepts an essential insected massiles, vitamines and minerals.

Therefore, when grilling, it is possible to use immediately two ways, to marination and self-free grilling.
We'll keep their happiness by marining meat and fish.
In the preparation of marinade, there must be three subfolders: oil, cycle and cycle.
For example, we add an eye of ice, and we do so much for meat.
The cocktail adds the meat and the oil conserves and adds the right ring, the Council of Daniel Vlчіk.
In addition, it adds that the horror oil is to marin right ideal because as one of the small oil can go through dark flesh.
So marined meat or fish are ready to grilling, how to continue?

According to the poor smoking and opening, you can also shoot the milk chills and the smoke.
For the end, catch a couple of horrible oil caps.
For the exception, then, you can solve a little smooth mandle.
Resolved sclerose: not only for drugs, but also for the will of the patient.
The discovered sclerose is complicated disease and a person with this diagnose needs a series of experts: neurologue, physiotherapeute, theteterapeuta, urology, oftal-mologue, psychological, psychiatra and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical treatment, for example, women with distracted sclerose needs and consultations if they are decided to have a child, as well as socially lawful advice, recommendations for the adoption of the adoption of the residence of the aphod.
However, this is not enough: the development of the disease can be based on the effect of the patient itself.
How much more it will be to fight with the disease actively, so long it can work and doesn't need to change the style of his life.
As the doctors thus advertised, the passivity allows the disease active space.
It is, for example, indicated that the regular moves significantly decline the time when a sick needs a compensive assistance, for example, the heat.
It is important that patients and their circumstances do not belong to various cycles, for example that the disease is automatically carried out to end on the car.
And therefore, Daj took a chance (www.bezmyt.cz), which is supporting the media campaign Daj's chance.
The most important person in the case of a disease with disgusted sclerose is neurolog.
Duely, in the diseased sclerose, the doctor may have affected what the disease begins to be treated before.
It's because we have the medicine on the disrupted sclerose in a striking stage when there's no neurodgeneration process so strong.
What we have before, more hope is that we can stop and depart from invalidization, explains MUD. Eva Meda from Neurological Clinic Universal Faculty hospital in Praia.
It is very important for people with a disrupted sclerose rehabilitation treatment, which is most often resolving low ends or equation of equation.
With hospitals, it works according to their individual needs: to maintain the rate, improvement, strengthenment of the master day, reduction of the pool or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, a matter of specific difficulties of patients," says MUD Martin Kuwari, the Clinics Prime Minister of Rehabilitation and Body Medicine Faculty in Motole.
People with the sclerose, even even the same disease, but in each other, are a little different way.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always decrease its signs.
However, the movement activities also strengthens the immunity status of the body, which is in the case of disrupted scleroses required.
The next positive regulation is the fact that the sick are sure that they can control everything, and that strengthens their self-existence.
"The endorphys are also exposed and a person feels good after it," advertises PhDr. Camila Rosa from the Clinic Rehabilitation Medicine of the Faculty Disease of the King Vinohrady.
As we influence the physical side, we will apply to the limbical system responsible for emotion.
We also include psychic and immune processes and stabilizing the disease, adds.
"Before these patients have so watched, we know today that they need a target rate," says Dr. Paed Dr. Paul Kolar, the clinical clinics of rehabilitation and body medicine in Motole.
The purpose of physiotherapy is that a person can stay a part of a self-department, including a worker order.
Phyzotherapites therefore cooperate with the technology that each person gets compensive assistance to him in peace.
Many patients need psychological or psychiatric treatment.
They're in hard life situation.
When you come to a serious disease, most people will worry about it.
They're a shock, a panic, a fear.
He needs to react to a great challenge - Health loss.
With such a disgusting soul, we have to follow somebody, do not try to disagree everything on your own dreams.
"I'm talking to them so that they finally get to conclude that it can also live a complete life and that the desolated sclerose is not the end of life," says the psychoterapeut Renata Malin's - Schubert from Neurological Clinics Global Faculty hospital in Praia.
Without the latecore manufacturer, the airbuses would not fly.
Aeroplane production is synonymous and advanced technologies.
New aircrafts are full of titan or easy and fixed composite materials that are not able to produce and process.
However, with super-profit, computers conducted machines, with auto-keys to explore compositions to drag something as usual as merunic pecks.
In the bubn, which reminds the hrn on the sugar vacuum, in the top of the pig are lost the games of ball parts that have just been out of the freshealing machine.
"Therefore no one has come to anything better," Ivan Dubski, general director of the Latecore Republic of the Airport.
In the area in the fields of the Flying League, the first League's full door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world add the door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, which are set up in Praia, also enter the traveling to the first and higher classes on the mountains of the largest transport airport airport world of Airbus A380.
They're moving here and the door of full compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
It's the main motive here.
It's probably a moment key that allows the company to order two times for year.
If it would be wrong with the control record, they should explain the auditors of Airbus or Boeing, which lead to regularly check whether the door is produced in accordance with the agreed rules.
People's minds, but the advanced technology has not been completely replaced.
On one doors to A320, there's 1500 nits.
You have to shoot the nitlers handmaid.
It's two days for them.
And, according to the sound of the surprise, they know if it's not exactly broken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimum.
The aircraft can go out from zero to 0.13 milimeters over the plane.
It's a double-shirt of human hair.
When checking, it's coming to a series of exchanges.
When the controller's gone a stick after a number of others, he knows if it's somebody outside tolerant.
Then we'll take a complete smoke in the hand.
Letov lived before 1989, the Military Military Aeroplane L-39.
Only in 1991, he wasn't born any more.
The company had to find new laws quickly.
Then she agreed with the European Airbus airport producer.
She played the choice management on the additives for the A321 model.
The conversation with Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were a small company that had not enough money for investment and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stabil advantages," remembers Dubski.
The doors to the American manufacturers would be encouraging if Lev had not committed to the Prash Conference of the International Aviation Industrial Group of Latecore in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day, she's been working with France, named Dubski.
A year later, Latecore was buying the Chess company and with a strong company came new charges.
Immediately, in 2000, the montage of the door parts for A320 was developed.
Three years later, the top doors came to A380.
In 2006, the company established a new challenge for the processing of composite for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecore, we wouldn't get ourselves to these great laws.
Maybe we would do parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubski.
Loni Czech Latecore has reached more than 2,9 billion and ice after 147 million corners.
Excluding position between additives of aircraft products is not increasing.
The latecore in Praia from 2000 invested 1,5 billion corn.
The company must have quality certificates, certificate 170 of special manufacturer processes and tests for key employment.
Without them, there would not be any doors to the airport.
Receiving certificates that the manufacturers are responsible for the requirements of the customers, and in the retracted checks, they are maintained in accordance with the Mill.
The manufacturing processes change each year.
They're more precious and more nice.
We need to train employment, review the device and re-certificate the entire process, adds Dubski.
The company now finishs the preparation of the process to monitor the cycle and the cycle, which replaces adequate for human health chadmium.
The instructions were therefore obtained from the manufacturer, but the technologies had to apply for equipment or chemicals used in Praia.
The people from Boeing are coming, believe the concept of all lines.
Then we'll bring them the production.
They also control our lab.
One saddle of models test themselves in their laboratory and then the results compare to ours, approachs Dub's way to control them.
The rewards are the long-term exclusive contracts of the forest company.
Today, with fresh weight, the production of emergency is falling.
For A320, A320 produces half of the gate.
Replace the Chess Latecore is impossible for the Brazilian or European manufacturer or very compatible.
However, it doesn't mean that he could say any price for the door.
The part of the contract is the price crowd.
This shows how many doors will be stayed after ten, fifty, stealed steen.
The price for the cost is still driving to a certain limit value.
We have to go into this price template.
If not, we're going to work, he says Dubski.
Half of the balls, where the electronic box is completed for military airport Airbus A400 M, is still empty.
But it's a symbol of future.
In the field, there is a new polyrobotic line for mounting and mounting doors for invested model A320 Neo.
It's quickly quick.
"It's a trend who's mounting in the aircraft," adds Dubski.
It's safe for the future line.
Airbus reports that the aircraft companys have still met 3278 pieces of the new A320 model.
Only about a few meters nearby, a row for the full mounting door for the top A380.
It's a strategic decision of our mother's company.
The goal is to reduce the production period and reduce costs.
The full mounting could start for two years, says Dubski.
However, the company has to carry out qualitative tests needed to mount some electric and electronic devices to the door for the largest Airbus.
The company includes further development of products from composite materials.
Except Boeing should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will competite with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company, it's a serious credit when he can be able to process and composite except for cow materials," says Dubski.
However, latecore is reached to the border of production capacity in the Czech.
In Leov's Area where he sits, there's no more place.
Before the introduction of the French mother was a company of 180 employees.
Now they're 800 and three years could be more than one hundred.
While Airbus and Boeing are prevented, how many hundreds of new airlines have been joined each year, they don't have fear of work.
Although he has a few years ago, the maternity company of the Latecore's weakness of the bankrot.
The French group did not have enough money for the guards.
Finally, Latecore could agree with the main trusters.
At the end of the August, the part of the ship was changed by action.
57.4 million euros in the capital increased in the company of 57.4 per cent.
The lead of the company was cut about two thirds, so about 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial health has come to the beginning of September.
The society has increased between the remaining actors of new actions for 222,9 million euros.
It's totally taking the basic capital of 280 million euros.
However, the whole group is 85 per cent of the growth of airbus and Boeing products.
The average growth of the law is expected for four percent to year to 2017.
In the law books, there are $2,6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
The French media says that Latecore is finally able to explore again after years.
The Czech Refugees in the Puerto River is significant for groups.
The group's market has 16 percent.
According to the number of employees, the largest frontier group.
The messengers supported the greater part of the State from the pockets of the carbon.
The changes in non-creasing levels shall be brought to the State bank over 427 million corners in 2013.
In the achievement of the budgets of the aliens, it has a negative impact in the government because the payment must be higher.
In the past year, there were 450 million corners and 150 million corners.
From the difficulty of the cold carbon was about 200 million corners and 66 million corners.
The New Computes and increases the frontiers of the home space with a hard difficulty for thousand corners per year.
The Annex from this office is still in full field to be foreign.
The Ministry of the Industrie of Jan Mladek (CHSSD) said to the messengers that the others have been achieved in place of 14 million to 100 million corners in the year.
The higher difficult funds will not be determined by the law, but the Government shall establish it by its Regulation.
The reputation shall be calculated as a consisting of a number of disagreements and assets for individual kinds of disease.
According to the Government, there is a reason for changing the possibility of urgent reaction on the current economic situation.
The OS Marek Benda messenger warned that the regulation of the Government should not be complied with the approval.
However, according to the Ministry of Justice, it is not in this case because the State pays the weakness that is the State's owner.
The grounds reach only foreign, where the fields are difficult.
In the case of deep diseases, three fourth money will be obtained foreign and fourth state.
The same amount will also be in the case of the difficulty of radioactive horns.
The part of the money that is stated on the grounds of difficulties will be able to take place.
For example, 28 per cent will have to be carried out by hardship or to ensure the safeguard services.
The proposal was criticised today by opposition messengers who declared, in particular, that the aliens are in danger of the difficulties and countries.
For example, Michal Kučara (TOP 09 and Starost) warned that hard companies will not want to monitor the aliens as well as still, because they will pay higher payments directly to the State budget.
"It is not possible to tunel one of the most highest regions only to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Usvit) chosen in the East country.
Before the growth of unemployment on the Moscow, KSCHM Hana Aulick was warned.
Kadner and Aulick proposed unfortunately to reject the news, Kučara wanted to return the government to work.
In the ground report, the increase of charges is not allowed to carry prices because the prices are more than 90 percent of long-term.
The main consumers as electric or temperature should therefore not feel price growth.
"In the other hand, this fact increases the risk that difficult organizations will compense the office to compense the efforts to reduce their employment costs, which would be particularly significant to reduce the number of employees," the Government applies.
However, there is an increase in the employment employment.
According to the reports of Milan Urban (CHSSD), the messengers are key to recognize the conclusions on the updated energy concept and mainly the decision of the Government on the limits of illness.
If it's a threat to do so for limits, then it's gonna have an impact on the costs for State and foreign, he's raised up.
Urban does not agree to the young man in that the decision on the limit of the Czech Slovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the CSA should have already been proceeded for the causes of social, national economy and for the reason of long-term stability of tumor energy.
Time for the decision on rate samples for the American Federal Reserve
The whole world sees how the American Federal Reserve is able to get two days in the middle and quarter to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase the levels first after the decade.
The investigation of 80 economies of the Reuters' reuters discovered that more than half of those who thought that Federal Reserve will make a decision now think that they remain inactive for a while and leave the rate of 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historical event because it's been seen for years from the moment when Fed was reduced to zero.
First, we are close to the situation when the main central bank could be able to get out of the NULL ship and start the normalization process of rate sazeb," angel Ubide, leader of Peterson's Institute for International Economic.
America's economy was achieved directly well, in the form of adding trillion dollars to the State account and creating only a lower level of inflation.
However, Fed can't ignore the less red global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for increase, but the circumstances prove that they also see great chances against this step.
Decision shall be announced at September 20:00 SECH.
The Shooter at the State University of Delta left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shoot his friend in Mississippi on the Sunday, and later on the day and his colleague, wrote a message in which he says that he's the first murderer, and that he's able to take it back to the outer government office.
The police in Gautier in Mississippi stated that Lamb, a master of lands and social sciences at the State University of Delta, called the police on the morning about ten hours
And he said he shot somebody.
The Lamb's disaster asked him to send a cop to his house.
He said, “I shoot my wife yesterday,” and also mentioned that in the house there's a "great dog," who's not going to steal anybody, but it's disappointed.
The police requested the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't predict.
The Lamb did not explain why he shot in the house.
When the police arrived in the place, she found the body of Amy Prentis’ 41 - year - old body and manually written from Lamba: “I am so sorry and I'm sure I can take it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After leaveing the report, Lamb delivered a long way to the Delta University, where the teacher of the history of Ethan Schmidt killed and then took his own life.
Thanks to the University William LaForge said that he didn't know any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but that “and Mr. Lamba's head was obviously offered something.”
In addition to the Monday statement that Lamb believed in the romantic relationship with Amy Prentis with Schmidt's Government authorities, there were no evidence about the “from the triangle”.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married with Princess' wife over seven years, showed that it was "beautiful."
There were 15 years ago, but both friends remained.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentis was all the case "deterred".
O'Steen said that Prentis and her daughter were "the best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a neighborhood of Princess, just as he led Sun Herald, the Prentis worked out of the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a famous dog named Blesk, went with Lambe about three years.
“ She always wanted to help others, ” she left Knowles.
The police stated that Lamb talked to his relatives on the Sunday and said that he would not go to prison.
When the police's got him to the town near Greenville later evening, Lamb stopped and fled into the forest where he was shooting.
According to the Life Book published on school pages, Lamb received a doctor in the Education Accommodation at Delta University on January 2015.
The stars that lost their cow
Herec (left), on the picture of his son Redmond (right), has a few stressed years.
In 2001 he was fighting with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his long-year partner Farrah Fawcett because of the race.
Therec also had a significant problem with drugs and in 2008 was arrested for drugs.
All these things will certainly choose their gifts.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game due to the double smoking.
Luke Shaw suffered twice the right feet of the right feet during the assault of Manchester United in the Lize of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left smoking was left in the shoes and raised it from games at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the session.
The condemnation made an incompatible procedure to Hector Moren in 15 minutes when the 20-year-old Shaw was sold to the PSV space.
Nine minutes were watched at the pit and was also needed a cyclical mask before he was carried into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a twice feet and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow, and then it will be operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who's coming to Manchester in 18 years is very hard, but he's playing fantastically and then it's gonna happen.
When he was in the shadows, he also had a cyclical mask.
Placal.
I'm not a doctor, but two-foot-shirts are required for six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe this session is still winning.
Moreno had great luck that he didn't get a red card and a penal hair.
The Nicola Rizzoli Mexican decided not.
Van Gall stated that the Italian decision had been deceived.
You can judge yourself if the penalty and the red card has been done.
It was a very smoking step with both foots.
Twiet from Shawa account says, "Thank you all for their reports, the words can't be expressed how I'm destroyed, my path to return is now beginning and I'll be stronger."
Communication: Manchaster United announced Luke Shawa in PSV
The English conversion will be added to the motivation to repeat in the form of mystery of Europe in France in the next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV trainer, said, "It's been a very exciting pain."
When any player goes out of sin with such a pain, everyone is very suffering.
It's never the goal of our players to struggle the player.
Moreno suffered the slogan of the feet in the story of Mexico against Van Gaal Holland on the world's mystery in 2014.
"It's very hard for him, because his intention was not to hurt the player, and when you hear the difficulty of such a threat, it's not good," said Coc.
I wasn't able to explore this moment.
I just saw a smoke that directed another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched him, but I didn't see Luke's tracking.
In SBS6 talk, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel bad about that, I'm so sorry.
PSV Andrésguardo was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling.
David Cameron really knows the Lorax better?
This thing knows every parents: when the child loves the book, it's not long before he learns it almost remembering it.
You don't have to be David Cameron.
On the question of the providers of children schemes to be called a favorite child book, he chose the President of the Government of Lorax, a bath of Dr. Seuss from 1971.
It was hard to choose, write Cameron in the report published on the SuperCamps web site and continued: "Work, creative, and strong content, so I liked to read my children, because it was always an image or a message that I have never seen before."
Okay, since Cameron, next paragraph, described the books according to the exhibition of a film from 2012, which added further positions and details to fill the struck original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature has stopped existing, and even the air is a cocody, the boy name Ted hopes that the heart of the girls of his dreams, Audrey, so that she fills her love to see real tree," is a struck book that records the object of love of the unknown Dr Seuss, who was the true name Theodor Seuss Geisel died in 1991.
Jacob was not so surprised, the text added to Cameron read as a similar expression of the Lorax film, which is located on the Internet Movie Database, and begins words: "In the city of Tenneed-Ville, where all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-re, the boy name Ted hopes that the heart of the girls, Audrey."
Because he was openly practical parents, it seems impossible that Cameron would not know about the book, where the unnamed young man knows that the local nature destroys horrible, trees that carried out once-lears, which also through the protest of the title Lorax, who is able to speak for the trees.
With the most probable probable PR has received a helper who has never read Lorax's child 20 times in the kids.
The Downing Street showed that the text was almost coming from Camerona's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text gave Camerona employer, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in a threat of Anglia, but still worried.
Compatibility with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a hard task, but after looking on the team that Anglia has chosen on this turn, I'm going to repeat the threat 3-0 that has suffered recently in the experiment series, it's not likely.
I wouldn't even fix the hosts' expenditure.
The Alastaira Cooka page can be less experienced than these three years ago, but there is a good player in this packaging meeting and also collective thoughts are strong; they are not attached from 2012, but only a young position.
With the sword Moeen Ali is developing spinners and Adil Rashid, even though it is unknown at the level of test series, represents an avoidable opportunity.
Further: Adam Lyth went out of the team of England in a series experiment and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to forget Adam Lytha is a serious tracking for me, because his main trainer is in Yorkshir.
His seven tests remained against two good attacks in ancient conditions and simply, but the reality is that they are a critical player based on the execution.
For example, about the name of Joe Root, there were no questioners that led to announce, because — and I have already seen this — the players are their best electors.
A few more half-seconds and Lyth could spend his series, but he had control over his own consciousness.
Let's hope that when he's able to get more moves for Yorkshire, he's shown another opportunity.
The head trainer of Anglia, Trevor Bayliss, glorifyed his positions, even though his executions were not completely gradual, and it doesn't surprise me; it was always a team player.
The question of how many test times will be gained to show it is a serious steel.
Lyth got seven chappies — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance to go home and outside.
The only thing that you could cut it is that Anglia had given the chance to Jonathan Trotto in Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this worried opportunity is already old.
Alex Hales is coming, and this is the warner that I value very precisely.
It's a x-factor player that we saw here in Yorkshira at the beginning of the meeting when he got 236 against us on the throat of Trent Bridge, which did so much.
It must be given to him at least the same opportunity that he had obtained by his previous leader, but, of course, this will be involved on the total meeting in the United Arab Emirates.
The thought when Moeen begins on the side of Cooka, which would get another extra spider while he'd keep four quicks, was taken up and I have no expenditure against it.
I don't understand why strokemaker can't burn, and this leavorable man has already shown that he's a wonderful cricket player.
Maybe Moeen couldn't do his work for his country, Worcestershire, but he was for them number 3 and a big difference in it is not.
My old team colleague Justin Langer played the first 38 trials before his exposure in 2001.
He was immediately tre hundreds and he didn't look at him.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a basic spinner, and when I had a chance to watch him, he took me as a very popular young man.
People can look at his grave statistics — average 31 with battle and 35 with sword — and I see it as a plot, but not a lot of spiders that would take their hands, and the electors decided for young people.
It's a lot of learning about this tour.
Both the team seems that Anglie has done several changes and smart complements of their trainer personal.
The name of Mahel Jayawardenea, a fighter from Sri Lanky, as a consulant for experimental cases can be a mysterious tattoo.
He's one of the best playing guys who bring rich experiences to have experiences with all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the white-ball round part and brings it to the team as an energy, so that it's not likely.
I always felt that he was just born in the world of international crickets, to be as a player or trainer, and as Mahel has a intelligence that can use.
New voices in the shadow, even though they are the voices that say the consistent things that were already spoken before, they may sometimes remove and light the atmosphere.
Colly Durhama Ben Stokes has received a single freedom, as Root has received a similar interruption against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many of them are inadequate, trainers and electorers do not make harmonograms.
And you have to remember as a player that their job is interesting on the results.
This decision can never be able to make it easy.
Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to 2017.
The unexpected strategy of David Camerona to maintain the United Kingdom is achieved to other problems with each applied day and without choice of the Genelic Jeremy "Is it or not?" Corbyn to the Department Party, or TUC will be able to take the entire situation around Europe.
The strangers also have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomats recently explained how Europe was attached to various crisis - of which they are not all their sins - some Member States have already enough British electronic agencies, consensus and rural changes of the Treaty that most of them wanted.
At their yearly meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they wouldn't even want to have a social protection.
We can even call it the same agenda Dave and George.
Premier and officer walk on summits or two-shirt meetings in the front of the metropolis, make a photo before the honourable local monument, with or without local valuators, and then return homes to the word that they play the relationship for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants to be disappointed by the United Kingdom in Europe - "Don't let us go with France," says Berlin - indicates that some of the short-speed Ministers and officers in some major cities have been achieved in the point when our department does not depend on them.
Angela Merkel, German officer, is a partner, but he was in the power of 10 years and wanted to leave his post before it becomes bad as it was for too long to continue Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
Francouz François Hollande re-replacement or replacement in 2017.
His power also bears.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how the feet are lame by helping Selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to save Skots in the United States - which is something they don't want because they have similar separat tendency.
So some of these ministers can plan extremely unnecessary notes of the SNP style during the campaign before referencing 2017 in the Great Britain to achieve the Brexit process, a friend.
"Returnation has resolved a problem" and "Britance has nothing worth of exhibition."
Europeans to their own renew know how dream Fleet Street can be and how the EU's boxes are pressing oilgarch barneys, because they were not in the reference of the inspired Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our income in 1973 in accordance with 2:1.
They may remember the name of Boris Johnson, a great Euro-opportunity who made his name like Brussels reporting "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the ninety-year years.
Besides his desire, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
The currency of donations of non- paid donors, foreign phones and pseudo non-marine departments, which have owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing, but he knew that when you were in the clothes with a lot of gurilla, you have to get her home of bans to not get you to the dinner and then to the tea too.
In fact, Miliband was more than Blair than the only Blair, when he refused Camerono’s reference rutin since Blair allowed the principle of the unresolved EU constitution, which was attached to French and Netherlands choices in 2005 and received a map of exhibition.
I've never been in charge of that.
But sweet Jeremy Corbyn, who took me on the Sunday in Westminster's friends, I told him that I couldn't lose time - it seems to be in danger of recovering the Murdoch Neila Kinocka strategy, which was probably now.
It may have a time to continue, but it needs to make a coherent strategy for medium advancement, not with me, but, of course, with Andrew Marrem, who was crucified at the BBC on week.
Corbin's official positions against Europe, I'll tell it, they're exhausted.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people are outside the Ukip's range and the amazing borders of Tory's little Englands may certainly be able to achieve it.
The same Hilary said "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn in the radio and TV this week when his internal shift couldn't decide to allow Corby's name of abstract McDonnella as a officer.
It reminded me of 70 years when his old father was fighting in the television about his loyalty and didn't go too far and lost his job.
Hilary was a lot more attractive.
But fighting for us to stay "for all circumstances" - Bennina phrase - according to all that McDonnell said, and not what JC said to the colleagues and messengers on their private meeting on the evening,
Let there be any background, a civil image that wants to share Corbyn - don't forget me - the disciple reports remains important in the world-day television transport and, especially in faith, the paranoia and the advice that are social media
It is not sufficient to provide Cameron's free entrance to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Delegated Parties in the reference campaigns, as McDonnell.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, McDonnellov and Corbyno's basic deployment on the EU membership - in accordance with their Bennite economic, anti-capitalistic age - is not only a question of istheric discussion between the left disidents, which is the narcism of small central differences of dogmatical disabilities.
Like his exclamation about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign does not want to finish - frontal diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of everything for their household.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose the political capital - they also have a surprised volunteers - because of the conscience of the British when it seems to be enough?
The United States are already exclaimed from the British "leading military execution in Iraq, Libya and Siria, and also in reducing the costs of concert governments in power, as I was reminded of the Sunday start of something that was called the Security Forum of British influence.
Experts criticize the reviews of the electronic published agent of Public Health England
The declaration of the Government financed Agency on which the electronic cigarettes are more safe than the purchase, has come from the meeting of 12 people with which some have linked to the tabaco industry, they are investigators.
The writers in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) were connected to the Lancet crisis of evidence used in their report on the electronic cigarettes of the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE Agency published the "middle" report last month and described it as "complex review of evidence".
However, several researchers have discovered data contents and advertising the requirements between certain experts and the tax industry.
The Leader in a good magazine Lancet in the past month in the "marriedly chatrical basis", on which the PHE Agency founded his main conclusions.
Two other writers write for BMJ have found the statement that was fully "posed on a rock or a single."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health on London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a clinical epidemiology professor at the University of Liverpool, said, "The basic principle of public health is that the policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They show that publicity could expect that the PHE Agency's statement, which means "the best deal is that e-cigarets are about 95% less worse than suffering" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people invited to develop multi-criteria decisions (MCDA) model to syntheise their opinions on accidents associated with various products containing nikotin; the results of the process were raised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell indicate that one sponsor of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, who has received financial media from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also approved the public health of BAT in the report of maintenance.
One of 12 participants of the meeting agreed to finance from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the financing that he received from the tabak company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the election of members of the panel is not available, but there contains several knowledge of electronic cigarettes, some of which also include industrial financing.
Some other present meetings are not known for their famous knowledge in battle against suffering.
The meeting in the PHE was also participated in tabaking guidelines.
The report is referred to in this group "wheelfully support", which has missed "great evidence of devotion of most products on most criteria," wrote McKeee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PH's statement that "Therefore there is no evidence that the e-cigarettes would make as a path to purchase for children or injuries," was before.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and welcome in PHE, stated that BMJ was already responsible.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are usually less worse than cooking."
One of the two stewards will die because of its consciousness.
All evidence indicates that health risks presented by electronic cigarettes are small, but we must continue to examine long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence show, and also what they do not show, especially when there was so many public ranks on relative dangers in comparison with the tabac.
At least 80,000 people will die a year in the disease related to the purchase and purchase of NHS are £2 billion each year.
The clearness of the present evidence - that even if the e-cigaretes are not without risk, they are not only disagreements made by suffering - we fill our national competences.
BBC should be finished with EastEnders, the former Director Channel 4
The Chairman Channel 4, Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his trade rivals would "the right hand" for the hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the licence payment should be used only for programs that are not created by other British television.
The BBC crisised that it has established public services programs that will probably be monitored only the shipment of people, in the combined intervals of sending to its rivals "the largest rating show, and on the channels as BBC4.
After generally the director Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unfortunately trying to connect with the BBC all six years that worked on Channel 4.
"I am afraid of the thought that the BBC provides and sends programmes that would certainly be sent to ships without State's contributions," said Johnson in the Commission for communication in the High High Smart, as part of action on the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license plans that I am not sure if they are in the middle or long-term front of good, it should reduce the creation at least something about other programs that do not work or do not pay.
They send The Voice in the main sending time, because they want to get the most largest possible support to the future.
The thought that nobody else would send him, it's a funny funny, and it's unbelievable.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why the regressive payment should support the programmes that can be financed in an uncommon.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and understandingly produced at home.
In fact, other channels would give their right hand quietly.
I can't understand how these public mail services are.
I don't think it's even in the late BBC.
Johnson, a serial officer who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC feels guilty because he got the ratings "for the emotion of people who worked here, and because he believed that it's the best way to ensure long support."
His comment on the most popular shows of BBC repeats those who were the old executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that BBC sell show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the most heavy public services programmes of BBC "come to BBC4, where it is often not possible to measure the obsession, but they are fulfilled by their authority and may argument when they are able to justify £4bn from the license, "But, we do all these insurance programs that do not look at anyone."
They're sending them in time when nobody looks at them.
What's about the license plan, Johnson said to the Commission, "I'm calling you to find a regressive system on the one who will get the best value.
Of course, we all think that 150 British books are a large sum of year, but for people for which 150 liters are much, I would wonder if they were so paying, because they don't look so much on BBC.
He was director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who went out before the Commission, said that BBC should revise his reat mission in the meaning "inform, education and bath."
He confirmed that the small BBC products were already classified as educators - it was 1% TV products and 0.1% in the radio - and should be taken as a model of public posting in Australia and Canada and to change to "inform, public and discreet."
On the subject of the partnership Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were in the television, was only rolled up, and related to trade reporters, so we can all see them online.
‘Songenetics’ or control of brain cells using sound lens
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that they move to depth.
The scientists gathered the red with genetically modified nerve system that can control sound lens.
The detailed vision changes the direction at the moment when sound impressions are invisible for human ear.
Puzzle works so that the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultra sound balls.
Consistent: Scientifics can read and write the brain activity through light
The scientists have noted that these reds are a great new methodology called soundgenetics, which uses ultrason to activate brain, heart and sval cells and activates beside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, introduced for the journal Guardian that this method could be replaced by a deep brain stimulation - an invasion procedure in which patients are carried out electricities that stimulate the brain. The method is used for the treatment of Parkinson disease.
The audiences usually do not respond to the ultra sound, but Chalasani found that reactions will be achieved when they are located to the technology containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles strengthen ultra-such-shirts that then walks with the Red body.
The green ultrason balls are struggle in the TRP-4 channels, which are in the memories of some red cells.
Thanks to sound balls, these channels open and activate cells with which are connected will be reported in the magazine Nature Communications.
In order to control the vision through ultra sounds, Chalasani genetically changed the red so that some of their motor neurons contain the ion TRP-4 channels.
Then, when he used this modified black ultrason, the sound branches were broken by microbublins and were moved to the red where the modified motor neurony were enabled.
The new method is like a multiple optogenetic, a pioneer tool that allows scientists to cut and hide neurons through light.
Chalasani left to hear that soundgenetics could have a lot of exhibition to this technology.
On the difference of the light that must be sent by the optical thread to the place required in the brain, ultra-suching balls can be cut off without limitation and to be sent directly into the brain.
“We believe that when we use the genetic treatment and therapeutic virus, we can obey human neurons and make them temporarily significantly in ultrason signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological disease, ” said Chalasani.
It added that its application method would also find in the treatment of sval cells and cells that produce insulins.
Negative municipal device - directly on your bowl!
Inzerates with guns in the British trade.
See the video on the contrary market from Amnesty International.
The horrible killers of the drone!
Cooks on the feet that shoot the kitchens!
Three shots!
And electronic mixing smokes that make insensible pain, but they do not leave any steps!
The joyful voice and caricature of metafor is not allowing no one to doubt that this record on the largest world branches of weapons is an open parody created for Amnesty International because of the extent of the British governments to sell repressive systems through protection and security devices in ExCeL Centre in the London quarter Docklands.
Relative: DSEI weapons: Authorizations are meetings to London
However, the other campaign is also led to the packing of plaquets on bus stages and metros required by second view.
"The important notification, DLL Accession from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using the letters with the label of the London Meter with the DLL links is the image of the tank.
Years in September will be the day of businessers with weapons meeting on DLR ... the customers are required to help stop the trade with weapons.
At 300 plaquets, the artists are created that built their work in Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective name of the Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute all London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 for the Allen key, which gives the "required access to the third reklame of the autobus staff on the planet".
Transport for London is not packed with this flight "vandalism".
One of the reklame parodies produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavina Grindona, Cruel Designs and a good assistant at the University of Essex, the artists are still more surprising and try to show political activities to the divines outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activity in the framework of protest shifts and know that they need to get out in the real world to have their knowledge of impact on the company.
Next of the plots against trade with weapons of health in metro.
Video Amnesty was looking at Facebook over 1000,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP Agency who worked without prejudice for the honour and graphical designer and the commenter also worked hardly.
The Creative Director VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent locking records of trade with weapons - he saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let us show them the campaign that is trying to go out."
They played with the creation of the most realistic risk-profits, but, "Going to pester colors and animations, I've achieved that it's more people. "
"They took a wonderful job, and helped us to build fears about the sale of non-legalistic municipalities of robbery instruments," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is to take the Government of the United Kingdom and ensure that it is not illegal to act in our ship with the municipal device.
Moreover, the most creative training with weapons comes outside ExCeL, where the manufacturers sell fantasticly efficient products.
In the print report, Saab rejected the United States Army to "to the AT4CS RS RS".
This includes "uniquely threatened head that provides wonderful effects beside the burning within the target."
If that's whatever it's, it's not nice.
Eight gold rules for life on students
11 years ago, I moved to student roads as an unbelievable ninety-year-year-old boy, still believed in colors and moral relationships, but now I will save the writers of those who I did - and reading, long-term stress on the other.
All I learned can be destituted in eight simple rules.
Drawing on the road can be moved from a lot to the nerve that goes up to completely worried.
It's lovely crazy to say to people from where you are, if you have taken a year of break, which you're looking at Corbyn and why "You don't really love and don't know Marmite, because people, it's just an expression from HAHAH, I'll be at myself in peace."
Shut up.
And help others to get up - ask yourself and show interest.
It's the conversion, and it's gonna help you find people you like, and you who wouldn't have been with you even if your rows were in one fire and they would give the struggles.
Let people go to space.
People's rooms are often changed to drink receipts, locations of films and community public places, but they are also rooms in which people dress and edit the bottom.
Consistent: Don't think that you should go up to high and then be in relationship
Introvers will come shortly.
Your room should be a refuge, although a lot of changes on a foreign traveling culture that is friendly, social and contributes to the comprehensive friendship.
It may be hell for someone who needs to buy it.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want to continue our friendship, but I need you to go back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a society is humbled from socialization - and you may write to him a place of injury.
When it's already a word about the shopping, kiss it.
One boy in my rooms was normal that if the door is not locked, he's invited inside.
He saw a few things.
Take your friends thanks for the shipment.
Because you started walking to the university on the top of the pitch, rolling on the outside door and presentation with the floor of the pitched balls seems unlikely weird, less than "Go to the neighborhood, something I'm threatened you, now, while I'm going to ask personal questions."
The offering of households is a good way to find friends.
Your colleagues will feel the need to talk to you, and maybe everything will end so that your face will make up to a poor surprise.
Of course, that's the subject that you're a decent pick-up.
The bad condensed cups, sugar and smoke will probably interrupt that the others will have a dream when you are trying to shoot them on the door.
The eating is on students in a regular crime.
Of course, you're worthy of all the cocktail, but is the cup of a milk in your tea?
Twice, check it with the master of the milk.
There's a chance that a milk will offer you even when they're inside.
If someone steals you something, it's amazing, and you have my symptoms - but try to get a bit more adulter than my partner who has changed his milk for the mixture of the woods, so that it's a mistake.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't do sounds that move people from sleep or study.
It's not just to be a decent human residence, but you are also published in the steady houses.
The girl from my journey asked her neighbors if they could quiet a little drum and bass because they were 3 night and morning had a letter.
Their response was sending music.
When they finally escaped in 5 hours morning, she left them to sleep silently two hours and then left the voice of his own music, locked the door and went to her three - hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future would walk on the same round as you?
And yet, wouldn't it be extremely comfortable if you had joined partners for your future desires, to sleep together, to walk and to see each day, and might also have overcome control over your joint friends?
Of course, you don't disturb your heart, but if your sex partners are not a percentage of your future, try at least a little to talk to your slides.
In the particular time you know that someone left the key in his unlocked room, it's only the limit between playing and skin.
That's a good shot, but it's easy.
Learn them precious and nice lessons about their safeguarding that you hide them - never read a room of dress and shopping.
Close them the door and give them the keys to the ball with the water that you shoot in the darkness - but never get their things on the street more than twice.
Eva was happy for two girls and over the most recent views of the future.
Eva lived a painful moment when he was able to have a seven-year-old blessing today.
His dad was separated with her, and she was alone for the preparation and exhaustion.
With the situation, I was just quickly equipped -- I was very happy for the child, and I was looking for the position.
I'm not here and I'm with a child alone, I'm trying to do it.
And I certainly had hope in myself that we're not staying for a long time, she remembers Eva for her first distress today.
She's already met on the Internet on the chat of the old Vashka chat that they started talking about the favorite films.
Your Eva with the Benefit even brought home from the birthday, but the role of the unfair father was not too struck.
"In some time it was downloaded from the program," wrote Eva in the documentary Serial Four in the 3.
The third series of the Chess series is just looking for happiness for the second trial.
Works about the Vitca and the Financial Security of the families have managed to work on a party commitment and great assistance to the mothers and the teenagers.
Neither looking for the responsibility for a stranger child, at the end of your integrity to Eve.
It was definitively joined around the Vitk's second birth, and this is now the understanding of Vashka as his father, and it also delights him.
Although the Vashek has two adult daughters, the fathers in 60 are used according to their words and the children are also more winning.
Besides the Benedict came to them two years old Leontin and finally a two-year-old girl.
"The mother in our family entered so naturally, perhaps the mother never talked to me in relations," she thinks Eva.
A few places?
We're at least close.
Due Ema and Ela were born to the Caesarea River after Eva had been diagnosed in the end of the diagnostic diagnostics.
This is the failure of production and the activities of yellow cylins, which are then in the override quantities of blood, and are particularly shown by the witness.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fruit that causes a pre-term birth and death, in the majority of the mothers after the cause is self-free.
Emma and Ela were born to Evin and your luck, even when they were first in 36th weeks.
The Emich was placed in the incubator on the intermediary division, where Vashko's netter works, which has been able to overcome and live.
Elinka was greater and immediately after the JIP transfer to my room, I had her with me, describes the periods for Eva.
In the birthday, the doctors had no choiced to leave a miniacle that was able to achieve the border of two miles.
Waiting to gather children in Eve’s birthday, but it wasn't done.
"I've been crazy after my husband and children," she remembers a hard moment for the division of six hundreds of four-minute mother.
She considered her husband and the signature of reverse, except for the unexpected access to one of the doctor.
But at the end, the doctors left Eva and two girls to the housework.
Four entirety and birds are sent to CT1 in the wedding evening at 21:45 hours.
The total number of family can be disturbed.
They live together in a small house apart from Pray, where Eva had to get enough with electrical double-to-do-do-do.
The house wasn't achieved, but Yoursek made Eve a joy for the mounting of a floor steel to be prepared for six persons more appropriate.
If it's not, we'll take care of the taxi.
Eva is convinced that children have taken a family affair and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or the disaster of the house.
But we've made a lot better than we've waited.
Not the order is hidden in a small space, and we are sometimes exceeding the mixture, but at least all we are near, Eva, who can be able to find a positive page on every situation.
Your labour of lighter in the film is not a closing of a regular acceptor.
That is why sometimes they're going to the travel streets as a taxi.
In its sixty years, according to their words, the money of the family and the children will be physically controlled, how long will it be?
"I know that, in view of our eternal difference, I will be one time I will live this family," admits Eva on the round in question on the future.
It would be a pleasure to return to the employment, but it is more favorable for its own business.
With four children, I'm not for the employee.
And when it's the worst, we can take a taxi with our husband, it's a sympatic blonde.
Apple posted a joe effect.
Everything can spread.
More executive Processor, photographing with larger solution, stronger shapes or displaying the recognised power of doctrine, are recently present for the iPhones nine generations.
These two lasts also have negative impact on iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The Applu's Apple Trend was that each new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous.
The exception was only three and fourth generations that the importance of the earlier iPhones has increased.
Duegram substance differences in the unexpected news was therefore very increasing.
However, it doesn't pay for new iPhones far away.
In contrast to the iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the entire quantity has grown in a smaller model of 14 grams, at the largest of the 20 grams.
On one side it can't be surprised, the lonely affair in the Apple capsheets has a lonely threatened.
The six news is likely from the highest slitin 7000, which also rejected the weight.
But there's a lot of greater impact on her.
Apple also used the 3D Touch technology in the newspaper, which shows the power of the doctrine.
This was necessary to maintain further capacity sensors.
The smoothness of the new iPhones has increased more than twice than the previous generation.
In the smaller iPhone from the beginning of 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of the 19 to 40 grams.
In iPhone 6s, the most difficult component is used.
The smoothness of only 143 grams is then achieved in this newspaper and thanks to the reserve railway, which has been covered by most of the remaining components.
In the largest model, it is the hardest use of battery element, however, its importance is not changed by the previous leader.
And in this case, the largest growth is just at the difference.
Weight 5,5" iPhone 6s Plus, so we have 192 grams.
How many new technologies will display practices, it will appear until the use.
First users will be able to test this on Friday 25 September when the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus is started in the selected countries.
Are the shopping shoes for 10,000 years?
In Italian Grotta Paglicci, the archeologists gave aneez that opens interesting opportunities.
They discovered the pieces of a modern person from various times, including smooth shapes, rest of tools, and so far and similar.
At the level 23A, which is based on tools for the period of 30 thousand years, but the scientists have discovered something that very reminds the rest of the dinner buffet.
In the same way, the pieces of open shirts were found, of course, through the production process of such popular flowers today.
The smoke is first in her today, then the smoke, the smoke, the smoke, the smoke, and the shoes, and the shoes, and the shoes, and the shoes.
In the skin of Paglicci, the cerebral that was held or burned, and then, obviously, was divorced between two milk stones - at least, the feet of use on two stones in the skin.
Therefore, the scientists did not prove in their publication for the PNAS magazine to admit that the complete production process of the floor would be in the skin, but the likeness is really very ideal.
We don't have any evidence of how people could eat, but the idea that it was with some technology and that might be too dark, of course it is fully logical.
It is also a very interesting evidence of how intensive people have used the worms long ago before landscape.
If that is the correct interpretation, the oldest flowers of the agriculture have passed up for twenty thousand years.
A new report of the station in the Transport Affairs City Brna.
So I heard again to report the name of the staff in the troleybus: Hunshake, Psychiatric, Frazova, Spratecka.
Of course, Trolejbus was a lot more deep, so the report of a man’s voice was less understandable than before when the stakes were published by a woman’s voice.
The woman's voice is higher, so in the deepest depth of the transport move is better known than the deepest man's voice.
The DPMB arguments that this speaker has chosen themselves -- I don't know who, who didn't ask me anybody, but they have certainly chosen from the studies based in a simple silence, which, of course, had seen very different than in the bus engine.
I live in Brna for a few decades of years, so the right names of all these staffs I know remember, so I don't need this report, but strangers who don't know in Brna and for which these reports are particularly defined, may be disturbed and can be able to be cut down and to the end where they have been achieved, and then say that the stage that they had to go out there wasn't been completely.
It may be the choice of the speaker - but it's better to do again, and this time subcolored with a regular transport height and a motor racket, where the player's in the bus almost lost.
So we don't need to listen to the names of the Water Herspeech Station, Schmier, or then Ponorna in the pitching smoke where I passed in Comara.
I imagine my stereo hearing was not so much in the only day when the stakeholder changed.
Before that day, I felt good to the report.
Good morning, ma'am.
From the letters of the trailer.
Today, a lot of people knows what the greatest and most intelligent governments have been, including complex achievements.
I allowed me to remind you of it.
The bus was late.
I've been in the office at the moment when the radio stated that it was just seven hours.
"You're happy that you didn't steal with the judge of the officer, you came a minute before you, and it seems she's not equal to the reach," he noted the disecher while I wrote to the book of the arrivals.
Thank you, I'll give you a bitch.
Write me that I'm going after the circuits to the review of a detailed mechanism.
It's not gonna happen. It's just a test today.
Everybody's disappointment until it's worse.
What really is it?
"But you're seeing," he liked a disaster.
You'll be the next one.
I've gone on the way.
There the gate was opened, and the officer appeared.
It's a stone face, in a complete falling steen round.
"Good morning, Mr. Master," I healed a courageously and quickly touched two buttons from the bottom.
"Good morning," she called the answer, and I went quickly into the second mother, and I didn't understand a famous, a famous ton who's ancient answer.
"You're playing," announced me Eva's engineer, the lady who I've been very worried.
It was even a damn thing before the judges sent her.
They're shooting, and you're getting a tattoo.
How many times I asked what are these complex explosives, but nobody wants to talk about it.
They're almost one for three years, they've got all of them, and it's too unbelievable.
At least for some.
I'll see you soon.
I went out with the shulet fascinated with periodic reports and the phone.
"Then Holcman, come to me immediately," he cried out the voice of the officer.
What's going on?
Now we've met and nothing... I've missed, but no one answered me, everybody just with his thoughts.
"Good day, the judge of the officer, I came to your order," I turned out, I went into the officer.
The captain was sitting on the write table and looked at some teacher.
"I'm going to get a mechanism," he spoke a minute, and he didn't take his head, and still watched the teacher, "Your behavior doesn't like me."
He declined the leather on the table, fell into the pitch of the pit, and he tried to me as a normal, unbelievable, evil, awful view.
I missed it.
What's going on?
Yesterday, he blessed that I worked very well after the couple of months in the function, and that he was happy with me.
That the officer did very well when he got me out of the chat to a distance.
And now?
I know that you're a technology of the travel distance and you have to keep it.
The welcome you used this morning is just inacceptable.
I loved that I used such a health from the child that I was so exhausted and that I don't see anything bad on it.
It was like a red shooter on the stage.
"You're on socialistic ferry and the only acceptable health is the honour of the work," the explodered officer.
And more, you're still cutting up the shoes of the overseers.
One time you'll say "pan" and the second one's "soud" again.
It's just me, I'm not a Mr. Leader, but the judge of the officer.
The employees are the judges of the employees, the top traitors are the judges of the Supreme Traitors!
Remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... I'm a judge of the officer, but... but I've guaranteed you with a regular citizen health.
But it's not bad... and it's honour of work or judgment... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your presence that you're not on the side," he stuckly brought the coffee that was a little quiet.
But there's still a word about it.
Anyway remember that you don't have a prejudice in the front of the top.
That wasn't good.
When the officer said to someone that something is not his presence, it wasn't looking good.
I've been looking for the words I would answer.
I also had his higher pressure.
He was just for a few years old and played the Lord, actually a judge.
Little, fooled, authorised, arogantic, how it was on the moment.
They're all out of him.
Well, it's a chairman.
In fact, not all, the President of the Party organization was to him as all of the parties, but also the non-shirts, he touched him.
But the officer touched many, especially those who could apply his superstition.
He just shoot me for a full crown now.
I thought something about the fucking shit, and I stayed a lot of suffering that I didn't shoot it in his face.
It's just I'd never go back to the shoes to the cromps, so I'd still do the officer.
What would I like to use two kids?
And the ransom!
I was in the crazy, but I've got it.
I'm not gonna make him happy here.
"It's all right, you can go," finished the audience and began to watch the teacher that had before in his hand.
At half of the twelve, they called me.
All of the offices were already there and questions about what and how, they answered, yes, that's gonna be good.
Just Jojain's coast, as he was normal, that they can't all get us out of the way because the work should be judged with his faithful ones, and that's not worried.
The word "soudrug" was then impressed as if he knew why the old man shot me in the morning.
It's been a good conscience in the room.
The Court of the Court on his writer's table and on the long Council table, another judges who had to decide on my official residence or have no longer.
The Chairman, the ROH President, the writer of the personal, the reference for special purposes, something in order to confront the war, and the office, my boss.
And also the most important person, the President of the Party Organization.
I knew him from the shoes.
A normal training worker, robbed the ship or the white house of the branch.
But the old kids too.
I heard that this time there was no funeral, a beautiful beast.
The bad languages claimed that the school went out in the seventh class, I didn't touch anything, he didn't touch.
And when the criminal was interrupted, he finished the shoes at the crown.
But the judge, yes, the judge was hidden!
The captain has shown me to sit down.
She was in me a little soul, a damn shoe.
The chairperson reads the court of the citizen committee from a resident place.
I'm going from the employee family, I'm married, two kids and so far.
It's good yet, I thought, and I've had a worm better.
Then the office of the street organization of the sides.
He copied a court from the citizen committee, maybe they both wrote the same person.
It's just happening!
Parents of the Member States have refused to take up before the Commission's executive and finally out of the parties, in addition to health reasons.
The captain looked at me.
The coffee took it out and stopped reading.
The captain said he had to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM Committee, and there was a candidate.
Without the parents who went out of the side, the page gave me confidence.
Only I married and wedding outside the national committee, I was also in the coach.
My trust of the side, I made it the worst way.
That's why I've been cut off of her candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I left both children to be baptized, and even Mom died, I told the church grave, although it was about the previous member of the party.
This is all I give the negative positions to the leadership of the parties.
When the coffee was read, only the smoking of the shoes to the table was interrupted.
Everyone looked honestly on me, and I wanted to be a lot of far away.
Then I still repeated in the spirit "Communists - supermerciers, communists."
Why didn't I stay in the cookers?
I could also be able to edit the exchanges.
But now?
Cariero's officer took her before she started.
Come back to the chat?
Maybe it's not going. The officer's probably gonna tell me for a hour.
"I agree how you have checked the judge here?", The writer stopped the writer's silent question on the coffee.
Well, according to the cause of the previous employment.
Do you have him here?
It wasn't obviously too much.
He was nervously smoking on the smoking of the pool, as he was checked himself.
Horlyn's smoking and put a paper to the officer.
"No,," he brought the officer with a sign of illness, which often was the prevention of the balls.
In the first view of the same glory, learned with the declaration, studied the industrial, worked in the middle of work as a cluster, normally fulfilled in average of a hundred and twenty percent.
It's just the basic thing.
From where you took the judge, the judge?" He turned again to the coffee that felt that it began to turn against him and that he would not have to be a cockpit.
Here's the judge gave me her, at the ransom.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the chat," cut the coffee.
And they don't want the grounds there, he was sometimes, so I gave him to a folder.
"That's why, when the technical function was driving you this prisoner's office, "which was the officer.
The damn smelled nervously, and there was nothing to answer.
"It's not, we're going to do it later," concluded the case of the coffee and the coffee was obviously lying.
I mean, you've stayed.
"What about you, judge?" The officer returned to me again.
It's the first time I'll get out, so it's the end!
I've been smoking in my eyes, I've got a horse.
He followed the reputation and accusation, and I knew that I was the most resistant creation in the world that doesn't serve self-minded mercy.
That I made a defense of an imperfect jurisdiction in the absence of the Code Referency Court, which I didn't understand why the court was incomplete when I got it from the coffee in the manufacturer.
I am also an antisocialistic living that, during the construction of real socialism, supports the renew of religious darkness, ba, even part of them.
Because, it was a lot of things I've spent, or maybe I'm still sleeping, and I prayed to end it.
I was all one.
I was just one that I'm going out of the mechanism's place.
I was just one that I'd take the crown.
It's a work for honorable and gentle people, not for the enemy of the people who I was in the eyes of the judge.
"It would be enough, Mr President," he called the President of the parties on the same time and fully interrupted the levitic levies.
Here the judge made a mistake, a great mistake.
What a mistake, he did right out!
It's just he's got his trespass!
Don't forget that, I'm the judge of the officer!
What can be worse for a young man than we close the door for time!
To open him again, he'll have to show that he has changed that it's our trust again.
The unsearched bacher talked like a book.
Where did it get in him?
Is he so numbered or pitched the front of the party school and met?
That is why this young judge also needs to get a chance from us!
The chance to show that he has changed.
And who's gonna give her if you don't just, I'm the judge of the officer?
It's your responsibility for this young, true, if the judging judge is to support his effort for transport!
It's your side commitment that nobody will save you!
Actually, it's a side commitment to all of us.
Here the judge must see that the side hasn't forgotten.
She's not just punished as a loving mother, but she's also loved.
When the President ended, nobody didn't look at it.
Nobody expected such a situation.
At least me.
"I agree with you, the President's counsel," the counseler attempts to review the initiative.
If you had to let me talk, you would hear I just made this end.
They were all consently invisible, but they had to see that they didn't believe him nor a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of the other basic reference," I threw back to the office, and I broke up.
Even though, except Euy's ingegners, they were all at lunch.
I heard my incompatible treatment of favourite experiences, and I was quiet.
When I finished, she asked if I'd give a coffee.
She didn't wait for the answer, she put water on the wheel and lost the skins.
It was at least discussed of the quadratic practices.
As a judge, often full of praise, gives a man to the hand, and the other in which the town is a cup, sends a new employee.
Only I didn't end where I had, but on the shoes of the cramps, so the judges of the manufacturers didn't know where they should send it.
What about our coffee?
He's gonna be born where he's eating or hidden, and so, finally, it's what happened.
"It's from the old shoe," she felt wrongly.
I'm sure he's not gonna hurt him today.
Take care of him, it's too courageous.
And the partner president?
Based on a lower officer, no humanitarian.
None of the cromper has a great power.
The coffee's water has started to smoke, and the office has filled the coffee that is right.
I've put a sugar coat in the steel, and my kids have a horrible medicine.
Maybe I'm from the worst outside.
Now they're not cutting me, and there are three years.
Everything, the judge of the officer will not forget that day.
Exited in the LITERATION TO TRAT II. in the EPICA manufacturer
I'm alone alive.
The wind rounds on Chlum's winds back for years.
It's going to see a far away because it's located at 15 meters of a high staff.
People of the wide around call him the wind on Chlum.
For the other, 150 citizens were even one of the elements of the general mark that the citizens had received the opportunity for the age in 2010.
"Now we asked a sign and wind, of course, we wanted to have a sign, he knows him around everybody," became an elder of Jiri Maseh.
Chrome wind smoke is a local technology memory.
It's a little while now: she reminds the time when the people were fighting about quality water.
That in Chlum in the past century was an excessive.
In 1910, chlamic employees decided to resolve, which were then exposed to half the eighth years.
In the neighborhood in Chichev, they left 7 meters of the deep source.
Three years later, the brown was fulfilled with a wind skin, which was cut into the reserve in the highest side of the outside, near the bottom.
"Stavbu has carried out Antonín Kunc from Hranic at the cost of 2 400 corns," indicates a memory record on the appropriate restriction of the construction of the staff.
In 1971, several branches of wind rounds and falls were able to achieve in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, the new chapter of water was started writeing: that day in Chlum began to serve a new water.
The wind smoke has already remained only with a non-functional symbol and a ratio.
The Dominicant's leaving at the airport of the roads.
At 2008, Chlums decided that the wind rounds would be raised again and bring again to the way.
They left to create a replica of the original round - reduced in average half a meter.
The colo was attached to the officer, however, at the end of the year, it had to be dreamed down.
The manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the role did not have to arise to the wind winds.
Then the cloud dominant repeated a few years.
However, from the June of the aircraft, the round on the high staff again.
In the opportunity of the conspiracy of the roads, the parent left the replication of the round and raised it again on the top of the yellow wheel.
But the role is a smoke of useful water from the bronze just in the overflowing white branch.
And for a year, we totally disconnected him because there was a little water in the bowl.
It's at least amazing.
"After then, the wind rounds of the smoke in the woods, we'll reconnect again," explained the ancient Masehek.
Chlum is not the only foreign in the Germany where the wind round has arrived in the current sign, but it is the only wheel of this kind on the whole High.
The similar elements in the character have a number of local technical memorys, for example, in Chvalkovics and Green Mountains at the Exchwitz, in Kugel on Hodonish, Partutututututuvics in the Forest, or in Police in Vietnam.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafatu, she accepted the opponent Tripolis Goian.
"I remember very well against Slavia, and my hair, like all in my carriage," the 34-year-old Goyan was married for the pre-print conference.
That time George Hagi trained us, it was a funeral we lost.
I hope I'll give Sparty a hair now.
It's just the difference that we're not going this time," Goian continued.
This man who had 60 excuses for a Roman representative is a key front of the Greek team.
It's like a stairt to travel the Spanish Owens.
A couple of thousands of people, there are no hell, says about the Greek Short Heart Hybsch.
And it's part of what you can wait for him on the fourth night.
I know Fataie who played a Roman Astor with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all of them.
I know that it's a very good attacker, so he also went to Sparty, said Goian.
Another photobalists of the Prash club did not mention, and then there came a question right if he knows David Lafat, the best shot in the history of the Czech Ligue and Captain Sparty.
Goian was mourning, and with a lot of looking at the Chess newspapers.
"Why do you ask me?"
He's silent in a minute.
We saw some videos and I realized Sparta plays a lot of teams.
He's really a good player.
Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else except Fataie.
That's the spectacular about Goyan knows very well.
"I have experiences from the major clubs, it's going to say that he keeps the protection of Asteras, it's their game organizator," observed the Spanish assistent Stanislav Hejkal.
Goyan has already the best year behind himself, but he can make a very interesting photoball library.
His time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester's whole of the United and City, but from Steauy was married to the Italian Palerma, playing and playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unnormal style, says the trainer.
Sparta is a great team, regularly playing European eggs, a pearl of winning in the Czech lies.
It's a favorite person for me in this box, but we're playing home and we want to start a good result.
Like Sparta, we're trying to win, he brought Goian.
I'm in the room with the Slovakian branch of Thomas Košic, who's very happy for the support of the Czech.
Me too.
But after the whole team, I can say we'll fight hardly.
The coffee goes from Poland to Czech, considers the entrance of the bottle.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostra.
Coffee S.A. was registered in Poland because of business with businesses in the Warshaw town.
Our primary goal is to have a group sitting in the Czech Republic.
The steps that we have passed on in the framework of the project are highly legal and administrative and have no effective impact on society, says Daniel Buryš, the Financial Director of the Cofola Group.
"In accordance with the movement of the groups of actions consider the location of actions on the floor."
For entering the Burz of Price Papers of Praha, Praha ends the prospect of the price paper which provides in the nearest time of the Czech National Bank for approval.
The movement of the holding seed and the relevant transfers of action will be conducted in a form of public non-public transactions with that only remaining actors will be participated on it.
In the framework of this operation, no action will be provided for public or new investors.
"The proposal of action to new investors would be done - but if the company and its operators are decided - later, and it would be on 4th of 2015 or on 1th January 2016," she brought the company.
The company has already stated that the eventual actions could be complied with the emission of new actions or sales of existing actions.
This item could be able to contribute from the benefits of action in the Republic of the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of actions and the warshaw room.
Test of the Czech TV objectives in information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test objectives and exports of the reporting of the main Chess media on the surgical crisis.
This time sends the main reporting session of the Czech TV.
How'd she stay?
When you are going to learn in the faculty of journalists about how the media can manipulate reality, they can leave today’s e-mail of the Czech TV Events.
Migrant crisis has been offered at least 80% of reporting.
At the first minute, when the TT reported about diseases on the Serbia-Madian border and migrant attacks on the police, it was called eufemisticly to them patience - stones and shoots the rocks), it was now more migrant propaganda - raise the names of individual reporters.
Criticals of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-circa organizations criticising bad migrants.
Syrian Children in Czech School - history of the Syrians integrated in CRR.
It's not just like a threat, but also like a chance.
The exemption of the exemptors - the CT uses the expressions of a migrant or a migrant.
It is principally the fact that the CTs in illustrations uses exactly, and only the cases for small children and women.
In the same sentence, she said that 80% of men from the migrants held in the Czech.
Agreement: Most of the propaganda, which has no periods of communist actors.
I have to say that I'm as a old newspaper.
Ecoology in practice.
When I was on the panel, I just stopped to be the only citizen.
I had fishing fishermen on a card ship.
Home fishes, smiles with unconsolidated variation, such as, non-producing the ransom from the house to the branch and the young one seems like adult, it's just a small and progressive growth.
I was contraried, and I didn't touch them.
First of the hands and later and chemicals.
Socialistic drugs on their liquidation offered some blue cristals.
I think it was called Cyclon B.
Or somebody else?
However, it's successful.
Afterward, I made it the same thing with Pharaoh.
A crabic with some juveniles who carried out in the ground, and then he didn't allow the king to generate a new seed.
But I've got it.
As the time was gone, it was also the threat of my mind, and I continued to think they had the same right to life as we people.
Moreover, I had experienced that the ecosystic income is not to succeed, and one of the shooter can replace the other.
The truth at the bed and the feast I wouldn't like to disappoint the karm of their killing.
In the new lives, we agreed with the partner that if we don't have fish to treat us for a shoe, let them eat the shoes of a deck, some of those invisible rows and similar.
Their peaceful existence after the time has broken the ball.
It was a typical trainer who sat a long time on the trap.
We had to have that he lives from sometimes muscles and cameras that just increased comfort.
Because of a few years, we discovered that he lives mainly with fishermen and that their number was obviously maintained in a lot of number.
Trust regular contact at each need that we needed to find that it's a self-made.
We were also witnesses of romantic conversation with partners, like a third-term smaller, as carefully branching on the throat of the puzzle, so that it would not be sealed before it gets outcome.
It was about three days when they didn't move and did not react to our controls.
Under the west room where the favorite games were played, we found the rest of the self - broken one later.
Then the ball wasn't gone for a long week.
When we thought that it's already behind him, we were surprised of a lot of small patterns, and I'm going to compare with her around.
They're almost lost.
They were saved by a mother's deal, and they were divorced with others.
Even a smoke left somewhere after a week.
If she goes to another, we don't know, but after two months, she's revealed on the street.
Actually, about something less, probably the daughter of the west passengers.
Sometimes from the tree, we have observed our behavior and movement under the western ship has determined our disasters as friendship.
The number of fish has renewed again, and the fish has seen his regular activities to ensure food.
We haven't changed our ecosystem all year.
Our daughter has grown up to the age when the use of the night has already been busy.
We've tolerated it here, but the end of his content has already been interested in us.
We've chosen it still more to use the resource.
However, the daughter found a vote in the challenge that she had seen very well when she was depressed.
Our words about that the damn man saw, happiness in the house wasn't taken.
I worried, and I cried out of her night.
It wasn't enough.
She's got a moment when she had to have a ball, in the interest of the development of the daughter's dream.
It's left for me.
He was departed into the cluster and was released through the ballon somewhere to the garden.
I walked with him as a friend, but soon after a long use, I felt wounded as if I'd get out of a relative.
We imagined that fisheries are starting to discover more and start to multiply a geometric range.
The world's wonderful, weeks, two, we haven't appeared there.
I started looking for the cause.
I thought that if the box had been there after the model of marvines, it would not have grown out that the west environment is not so worthy for their existence as we thought.
But then the first cocks of the middle size appeared, and they've already held up again.
I had to imagine another theory about the cause of their exemption, and I came to the fact that they had to have a reason to have that when they don't see him that it is hidden in some other place and that they're dangerous from anywhere.
Or, maybe there were some telepatical connections with their predominant and his quick exchange in them was called a reaction.
I don't make any illusion about their faces.
Some cookhost lights showed, but they'd react to the hands or quick moves, it's not.
The daughter's already going to the west.
I think she's forgotten at night.
It's just gonna get a stick again.
I'm sending my friends to the ethnic, and I hope they didn't shut up on me after that execution.
Otherwise, we should use this Cyclone B.
Deterior of the exhibition of Albert Instein, which has inherited the world.
The terms of genetic scientists from the past century, of course, the humanity will never stop fascinating.
He made it so deep, that the exposure was always a great deal.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the understanding of people, he entered in particular his special and general relationship theory, which later describes the universe in its gigantic dimension.
It can also be rejected by the photo effect or the thinking of the quantification of the electromagnetic field.
It isn't sure that the same description and the compatibility of the popular relationship theory is for many so satisfied that for the neighborhood notices, it is more easier to vote.
But it's not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein, even if he had not found a geniusly uniform form of explaining: the hour near your love is looking for a minute; a minute in the mountain fish seems to be a hour - and it's relative.
I allowed me to choose those ten who have been fully kept me from his entire holidays.
Intelligent people are trying to resolve problems, genetically trying to do it.
Only two things are infinite.
Injured the human dumb.
I'm not so sure at the first.
No number of trials can't prove that I had the truth.
But the only time he can prove that I was wrong.
But it's a hard time when it's easier to distract atom than to destroy the courts.
If there's no order on the table in order in the mind, what then turns the empty table?
I don't know what's going to fight in the third world war, but in that fourth, it's gonna be crazy and stones.
There are thousand ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
A lot of knowledge is dangerous and too much knowing.
If I would have been available for an hour to control my life, I would train 40 minutes by his study, 15 minutes of his analysis and 5 minutes by his solution.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand the gift of the accusation.
I can't forgive Einstein's formula to definite success: if we take A for success, pays the model: A=X+Y+Z, where X is working, Y relax, and Z is keeping the language for dances.
New modern.
The hospitals in Zentral countries expect changes for 1,5 billion.
"It's a success when we notice that all this year all four are holding in black numbers," stated Mr. Stanislav Mishaka.
The total rate of national devices is at the moment about 32 million corners.
The parts of this are mainly higher limits from ensure that are similar to the aeroplane.
It also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Croatia, Vestina, Uferian and Zenna, it is covered by the buildings that will be at least 1,5 billion corners.
The long time we've buyed the main devices, it's over.
Now we have to begin to build new buildings, because without them the smoking health will not be done, it has caused the plans of the national destination for the health of Lubomir Neatem.
The changes are happy in all the hospitals.
The officers will come to the hospital the next year.
In the Western now, the additor of a new internal pavilion for at least 300 million corners.
In Croatia, they have a dialysis design.
The U.S. Radians wants to be an open central pavillon for a new intern for over 200 million.
And the disease of Batthou is waiting for a long-term establishment of a new central accommodation and internal, which will need three four billion.
In all cases, it is often the most important changes in the last years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," she reported to the establishment of the Vestinian internal director of the hospital Viror Prousk.
Five-path buildings must be prepared for two years and offer comfortable emergency for intern and neurology, dialyse, new ambulance, bed and a single intensive care.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are explicitly recognised by patients will be covered by all regions.
The new buildings, for example, replace those in which many diseases in one room, have only one toalet, beds are unlimitable, the windows of unfortunate and healthy, do not correspond to conditions for work.
"For example, our internal was established for fifty years, and now they are on the border of his life," Paul Calabek manager of the Silencing hospital.
It is therefore replaced by a number of years the seven modern building connected with urgent accommodation.
The doctors and patients will also have all actor divisions in one place, especially in new spaces.
The same model already has half of the Uherian Radians.
The central accommodation is already staying, and in three years it's gonna come to him.
"Stavbu, we'll pay from the trust and partly from its own funds," explained Director Peter Sladek.
This hospital can just allow its own funding as the only in the country.
The race is still the highest and the loss has not been even two years ago when the cycle’s hospital had to be taken at least 20 miles of loss.
"We have a good agreement with confidentiality, a great committee, we increase the receives and actually lead costs in the whole hospital," says the Proprietary of the Waider, who has an economy on care.
The improvement is also expected to be patients with incredible hospitals.
During 10 to 15 years, new devices and rebuilding to half billion corn will go to the correction.
Years will be prepared for a safe station, then the dialysis is starting, in case the construction of buildings for a new magnetic restaurant.

Nobody explained me how I had to keep the advocate officers in the country when they don't want to live in the Czech.
The Ministry in Milan Chovanec (CHSSD), after treatment with their European colleagues, rejects that other Member States of the Czech press to accept the cost for transformation of the surface, but deny any discussion.
He also hopes that nobody explained him how to keep the attached surgicals in Czech when they don't want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and so we wanted the quotes to be exhausted from the final text," said Chovanec's newspapers.
Can you be able to describe the position you have come to operate ministers in the field of the European Union?
We don't agree with the required costs as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like sol or moon pills.
They're living lives that have some visions that are directed to anywhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from the colleagues how we can migrants in the country of Member States to maintain their retribution.
We can't imagine that.
We didn't get the answer, and so we wanted the quotes to be exhausted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional challenges, then registering places, border protection, campaigns besides Europe, a comprehensive fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem.
We're talking about this year, and we're saying this is the way.
But to say the county's going to solve everything?
Recently, we solved 40 thousand, now it's 100 twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do you keep people in that field?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who travel through us want to go to Germany.
We just don't know how to keep it here.
We have an ambient to go to other strangers, Ukraine, Vietnamians, and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, we have asyles, but interesting people from this migrant field, so from Syria and other countries is a limited zero.
You've missed that they really don't want to, but for 15 hundred people we've already been able to accept.
Couldn't they accept this way more?
We've been engaged to accept 1500 people, but with a condition.
We said, functional challenges, border protection, military operations.
And in those 1500, it's about 1100 people with which we're making the asylum procedure.
They're coming to our detentive device and we'll keep them like those we've got.
It's a great question, and we will discuss with Europe if we can hold people registered in Italy and Greece, accidentally in Hungary.
Because Europe's doing so that if they have registration, they can't be arrested.
This means, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, we can not keep those 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go again to Germany.
If we are able to keep them after the axis management, we will prepare the procedure of asylum with them.
If the Syrian, Eritrea, is at least 98 per cent of the European statistics get international protection.
Then they will receive evidence that will allow them to travel through Europe.
And I think these people will end again in target countries.
Then there's four hundred people who's going to move.
It's a second project that still deals, and we just continued to discuss the churches about the possibilities that they could help them to employee, dwelling, and so far.
But it's a lot of long time.
You said that the officers were not able to discuss with us.
But isn't that the Czech Republic rejects the costs, but doesn't there have any solidarity step that would discuss here?
And what exactly should this be the solidarity step under you?
If the Republic of Germany states the proposal that all migrants of Syria can be with them, this report will be wide in a number of hours after all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's going to make another migration ball that directs to Germany because they just don't want us.
We think the path is the protection of the external border - just to raise the migrant bowls, to help the needed, and to divide economic migrants.
I mean, to show them that they don't have chances.
Only for a long year in Germany, 50 thousand Kosovans arrived.
From the Security Cosova, where we pay all the saturity of this State, including police, courts, State detention.
If we could separate them and not accept them, or only accept them according to economic need, then those 50 percent of what the social systems are struggling on them today could go to the surface.
In contrast to the first day when Germany carried the control, the number of arrested in the Czech.
Now it's eight, the first day it was twelve.
Where's it going to get the controls on the borders?
We were afraid of a hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can control.
We still have some hundred free spaces in stone detention devices.
Of course, all the people we're holding, we'll be back to Rakousca seven days.
We're doing it standardly.
The ransoms are the only ones who take us the people, with the Hungarian, it's complicated and the Greeks -- it's a lot of history.
So, where's that point of crime?
Does it have to be a thousand day?
I think it should be a few hundred days.
Two hundreds, three hundreds of people two days, three days after they're going, we're able to achieve the crisis plans.
Then I agreed to Mr. President that he would immediately call for an extraordinary government.
He's very interesting about everything, we're sometimes in the phone contact.
If this situation is established, the Government may sit immediately and decide to send the police on the army, we will give the full administration, in case of prison service.
The national variation is an extraordinary status that now has reported to Hungary in some places?
I think it can't get to us so far.
Consider that our position is different, we are the national state in the framework of Europe, the schengen border we have only and only aircraft.
I don't know what's going to happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to broadcast information.
All information that we have to, to be already from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, test that Hungary will try to decline a migration to Croatia and Slovakia, which would then mean the right path to Korea.
The Republic of the Czech would be very marginal, at least.
Slavia spent a large part of the debts for the last time.
He's trying to refuse the statement of the accident.
Fotbal Slavia sold payments.
Their money were waiting for photobactics.
Fotbal Slavia was established in an outer first because of the insolvency management before the court.
At least three months after that, 20 million corners were offered a proposal for Online Services from the Times Samoa.
Slavie Zuzana Young Slave tried to judge Michael Wenzlo for a few hours to convince that she had no cases over Slavia.
And I needed to say that she had a argument.
One of the main arguments was that the past week with the new Slavie's new Maintainer became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and also the Chinese billion of Jiri Shiman.
Obviously, from new leaders to the club got money, and the last time.
This shows also the explanation of Slavie before the outer court treatment - the top club in the lunch, only the day before the judgment, sent ten million corners.
"All was slaughtered between 11 September and 15 September," said Slavie Young.
Who's Slavia paying?
Current and old players and business partners.
For example, the Slovakian representative of Milan Ivano or the Czech booker of Mariu Ličko.
Slavia also offered an offering to Agent Alexandra Losenic.
In the fifth club, he also paid the town part of Praha 10.
The parts of the insolvency sports remain only the searches that Slavie repairs.
It wasn't able to be deleted according to the club of the obligations, or they're leaving the court sports.
However, we are prepared to pay these parts in the case of the permission of these sports.
"We have the needs of a bank account, which we can add a statement from the account," said the jurisdiction of the young lawyer.
"All that was after the ransom is slaughtered," announced the young man and added that non-reciprocated are only inadequate or distributed obligations.
Of course, it is also that in the nearest days, the judgment will be unresoluted and the management will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the detailed payments.
Finally, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision may therefore be expected first in November.
Court of Justice established the continuing operation on third November.
However, the decision will not fall on this meeting, but it will be written after it.

FastMig X is the representative of the most recent generation of investment resources.
The combination of skin technology, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modulary construction brings the benefits and the speed of investment in a way of high quality, productivity and compatibility.
FastMig X is a modulary system, so the final session is always configured according to the requirements of the contacters.
And whatever, from the switching of constructive oils after the sliting of special slitins, such as from the smoking of the severe materials after the smoking of dark feet, from appliance in parts and after the shipment.
Incredible quantity of carbons, simple setup and extension of the carbon resources allows quickly to respond to the change of requirements, which leads to reducing spaces, to the need for reform of resources and productive smoking.
FastMig X allows the collection of smoking processes by the Kemppi companies that ensure the higher production and quality of smoking.
The loss of time is stopped, and it is not possible to explore materials or to edit false cereals.
It's ensuring flexibility, it's less spaces, more smoking and higher profit.
It's a airport news that had a Premier in Niter, where she also got gold medal.
These respects we are very careful because they confirm the exception of the product.
The previous world manufacturers can explore similar systems, but thanks to the differences in the software and in the management of the parameters are FastMig X to the world's springs.
The employees are sure nice and added periods that are moved around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already carried out the first contacts that will certainly be expanded after the branch branches.

The white went to make it so that it wouldn't be done.
But it would still be about half billion more, says a company who projected the tunnel.
The white went down and safe, says the officer.
The Tunel Complex Blanca was possible to establish two lands falls in the Forest Airport, the manufacturer of Satra company, which is the main projector, Alexander Butovicz.
He said it in the middle of the office at the newspaper of the tunnel.
But it would be likely about half billion corners.
The leaders are opening in the Sunday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"Tunel was going to raise safe, but the costs were grown exponed," said Butovič.
The conditions in the Stromovice were the same for all the time, although the country was only a few steps from the place where he started to raise more safe and careful methods.
"If this measure was used for 500 meters before, it would be half billion better,," said Butovicz.
The white tunnel was threatened during the stage.
Twice, in 2008, a shorter occurred in the Stromovice, in 2010, the deadly departed in the Ministry of Culture in Praia 6.
According to the Director of Metrostav of Jiri-Belohlava, the tunnel is too nice, he said to the week.
The state had 17 billion corners according to the original purpose.
When we calculate the DPH that has been two times exhausted, you have 11 billion.
When you read the technology, the outcome of lands and ingenerary activities, evaluation and similar items, it's 29 billion, which isn't already from 37 to so far, he brought the Whitehead.
Somebody's paying it and paying it.

FedExu cyclopedia, reduction of fishing spectrum for 2016
The FedEx Community reported uncomfortable results for the last fourth year and a large reduction of the proposals of the target rate due to the low question after costs and higher costs for the ground division.
The Community also concluded that it plans to be at least 55 000 sezon workers.
In this long-term period, FedEx reported that the company would take 50,000 Sezon Workers' empty.
Company actions have at least 2,5 per cent in pre-trading 45 minutes before the central opening.
The FedEx Community indicates that it expects the division between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fishing year, which ends the next floor, which means 20 cents of the previous proposal.
The analysis expected $10.84, according to the investigation of the FactSet company.
The reduced view comes in the midst of 4,9 per cent of rate sazes, which appears in January 4. and higher payments for the ground transport of hard or large packages starting in November.
The Community stated that the growth of the rate of the past year is still expected by reducing costs, higher accommodation and growth in online trade.
The President of the Presidency and the General Director of the Company Fred Smith said that "the company has made a firm execution in the areas of harder than expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The plans of empty labour were announced after the UPS Rival Company reported that he had at least 90 000 to 95 000 workers, which probably is like the last year.
In the fourth year, which ended in August 31, the FedEx company received $692 million, which is about 6% more than the last year.
The rate of action did $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for action, which was provided for 12 analysis by Zacks Investment Research.
The costs increased by 5 per cent, $12.3 billion.
Six analysis of Zacks was waiting for $12.23 billion.
The FedEx community was launched in the last years, including the priority of the international ship transport, which has made us to get up in its expensive unit.
But booms online buying sent the results of the FedEx earthquake unit.
In the last fourth year, the agricultural accommodation increased about 29 per cent, but the exploitation was basically the same because of the higher prices for larger packages and its own ensuring.
The expression unit recorded a higher accommodation because of the higher basic assessment, while the smoking increased in the cost market because of higher prices for work force.
In the preliminary negotiation about an hour before the opening of FedEx shared $3.85, or $2.5 per cent, $150.15.
They finished 11 per cent in the year and 17 per cent under the record of June 11.
At its unexpected meeting for the whole year, the federal reserve lawyers will observe this week two days used at 27 feet of the Spanish Mahagon table and will decide whether the time has increased the key stage.
In the end of the central bank ornament of them, the two-path seats room will be a smooth room of the United States.
The map is noted that the President Fed Janet L. Yelen and her colleagues have an economic interest in the nation over all the others.
The Central Bank has two challenges from the Congress: maximize American employment and maintain more stabil prices.
But from the Great Research of the Federal Research, the Federal Representatives recognised that there are non-scrited third functional periods: financial stability.
And this third functional period may be a X-factor in too close to the provisional decision to be announced in the fourth, whether the American economy is prepared to be launched in the case of the unprecedented stimulation in the form of at least nul-code rate rates at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows solid growth of economics, recent turbulences on world financial markets might have been aware of the Fed to fear because of the adding to the uncertainty that increases its reference funds - and it is nothing more than the fourth percentage point.
"It is obviously that the market of work and inflation will be the most important thing to look at," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economy of the macler company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they only looked for a close to the unhankment of the peace, a higher insight of the global market has already given them enough reasons for waiting forward," she said.
There is no consensus about what Fed will do, and the same thing is the cause of nervousness on financial markets.
At least half of the economics recently asked by Blomberg's companies has prevented the increase of the costs of this week.
Financial markets, however, expect that Fed will hold the matter, with the key indicator only at least 30% of the opportunity to increase.
This would be shown on the ground of the action market in the case Fed increases the taxes, only if the policy is increasingly avoided by the promise that further increase is invisible.
In an increasing industrieal average, Down Jones spread over 228,89 points, or 1,4%, at 16 599,85.
The meeting was started expecting Fed's policy to keep a challenge this week, named John London, the main economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprised if Fed had now taken the sats," says he.
If Fed's policies would do that, "they should go to the country in their programme declaration and keep in the hands of financial markets to not proceed to panic."
Other experts said that the increase of saseb would be quiet because it would be removed of the immorality from how Fed would go.
Only a month ago, Fed seemed to be on a good way to increase the rate of 0,25 per cent in this month, the first small step in the short-term measure conditions that would confirm the strength of economic living in the United States.
She said that over the year and the beginning of the year, she expects to increase the sazeb in the air year and through the stress of the liberals that they need more economic progress.
Although the creation of workplaces in August was disappeared, the market of the work in this year described solid growth.
The rate of unemployment has achieved to 5,1% in the previous month, which is less than seven years and is near the level Fed considers full employment.
The muscles showed the signs of the introduction.
And even though inflation continues to run under 2% of the central bank, Fed policy says that the main cause was a significant low-price effect.
Economic "with able to equippe with higher samples and needs them, with regard to the lowness of the work market," Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets throughout the world began to reject the end of the past month after China devoted its change.
The industry average of the Down Jones society was raised up to 16% under its record value in May when the investors feared that the Chinese economy would be reduced under global growth.
Trh has been declined in this month and Do is now lost only at least 10% of the max.
Political actions to the Fed's political actors adds a complex calculation when the increase of rate rates.
"In the absence of what happened on financial markets, and reports about the difficulty of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, it would be achieved in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the researcher of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and the former officer Fed.
Now he predicts that they wait at least a month to get better control over the results.
"There's a lot of non-profits about what impact it's going to be on the United States' economy, and they have almost no data that could be considered about the most recent development in China," said Oliner.
The health status of global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fedo, so technically it should not be taken into their decision.
But in fact, Fed became a different authority of the whole world.
The impact of the central banks in the last years was great.
The name of the President Bena S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "prosecute" their monetary expansion on the market, started crying throughout the world.
In the world where markets and economys are still connected, they may expect the Fed's representatives to monitor the development, but they also agree with other central bankers and experts to read better the status of global economy.
Their decision process is "creasing knowledge than science," said Zachary Karabell, leader of the global ability-management of the Envestnet Inc company.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Banks in Richmond, Va., announced this month that "Fed has historic movement on financial markets that appear incompatible with economic funds."
Lacker, voting members of the establishment of the Federal Committee for the open market that pressed the increase of sazeb, quoted the decision in 1998-99 as example.
Financial crisis in Asia led Fed to reduce its reference rates of 0,75 per cent point during three meetings "I over limited identifiable impacts on the growth in the United States," said Lacker.
For a year later, the representatives of the Fedo turned these scars.
Fed should be concerned about the financial stability only during a large crisis, as a market exploitation in 2008, said Adam Posen S., the former member of the Committee establishing a staff in Bank of England.
The most recent weight doesn't approach this level.
"You don't want to be in the situation of fear of sazeb growth because the markets were resolved," said Posen, President of the Institute for the International Economy Peterson.
The law on the Federal Reserve System has two mandates and doesn't change financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the skin.

The speed of the travels will stay at the old.
The speed for 150 km/h of Snimovna refused.
In the selected ranges, there will be no higher speed to 150 km/h.
In the absence, Snimovna decided when she came to the amendment proposal of the Senat, which refused to increase the speed.
The new law on earthly communications will now be denied to the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said that the law allows the rate of 10 kilometers.
In contrast of increase, the Minister of Transport of Dan Økok (in ANO) was also established, according to which the Chess Downing Network is not yet established at such speed.
The shipping in the bottom before the messenger supported the senator version of the law.
The approved note is now allowed in accordance with the original government proposal to increase the speed of 90 to 110 kilometers in hours of the first class, especially four-products.
First, this option also extended to the remote range, which would be so able to run in the selected speeds to 150 km/h, but the Senat refused it.
The messengers now came to his proposal.
The Senators, with the agreement of the Ministry of Transport of the News, also took the right to the transport policy to have the last word in the establishment of local communications on which they are concerned.
The senate version that Snimovna approved is also calculated to save the channel, water or public light boxes in particular under the board of the vehicle.
They'd be so surprised for the sale of the grounds.
There should also be no obligation to be carried out by the local routes without regarding the owner of the relevant ground.
The News also needs to help improve the protection of the motor and facilitate the remote packing with the remote vehicles that the manager does not report.
The new vessels could be sold from a separate vehicle, which is in six months after the notification of their masters are not accused.
The citizens will have the possibility to exclude tranzit cost transport through their fields through others and third classes under the threat of expenses and for the delivery company.
The new is also the possibility of carrying electronic daily tags in place of testing papers that will be used even after 1 January of the next year.
According to the government, it will take the money for the implementation of the electronic system.
The expressioner is before the court.
For the prejudiced blessing of the citizens, he's ten years worse.
The case is concerned with the details of the proposed project of welcome to the citizens.
In this time, the police wanted to shoot and the posters of Zuzona Kailo (CHSSD), but the Poland's dream didn't leave her.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both to ten years of prison are worse.
The main treatment is planned for two age days.
According to the State Deputy Mandick with Maceca, at least one million corners were cutting out of the affliction.
The slave's will be struggled about a famous condemnation.
The members of the town leadership under the claim of their functions were unrighteously allowed to obtain the powerful benefits of the companies that organized the welcome of the citizens.
Mandicting, in accordance with the requirement of the director of the Governing Board of City Services, Education and Cultural, he urged to ensure in the election management of five proposed firms.
When she arrived to the conference, another company offered the lower price, the cohesion was interrupted.
Then the law had to have a city to check the officer, and it was only the Darothore company, which then advised the advice of the town.
The city has finished at least million more.
Both commitments were led to ensure that the Darothore company provides public provisions to order the welcome of the citizens in the Labo Length and coordinated at least with the requirement of the procedure with a strategy, the State defence.
Currently, it was aware that Darothore company, on the end of this provision, considers the Court on the Lab's implementation of the Benefitance of the Price Action, which will reverse the real value of the services provided, is immediately higher.
Three years of society, according to the writer of the project, was insected over five million corners.
Finally, the city was only one of the parts, a range of 1,7 million corners, and then departed from the contract.
The payment of the payment was at least represented by a million crown.
The mandic has already rejected any law dismissibility.
I didn't make any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this constructed case, he said the ancient primator, with that the city was only called to a draft project from the past years.
In 2008 to 2010, the Agency Roxy II was ensuring.
"It was for the same conditions, for the same money," added Mandick.
Criminalists wanted originally to condemn Cailo’s messengers, who also was a member of the city.
The messenger's dreamed her, but she didn't take her to smoke.
Criminalists therefore have deposited in her case, but they counted Kailo's accusation after that she ends a post-mandate.
The welcome of the citizens was a society action that had been accomplished several times for year.
The mothers had 50,000 corners in her buying children's needs and detailed gifts.
The Hungarian politicists stealed up on a dog's wheel.
Then the newspapers gave them to delete the record.
The Hungarian police's headquarters with Serbskem shortly arrested the AP Agency camera and needed him to remove the record where the police dog was driving up to the ground.
Hungarian government, but this accusation is understood.
An incident occurred on the Sunday evening when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants, who were over the field of cookers in the town of Hungary, Russian City, override the border with Serbskem.
In the contrary of the officers, the polices were cut off, and one of them left to a certain Syrian to smoke the dog with a cock on a cock.
A man who cried, "Let me, please, I'm a thief," he cried, saying, "I'm a muzzle."
The museum films everything, one of the police, and he didn't allow him to leave.
Then the newspaper had no longer to phone his officers or colleagues in the place.
Policists brought the Musician to a dark place at the registration center for the shipping and asked him to show them what he was offered.
Then they ordered him to remove the record.
This was the result of the two-day work in Serbsk and Hungary.
She says he feels in danger because they were near the dogs.
The AP Agency sent a protest letter to the speaker of the Hungarian Government of Zoltan Kovács.
Political behaviour has marked as an inacceptable and indicated that newspapers should have the possibility to extend events and not risk physical violence and should not be afraid that the government will destroy legally achieved materials.
The challenges with the revocation of the police report of the Museo's treatment of events.
He said that the police just wanted to show them the newspaper if they were in some cases that they had the right to do.
When they found that they weren't there, they didn't use anything to get him.
"The dogs can smile - they are smiled to be scared and a little scared, but they're not sure to smile," says Kwacs.
Invisible Liga of Masters.
City's expenditure is cutting us, believes Juventus
"I don't think we've had to play it," shocked Manuel Pellegrini's head, a kitchen of the home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classical witch of Lig's masters.
No team has created a lot of opportunity, but we had a smoke on the shoes we had a long time.
"The cause of the race wasn't in the taktic, Juventus just shoot two beautiful balls," assessed Pellegrini's excuse, whose team incasted in a consistent excuse after 636 minutes.
The finalist of the past session of Juventus was in the case of a range exactly separately - after the first three rows of the Italian lines, the title only has a point and the score 2:4 is located at the 16th place of the table.
And that's why it was a great surprise to Etihad Stadium.
"This expenditure will help us psychically, we'll be smoking," believes the trainer Massimiliano Allegri, who had to be lost three opery - Pirla, Teveze and Vidala.
In Manchester, Pogba, Mandžukič, and Morat.
"It's true, this victory is very important, even if we're going to find him on a victory flight," hopes Morata.
Because when we're on it, we're going to get together between the best manship in Europe.
In the second half time, we were better, mostly in the avoid phase.
This result is my player.
"Before our equipment goal, we could even insect at 0:2, but Gianluigi has holded us," he blessed the Allgri Golf Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances," Yayu Tour, the City officer.
We need to get out of Ligy's experience masters and try better results.
Bye Angelo, old Germany II.
Before we continue to ask the imigrants, we should know that the whole medical training around is raised by professionals.
According to the needs of medicine and also to the season.
And then let's stop a minute.
Today, the news and the media are full of children who are not on their parents' hands on the deep exode paths.
And it calls out in humans -- so in the European man -- automatic feelings of sin and consciousness.
Well, they're not just coming here with the low kids, take care of the coming members to the Greek Islands that the kids are not so much to see them!
Well, sometimes, we were lost from the television of the ships ships on Lampedus, who escaped from the French border in Menton, where the beautiful promenades are able to lie thousands of young men.
From the big part of the young blacks.
And they also lost the pictures from Callais, where these men eat and black men are waiting for them to find a tunnel under La Manche.
Maybe it doesn't happen anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian coast of Eritreys have never made a special house for the inhabitants of Europe.
It's a lot of falseness.
So when it's about a quote for escape, it's sometimes surprised that it's not just about the worst kids of Syria, but also about the shipped - for elders: modeally discovered - young men.
Their muscultures look like they're just out of some fit center.
It's just one personal experience.
In the year on Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus, we lived on the private hotel.
Unless it was private, she came to the plane of a large group of cars.
But there's no chance.
And the young ones went out of them.
Maybe 30 men and five women.
Agreement between 15 and 30 years.
They went into the planet, all the clothes in the marking clothes and the boat, in the hands, otherwise, smartphones.
It's about a private plane, it's not busy and employees - Turkey, Muslims! - they're clearly afraid of them.
They've got all the beds.
He who didn't laughed on him and was just in the sea had a suffering.
They were cutting like a American rapper film.
On the heads of hair with white and colored addictions on the feet.
Then they stole the local plane bar and started fixing.
They stayed around the tables, they came near the seats and the white hosts of bar - read Muslims and Europe, and they would not ask.
Mothers with kids smoothed out of food treasures somewhere to rest.
The neighborhoods drink a drink like a third - how in the United States series? - on the board they've got an empty ball around themselves.
They're still calling one to another.
However, the English wasn't.
Then they gave them a drink of wine, like a lake.
They went to the hotel bathroom - in mark balls, especially those young ladies - in the water dressed and cried, mothers with children and managers fled hardly and half hours were not already on the plane or in the bathroom nor one of the unleavened hosts.
They're all lost.
I don't care whether someone was Christian or Muslim.
The hotel's employees were afraid of them and just talking about them.
"Have you seen the gold that they had?"
"Yes," I said.
"Now, they didn't have it decisive of the work," said the chief.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had a massive gold string around.
And one had likely twenty-third massive cross of gold.
And women were like goldenness.
"They're drugs?" I asked.
"You've seen how they want," he answered.
The travels don't shoot or don't live.
They're just a lot of other thing.
So I've already been clear what they've passed.
Of course in June 2105, it wasn't so important for me.
I didn't know what to follow.
But secret services and policies had to know it first.
I don't think they don't know.
At that time, 1,5 million immigrants have been exposed to Europe.
They're going and go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that the total political policy, like intellectual and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and his policy - today publicly recognized the main force in Europe - lie, lie, and lies - but not only they, both the EU and the TV, including ours.
For example, recent TV images on the extent welcome in Germany are at the level of the Moscow TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were some soldiers, but mostly - ancient - Muslims welcomed their partners.
For a long week, the reports on the Czech television were broken, as well as in some research, Germany almost all of them for the arrival of emigrants.
Of course, who was just a few days in Germany, he knows that it's lying like a wheel.
It confirms further information.
For example, a honourable investigation of the public measures organized by ARD - Chess Association of Public Television Society of Germany.
According to the ARD statement, there was more than 50% of Germans to accept more surroundings for a week ago.
That's also our television.
However, the second day was held in Germany: in ancient vote to the article, 94.5 per cent of German immigrants had no longer wanted -- ankets participated in 67 000 people.
It is true that Mercel's office publicly in November 2010, so five years ago, she said, "Our effort on `multi-cult' has been completely mistaken."
Then she said, "Nemecko is going to fight multicultural society."
"All trials of such use have been missing."
In the country where four million Muslims lived, there was no strategie that allowed people of various cultural environments to live near themselves and not integrate themselves.
But it's not real.
Multicultural access when we say we just live happy near ourselves, this access failed.
Exactly failed.
But the Mercel seems not to be forced against the powerful German and Europe and mainly against the political correction.
This shows the scale of events.
The conflict is quickly increased.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, an Agency for the SPD, the only one who has not in the European Parliament and does not have any marriage - yes, this is the one of Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play a supervisory in the center - as he has already been introduced for a longer time.
It seems to be particularly under the last German policy expressions that Germany has passed over Rubikon.
We assume that, while the majority of European policies are not supporting these terms, the Staters of the countries who were victims of the Nazismo are amazed.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Whose years were trying, at least, to build their horrible age of aggressors and murder millions?
They have the truth those who say that in Germany's soul the devil is raising aggressive, overseer and violence?
Has the right officer Otto van Bismarck, when all his powers stopped the temptations of the Grandmen on the control of the whole Medium of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea destroyed?
Maybe he had.
When they stopped her, she started preparing for the First World War.
The thought of Velkonymeck, which brought German and Europe into two wars that remained millions of lives, probably returned in another way.
After trying to control the marxists, for example, with Rote Armee Fraction, and after the success of NDR, it was in Germany based on the economy, which was in the middle of one of the main ideal sciences, started developing a new German ideology.
We'll say the sun.
The German elections had been long-term relationship with the German nationalism, so they left all those fighters against the atom, especially looking for a paradise for all, the tissue supported the old Caesar and national password of the forests must live.
In order to be satisfied with the unclean young people who want to do something different and better in the world, fully attracted to the side of fighters against the planet exploitation, stop nuclear electricity, etc.
And they forgot that in this production there is also strong antisemitical - suchly propalestinical - and antislovanic proud that considers all the Slovakians as a difficult verse - already since Karla Marx, who, after parents of the Jewish, was mainly a German nationalist.
And as they show the last states of Schulze and German minimums openly disappeared to non-comprehensive East States, the idea of the Leader Germany.
He needs to listen to him without forgiveness.
Another wow to you!
And when we recall that immigrants are a very influenced group of volunteers, we have what we have.
And then they are always as a capital, especially German, whose education, and which is the fact that Germany actually through the banks and the Union controls most of the European States.
The Saturday Pseudofire first brought German into the ecologist and multicultural bathroom, and he brought them home today and brings even millions of Muslims.
Those who, crying the sounds of Siren, will immediately plot on the wall of reality which the Mercel doesn't want to see, and they'll start smoking.
Germany can only be raised back to his neighbors with strength, again a part of his citizens - but as it seems, still a smaller part - ideologically discovered, but finally it is realized as always achieved.
Will German go again?
The Muslim's residents are already gone.
What will the German government do when the public protests of Germans will be made against the Islamists?
Who will help the Muslims who live long in Germany, but are no asyluming to overcome local standards and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalising muslims, foreign islamists and Germans are looking for the fear of Islamism of their country?
What will this do to Germany, and in general to Germany, when people will be taken to vote and publicly protest against the new muslim euro?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has been called in Europe to support the solar ideology, so the elitarian ideology and the principle of totality, and its unnacial banks, growth.
And because of an imperfect act against the unbelieving Democratic Germans and all of the unbelievers of Eastern Seasons, it will not be able to be able to do well.
Finishing tomorrow.
The best way to rescue the winds: to get them to death.
It's enough to shoot, and the weapon has fallen on you in a way that weakers do not just have to stop.
He's living head of you a good sister, and he's leaving, and he's leaving the way he's leaving (or he's almost driving) for the sale and the living sock.
Maybe it's a threat that the speaker has fallen into the reality.
And we'd like to have a lot of trials and smokes.

The Brazilian Pediatric Company Rio Grande propagates a healthy diet at the cow
The Brazilian Pediatric Company of SPRS has come in a amazing way to focus on women's knowledge about the significance of good pains by cutting by the images of children who are in the mixed piece of a healthy food.
The human mother milk is based on various proteins, tubes, vitamins and carbohydrates that add to the horses all animals needed to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to transmit energy requirements is recommended to increase the daily calorial accommodation of 500 calories daily.
However, new researchs indicate that the increased gain of calorie is not the only diet measures that the mother should be guided.
The recent study of Robert Waterland, Professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, discovered that healthy diets of women in fact affected the genetic creation of their children and protected them from the development of inhabitants.
Infelicity also confirmed that the healthy diets have negatively affected the infant immunity system.
Seven's Sunrise domains a sazba, although Nine's trys to supervise the guidance in Today Show
Carla Stefanovice and Lisy Wilkinson to Canberry because of covering the costs of the liberal lead was not able to create sufficient increase for Today.
Morning show Nine promised from the national capital after Malcolm Turnball Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with the hostial David Kochm and Samantha Armytage was held in London as a part of a long week of the international television shipment, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagarish water and Cancun.

Today recorded less increase in its assessment in comparison with the lunch (317 000) and the last weight (283 000), but their number was at the last fourth (343 000).
Today in the last months is fulfilling the space on Sunrise.
In August, 318,000 were 330,000 in Today in comparison with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the space was moved between 40 000 and 50 000.
On September Sunrise has 349,000 divaries and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all the morning.
The changes affect this morning more than only Parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are good, thanks for the opposition!

Three in the Final agrees that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who's going to choose?
Is the secret reached?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not want to find who won Bachelor.
The woman with Sam Wood comes to Bachelor, has been able to have an unprofitable secret.
And the three girls who remain will not be sure who is the right that will finally get rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows before they left only two, they told us who won.
Sam Wood's tongue to the fourth final
All three women of lyrics struck, why Wood is a perfect man, quoted his meaning for humor, ambitious, family values and position as reasons why they want to be his partner.
Everyone in the question, "If it would not, what would be the final flower of Wood?", they could work as a partner about the one who gets the heart of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, Markoski called Mackay quickly as this, which would be the best hour to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a easy relationship since that day.
"On the moment I came home and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they are too compatible and I still think it is about the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really a woman, she's very happy with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together and they were the right chemicals between them.
They're good and happy together.
Sarah Mackay thinks he could create a first couple with Sam Wood.
She's the only one who says that during his last visits, she realized that Wood could be "the truth."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I knew that this isn't just a game - I opened him my whole heart now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if she wasn't, she looked awesome.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I have both girls like the same -- it's between Sneezen and Lana.
Bachalor is sent in the middle of 7.30 to that.
Is it originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had some opportunities to start her NFL carrier.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after he was moved to the United States and many teams were asked after his great beginning of the training at the end of the last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and the trainer Jim Tomsula and looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers left Hayne sitting after the rest of the region, because he made a mistake, which did the conversion of Australian rugbian ligs in the first shopping of the surface at the outer winter 20:3 to Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bushe lost.
Tomsula was still honest in the game.

The lawyers in Kathmand voted on the proposal of the provision and the officers that the new chart should be adopted to the week.

For a long-term diabetic diabetics, a useful hurry chirurg may be useful
The expenditure of chirurgs for a deeply spectacular people with diabetes type 2 can continue at least five years, according to new study.
However, it's too soon to say whether the people with diabetes type 2 live long after the chirurg of music than those who are given neururgical treatment.
"Death details remain long to show," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the hurry chirurg that wrote the leader to the new JAMA chirurg study.
Operation for mubling, baratric chirurgs are used to reduce various methods.
The reduction of hunger and human body limits to absorb food.
In years, baratric operations were shown as efficient for diabetes type 2, but most of the research were carried out to people with a morbid obsession with the body index (BMI) of 25 or more.
The BMI measures the relationship of the weight related to the height is considered normally in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
The BMI values 25 or above indicates the respect of persons and people with value of 30 are considered to be considered.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.us.gov/1D0ZqqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the World Health of Min-Sheng in Thai-wan have used data collected from the study since 2007, which includes two types of barriarch chirurg - claimed bypass and gastractomy - in treatment procedures of diabetes 3 in the medical processes of the diabetes.
The average BMI between the operators of the operators was fulfilled according to the study from 31 to 24,5 to the end of their fifth year.
In the meantime, BMI remained those who were not provided by the chirurgy treatment of diabetes, the range of the same value as 29.
A diabetes was totally resolved between patients with operations in 36% and partly in 28 cases.
The test group was completely resolved at 1 per cent and partly at about 2 per cent of patients.
Next was the control of blood pressure, trigylcerides and "false" LDL cholesterol described "actually better in the chirurg group," they found the cars.
The researchers also monitored the patient with a level of hemoglobin A1c in blood that reverses the transitional disease of blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is the best to maintain 7 per cent, the investigators.
After the operation, the average value of the A1c hemoglobin from at least 9 per cent of 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at almost 8 per cent in the medicine.
But this better "glymical control" - which is turned into the better levels of the A1c hemoglobine - has not reduced death in five years, according to the main researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operation.
After the fifth year, a group with bypass was lost more sustainable in comparison with the gastronomy group (18,7 against 14,2 kg), received large BMI polars (7,4 against 5,1) and the hemoglobine A1c (3,1 per cent against 2,1 per cent) and had more probability of diabetes (46,9 per cent against 16,7 per cent).
While a new study does not show the improvement of survival or chirurg after five years, there is evidence of stronger people in Sweden, where they discovered that the chirurg leads to life, says Blackstone from University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to Swedish studies, there were nearly 29% more opportunities to survive in the next 15 years, compared to the group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not improved in the survival between patients after surgery, Blackstone is a quiet result for people with BMI under 35 who have interested in these procedures.
"It's a critical work, because it says that it's more safe surgery in the group with lower BMI," without increased risks of death or disease.
Blackstone also says that people and their doctors should really be able to take the weight of the patient BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting for too long with that we're giving people the most difficulty of the situation," says.
I think that when you meet these genetic changes that are strictly promising their body with obsession and sugar, the path is really hard.
"It is impossible to all come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to take all the surfaces, led Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution of the current urchlical crisis is at the nearest east.
The Tibetian Manager of Buddhists called to end violence in household countries.

He also showed that the responsibility of the west European countries had already been amazing, in this situation was inadequate.
"It is impossible to all come to Europe," he said in his words.
Although Dalai Lama rejoiced to German and Rakous in the crisis solution, he remarked that it was just a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful about some thousands of surroundings, but you'll have to think about the long-term solution, how to bring real peace and real development, especially through education of these Muslim countries."
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce murder in their countries.
We have to limit the use of power.
The use of power has never resolved these problems," added.
When the question of violence was resolved, Dalai Lama also declared excuses on George Bushe after 9/11 terrorist attacks and says that "the uncontrolled reaction of the United States has chosen a string of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I declared a fair conscience in the letter of President Bush and advised him that the way to resolve this problem was not a violent way.
I know that his motives were good, but he used the strength and created unexpected results," he said.
Four-proportional increase in the number of children consumed the health action for the last 4 years
The toxicological center around the United States reported at least 400 per cent of growth from 2010 in the number of children to 12 years, which were high-alcohol health action, according to the toxicological center in Georgia.

"It was very crazy," said CNN Ortoria Scott, the mother of Nhaijah.
It could be dead for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcohol products or to organize healthy media from children.

The police set up the broken plan as "inocaust pressure" and refered to the school fourth,

De Boer, who is currently Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, it's not the best of the Celtic ships, and why?"

I know that it's very frustrating and many people are real, really increasing or increasing.
We're totally the same, but we have to go.

Now it's very important to stay at yourself.

Scotland independence remains unchanged while the entire independence of the U.S.
NEWSTER in Scotland remains unchanged by 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of non-employed in the U.S.A. is achieved to $10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
5,9 per cent of the Scope Independence was achieved in the United States (5,5 per cent), as indicated from the Office for National Statistics (UNS).

Why was I a witness of transport in Oklahoma?
After this day, on the latter legal intervention, I will follow the death of a man.
If it happens, and I hope that it's not possible, I'll sit in the watching gallery at the death of the Oklahoma State prison and see Richard Glossip, which will be prepared for death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who will be witnesses of his death.
I first received the invitation in the year through my best friend, and although I had been surprised, I agreed.
As the day is near, I'm starting to be afraid.
So why do I do that?
I accepted this invitation, because it's a good way I can tell you the whole story about death's crime.
I'd offer this unique perspective.
It is true that newspapers have the permission to monitor transports in America and because often more requirements than free places are conducted by Morbid lottery who will decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of locations for newspapers from 12 to 5.
Whoever will be chosen, it will be monitoring the whole transport inevitable.
I can't do that.
I'll sit on the side of the neighborest friends Richard Glossypa and I've created a special room to him for the months of telephones and one two and half hours of visit.
I like that guy.
We're freaking when we talk together.
The prison officer says that I can't be a witness and a newspaper, so I'm not allowed to have a note block and I'm not able to sign what I'm seeing.
I'll have to remember all the details.
One of the Oklahoma newspapers convinced me on Twitter to compromise my distress.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the shooting as it's going to be disappointed, get access.
I've tried her.
She admitted that "It could make it better," but the same thing she thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him that he could ever remove me from the list of witnesses.
But he wants an international newspaper that will be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help progress against death's punishment.
Kim Bellware, a newspaper from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more information about the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all of the details here again.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after the murder of Barry Van Treese would commit him to a criminal commitment.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent from murder.
I believe that there was no sufficient quantity of evidence to justify death's trespass.
My opinion is bad.
And just from this perspective I'll watch his death.
I can't say I'm really obvious.
To this end, you can turn back to other newspapers.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I like to die for the rest of death.
A man uniformed from Canning River on the police officer.
The Guardian of Canning Vale stayed a little bit after he made a man out of Canning River.
The man of Peter, who was fucking a police, did not find after he arrived into a bad bathroom water only meters from the police, who tried to interpret him to return to the border.
Police from Canning Vale was invited to a accident that moves to Beckenham in the outside.
When they saw the surprise, he tried to save them through Canning River.
But he didn't get far away.
"Start in the water and repeated I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
The Guardian Lachlan Perhavec didn't just wanted to help the uniform, so he tried to use a safe tax and a police exemption."
"It's sometimes trying to do when playing things runs," said Castledine.
Fotbal champion Ben Cousins gives a memory example.
In 2006, Cousins went to the bus and tried to move through Swan River.
His effort was bad, but he inspired the local to start planning by Bena Cousins.
Peter Moody says that the officers tried to spring him and to end the convictions.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's officer that he tried to get a spring, and he felt that he would immediately finish the execution.
He was employed to the officer and the integrity of Racing Victoria and went out of the convince that they had a personal campaign against him with the lady Daddy's lady in keeping the day of destruction, which was the last chair for him in the middle of the middle.
Moody said Fairfax Media, that he always tried to do what is best for guidance and felt in a difficult situation, if Lidarin's positive excuse on cobalt that can't explain.
He turned into the language about an accusation from the Spionage after 18 months and didn't want to look like "wheel threat."
"I didn't want to say anything about that I was sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all out of you alone," said Moody.
They know it's happening.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'll sleep well.
I want to go with his head up and the leaders think I'm max for them.
When they're starting to think about the face, then I shouldn't be a trainer.
I'd have to consider what I'd do to my licence later.
Before Moody raised his conversation for racing.com bomb that the integrity of the division tried to spread.
"For eight months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - which I'll be called after a question - and they offered him a job in my stages for finding information about things that are doing in my stages," said Moody on Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a leader.
If that's true, they should all show their information because they've been trying to take me up.
Robert Roulston, the former President of RVL, David Moodie, the current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current general director of the RVL company, was known in that time, and it was known today.
Do I have to think that's going to happen personally?
Will the RVL increase a couple of collars and make people to take responsibility for what is happening in this industrie?
I'm bad for this industrie?
I'm really so bad for this industry?
Perhaps people think they're right.
Maybe I need to take my license and shoot me away and I don't know what I'm saying now will give them the material to think.
But I came to the point when I don't care about it, and I'm so sorry.
I really missed it.
I'm gonna press them, and I'll move them to make them decisions.
I have my family support and I can leave.
The fladens of frustration trainers increased with a long investigation because of the cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent experiencing in it, he felt that he could "the time of his licence on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the Black Caviar champion, marked the rule of investigation in the day of "smoking" after the horse was applied to the horse of the honey or the bottom, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of guidance.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Somebody of my team's got a bitch on his feet.
It could have last night.
It could happen yesterday and it also happened.
It's happened on the day of breakfast.
Moody raised three months diskvalidation for the treatment of the bags in the day of the shipment, where the officers have already opened the investigation.
It's funny.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has come too far," said Moody.

Trener Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns rivals for wrestling
Craig Bellamy, the trainer Melbourne Storm, criticized the steps of his players as "planning" two NRL favorite primaryship.
Trent Robinson, the trainer Sydney Roosters, said that he decided to allow Storm players to "restle" his player during the confrontation of the Storm team in the Final Qualification in Sydney in the fifth night.
Wayne Bennet, Brisbane Broncos trainer, made easy note on Strorm after his team wind final quality over North Queensland Cowboys on Sunday when he called a game as a "preview" rugby ligby and two of the Queensland were not "best great" to wrestling.
Bellamy struck his player's steps and said they focused on the "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation increased himself because his team is criticized by two leaders, which might mean that they have fear of the Storm team.
"I don't remember that Trent Robinson's talking about wrestling when they shot us 24-2," he said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can admit that we haven't changed anything from our defense system and technical last weeks, we have just put it on the contact during the challenges, and that means to return.
Trent's here three years ago, and she's obviously training a great team, so it's probably not usually to play that could be a little shock for him.
It's funny as such things always come in this year part.
Bellamy denied the idea of Bennett's "unbelieving photoball" and reminded his minder that Bennetov's team of St George-Illawarra Dragons played in 2010 with a "new" photoball.
Wayne's talking about an exciting photoball.
He had the truth in that he was his Sabbath game as a surprising as ours, and he was also the same surprising," Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 because they were a noble team and Wayne said that he was totally one.
But now he's a team who can play the game style that looks like an interrupt, especially his young ones with their speed.
That photoball you would like to play if you should have available this type of players.
This view said in 2010, and now he wants all teams to play his photoball style - but not every team has two books like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so this style can't play.
It makes me more self-conscious because they say such things because they're afraid of a threat against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they arrived to great packs.
Bellamy also showed the reality that Storm and Roosters had fallen more gates than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team was probably good, I didn't see, but what's the cooler? 16-12?
Our game has finished 20-18, was there two other trials in our game, but is it a surprising football?
Or are the interruptions and the disturbing of trials that is interesting?
These are agencies.
If they dismiss us, it means that we're going to meet us in a certain phase again.
Storm has this week-end breaking and have played the right to host north Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the next Sunday evening in AAMI Park. The mails will be sale from the morning of the next attack.
Serbian man received $200,000 USD for drug offence
A man who was able to live for 40 kilograms of cocaïne, who was exposed from Queensland, received $2000,000 USD.
Marko Maxmovic (29 years) was one of the five men who arrested the federal police last month with 100 kilograms of drugs from Solay jacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomer.
Maxmovic was watched at the meeting together in the office at the late time and later met them in the Coomer Roadhouse chamber, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although he made the potential reason to live for the property of cocaïne commercial quality, the lawyer Maximovice set a restriction on that there is no evidence that he would own all the entire quantity and that he could be in the case of a entirely entirely and innocent.
The Supreme Court of Peter Flanagan thought that Maxmovic would overchch.
He's clear to Serbsko.
She's often going to Serbska," he said in the middle of the court.
In the corner case, the police lie about where he lives.
Mother and the independent father of the Maxmovies joined $200,000 USD for his release.
"After reading the obligatory statement of both persons, it is obvious that the inserted cart of $200 000 USD is a real financial rate for them," announced the judge Flanagan.
Their efforts were clearly unreasonable because the accused was not yet in the court, he warned.
Maximovico has been made a pack under the condition that it is like a Australian, such as a Sarb Pass, the day will be reported to the police and will keep the command of exit from 18 hours to 6:00 tomorrow.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to find pedofiles to send images
Pedofil used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of children's disturbation.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping, then she contacted her on her online chat, where she had a lot of unreasoned children who sent him another user.
The girl then went out and discovered she had a phone and then found him in the hand of Hogga's bed.
She came to him, and before she warned her mother, she found a worried message.
The police came in and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and found a "incomfortable" search on the web with the use of expressions to search for unrealable children's images.
Afterward, Hogg said to the cops that his reason was "coming pedophiles" on the Internet before he'd "predicted that he was a police officer and feared them."
Fishing leader Eiley Robertson led to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it's a consciousness - that it's aware of the loss of people.
He recognized that he was searching on the computer, but he said he just wanted to imagine that he was a policeman to scare pedofiles.
He was investigated on his conversion with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
He did it because he's getting it.
He says he's locked up in the worm and said he wants to see images of destruction and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found a message on her phone, he called her mother, thrown and wept.
She saw an immortal images on her phone and was invited to be confronted later.
The girl was listening and talked about how the invitation used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed younger than he.
Hog, 23, a resident in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted an accusation for accepting or offering inadequate images of children on July 14th, delayed the conditions of the 25th January and did not have to listen to the Court of 24 March this year.
The advocate of the restrictions of Gregor Sim asked Hogg not placed in the list of sexual delicts, because he could argument that in his action was not "no basic sexual subtext".
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deposited the judgment on governance because of the report of social workers.
Hogg was made in this case, but it was maintained before hearing the other unresolved cases.
He was located on the list of sexual delicts before the date of his judgment.
The Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has presented a bad statement in the Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, before this year fell on the streets of leaders to the ground.
He wasn't lost, but his video was a viral in social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also encouraging by the proposals of the opposition lawyers that they received anonymous expenditure of killing that were warned before the receipt of Mr Mugabe during his statement.
The past month they received him, and in his statement on the state of the nation in the Parliament, which is the word that he repeated in the outer.
The Chairman of the Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies received text reports on their mobile phones with warning that they should not describe Mr Mugabe.
"The report comes from a number that doesn't appear, but it is called 'drt'," he shared journalists after Mr. Mugabe.
He warns the relevant members to know that the immunity ends in the Parliament and however it comes from the Parliament, their Parliament's immunity does not work.
The officer said that the side that Morgan Tsvangirai leads, has the "footies" in respect of the messengers.

Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says that the partner must be destroyed by Jack Wilshare before the Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also suggested for Wilshere that it's still in the week and if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, it's not the reason that he's not going to play again about the vaccins.
This best scenario has already meaning that Wilshire is sure to meet at least four other English games and, in view of his history, its introduction to the next annual European mystery is obviously not.
The bigger threat of this new problem is that Wilshire ended the last section strong after the chair of the chat and then reached the old form during the presidency.
"This kind of destruction doesn't cause the carrier," says Wenger.
It's a morning that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his chats, nor the shame that he had suffered before.
This could be from a clean medical view of truth, because Wenger recognised that there are relative dangers of other disasters when any player returns during the sezon.
It's also a famous model here.
Premier Injuries Ltd. investigation reports 23 different disorders of Wilshera since six years ago he had his debut.
During the last five years, Arsenal was played only in 65 lines of Arsenal from the total number of 157:
From the larger perspective for Arsenal, it means that six of eight sezons since 2007-08 was one of the two Premier League clubs, who lost the latest day for the cause of destruction.
Wenger accepts the potential of the loaded crowd, but Arsenal believes that the improvement in the field of the range of ransoms in the last session will continue.
"In times when you come back after disappointment, you have a worried time, time when you need to send your body and get a consciousness," says Wenger.
Jack's too young to get out of that.
I hope he's stabilising his body, I'm sure he's gonna have a carrier he's served.
Arsenal starts a campaign in Liza Shampions on the middle night against the Dino Zagreb Shopping with Chelsea on the Sabbath and Tottenham Hotspur is ready to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey needed to Croatia, that means that Matthew Debuchy and Artta might be able to get up.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Girud in Nano Monreal Theo Walcotta.
"I'm trying to keep the equation and let the players who need it up," says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to the progress of the F group, Maxmir in Zagreb has a message of the most scared station in Europe.
The dinamies were also not increasingly 41 steps after the last section had maintained the campaign "incompatible".
The Station on the Middle-night has explored the agricultural 3.2 degrees.
That was this year in Zagreb.
Winger thinks that Arsenal was learned from the last Season of Ligy Shampions when he had captured against Monah and remained a lot of hope that he would bring a club to the first winning in the European town.
"This is great," said Wenger.
The Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I must be realistic.
We're ambitional, but we're not shadows.
FriendsFest: society show that gives us serious advice of a man's friendship
Absence of similar views in various shows is in the eye of the eye, especially in view of how men need to open more sustainable than ever, what is involved in the murder between young men to 15 years.
In 2013, the only biggest cause of death in men in 20-45 years in the United Kingdom and remains three times more frequently in men than women.
In order to resolve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Man, which is to realize the culture that the men are to look for help in the case of the need.
In the heart of this battle, the friendship is in the heart of this call.
The recent study of more than 2000 Mediterranean students showing depression signs found that, in the case of the depression, the friends had a sufficient high percent of the "Health Research", their opportunity to repeat.
In the same way, for those who are not in depression represents the crowd of the heartly healthy friends of half the opportunity to make spirit problems.
But to work friendship, of course, it must first be appropriate.
In this communication through social media with a style and not on the content of the communication, the timely response is often subject to the comprehensive contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we needed to seem stronger, more loved and successful, even though we actually have a lot of isolation.
This higher success is controlled by what psychologists call for external values; money, image, social status, all on our real values - our personal tough after growth and friendship - which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as he recently explained one billioner and the creator of her, the money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beautiful series of friends was the source of this thought for him.
No one has been defined by his work, but their personalities that have been made through friendly interactions.
Joey Humor and Chandler's old victims, a minute of monitoring the photoball on the agreed Christians, the Ross Town after Rachel, all the prayers of knowing that yes, men can also interfere with it, even though most of them leave their feelings for themselves.
As one of the Samaritan workers explained to me, "My role of auditors who feel in depression or have their own murders has really confirmed that those less friendly interactions can also have a difference."
People who contact us are often feeling unable to communicate with friends.
The old dream is strong in the meaning that it will be considered as hard to open problems.
Friends are one of the orders that will rise to me in memory when I'm trying to offer a longer equipment mechanism.
He's increasing a little moment in a man's friendship.
What is about my task, the outside status on the phone helps people in a moment of disappointment, but the long-term support must come from the greatest nearby, from the network of friends and families.
So, if you take this week on the FredsFest ordered Comdy Central Station, why don't you get your friends on the bed in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely transformed to the opportunity of honourable opportunities.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile on him and heal him.
You don't know what difference your friendship can do.
Serial Friends will be sent to the Comdy Central Station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Mary smiled and helped PSG smith Malmo side
Angel Di Maria serves with Blais Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after shooting branches against Malma.
Angel Di Maria shocked in his debt in the Lize of the Masters and so helped PSG in an urgent smoking Swedish team Malmo.
Here's a report about the pack and reaction on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were both caught in the outer ship and Paris Saint-Germain started their way in Liza Master's final comfortable victory 2-0 against Malma on the park of Princess.
Di Mary shoot the gate less than four minutes after his debt in Lize Masters and this PSG player sent French champions for a victory, but afterward, they stopped a few chances until they finally increased their shoes when Cavani shot the door of the head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in the A group, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they are not only measured for qualification in the explosion cols, but to improve their ways to fourth-final, which were mentioned in each of the previous three years.
But even when they got three points, it was not a classical exchange of the Laurenta Blanca team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic before the door was marnotized and later was issued against his home team and club, in which he began his carrier in 1999.
"In the Master's Lisa is not easy to play out or home, so the 2-0 expenditure makes our adversaries problems and looks like a good beginning, even if there are things we need to improve with the session procedure," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two gates more.
Ibrahimovic turned back after the painting as one of the three changes of the PSG team who was home to build this week of restrictions 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but in fourth minute, Di Mario.
The Argentina steel was marked as a man who moved PSG in Europe to a new level after a transition from Manchester United, who passed the past month, and showed why when he came on the Passover Mark Verratti for the Protection of Malma and a beautiful end he sent a sword for Johan Wilanda to a remote road.
However, if someone expected to start the greatest PSG winning, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who struck Celtic in play-off and arrived in this phase, came with 9 international in the base set and five investors and two attached books were a hard support.
But except the shoes of Nikola Djurgyce, which was just a lot of remote roof of Kevin Trappa in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead of this, the PSG had been raised about benefits from the attack of evil games and the mixed end that was not good nor from Abraham, who couldn't shoot five times in the first half, and then he was disappointed because his shooting came to the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed much more appropriate when he came to prepare a chance for his colleagues and it was just from his games when Di Maria sent a stick shot that ended in Wilando's bracelet for 52 minutes.
The second gol finally came after the time of the game of Cavani, this Uruguayec sent to the head for the sixth eggs of this meeting after Ibrahimovic gathered him by playing from the left hair from Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts of Malma about the possibility that they could be able to achieve something from the safe, and only the exciting rate of Wilanda from the great nearest hope of David Luize and the score remained unchanged and at the moment he was the gleam of Ezequiel Lavezzi's leader at the end of the safe.
The Trener of the Team Malmo Age Hareide admitted that the PSG was about the higher class of his team, Nor said, "Our last game in the Lize Masters was walking in the past year."
Since that time, we just played a Swedish ligue that is not at the same level.
The qualitative shoes are not enough.
The bottom for Paris.
That was a funny shot for them.
Glencore's company sold $2.5 billion for the sale of action
Great Glencore with a seat in Switzerland, who was able to play the price of comody, made $2.5 billion in the middle of $2.5 billion from the sale of action in its expensive plan for reducing the debt.
The Glencore Community reports in its statement that he sold new action in a value of £1.6 billion to pay a deal.
This company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market values, is concerned with the loss of the price of comcoding, because the Chinese economy reduces the demand and ensures safeguards by the market.
The problem was sent in the middle of the price of Glencore action on the top of the London Action Market in a time-time trade.
The actions were cut off 2,77 per cent of 131,60 pences on FTSE 100, opened by 0.69 per cent above.

The Community sold new action in price of 123 pences for action, which was 2,4 per cent low to the lock price in the bottom.
Thus, $1,3 billion of actions in the total price of 9.99 per cent of the group.
With regard to the long-termness of the Chinese growth, the price of yellow rounds was reduced at least half of the carbons, the smokes and other comodities had fallen to 20 to 40%.

Like the surgical crisis spread the schengen space.
The noise lightly burned by Germany was not remote to the European ship, but the ship was already raised to change the curse, writes the French journal Le Figaro.
The European Union has decided to address the problem of migrants and asylum, in particular in Greece, to consider the future separation of the currency based on the quantity that continues to continue reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker requested 25 of 28 EU countries to cross 160 thousand officers, to change the Ministers within the Member States' priority.
Before looking for the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to filter those who are coming today and to resolve the sum of those who are already moved within the Schengen space.
"Effective management of external borders of the EU is necessary to control the migration," refers to the text of the proposed Ministry in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of common measures, the EU shall ensure that it is in danger in its next large integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but he doesn't lose his decision and increases the pressure.
Refreshs the border controls, especially with Rakouskem, but without blocking those who are looking for asylum in this country.
The central power is clearly clear that without it there is no free move in Europe.
As a evidence, it has already been attached to these measures in the lunch, Rakous and Slovakia.
Poland, Netherlands, Belgium and even France also think about it, even though it is different.
Hungary has been a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are applicable in accordance with Schengen rules.
It's about the domain effect, but it's blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of the required input controls in Greece, South Italy and Hungary for those already entered into the country.

Budapest refuses to introduce any input point on its field because they fear more than others that the campaigns should not stay on their boards.
The real black kid remains Greek.
At his islands near the Turkish border, more than 200 thousand people in the air year, which are two times more than the last time in Italy.
Most of them are real demands of asyl that came right from Syria after they passed through the camps in Libano, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a serious opening.
Athens who are still in financial development and waiting for the new government have put their hands into the cell.
This is the standard point for the Balkan Road and the source of the now common offices for the German office of Angelu Merkelo and the Hungary Premier Viktor Orbana.
The Commission of Juncker promises that to introduce control points will happen before, but no number or date have been taken.
"The calls of Greece are related to the whole Europe," agreed the Ministry of the Union in the Monday to mobilize this border.
It is therefore to address the European Agency for Frontex border control in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece to expand its capacity for the accommodation of asylums and to send a look at the islands.
"The needs will be targeted for financial resources," warns the text submitted to the Ministers to approval.
The rights will have the last word of Athiny.
The question of real European borders was not officially removed, but Europe is close to it.
The new new new situation of eighty years, as soon as the second question of the basic quantities and 160 thousand officers, which have already adopted the Commission and the European Parliament, and which strongly supported Angela Merkel and France President François Holland.
Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland do not still want to hear it.
They think it's a attack on their respectiveness.
The number, no obligation, was stored in the most approved text in the lunch.
But as a political commitment.
Otherwise, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the transparency of 40 thousand cycles in the next two years, on which the agreement has already been achieved in June during the EU's hect summary, is concluded by Le Figaro.

For a clear favorite, but Brag doesn't mean.
I'll make it so we're playing home, so we're not sure strangers.

But there are also possibilities of expansion in the country.
For example, in the separation of the chirurgical divisions, the center of a single day chirurg could be achieved, where the definited concepts would be conducted by the execution of chirurg offices that do not require hospitalization less than 24 hours.
In which specific diseases should work on a single surgeon, it is not clear yet.
