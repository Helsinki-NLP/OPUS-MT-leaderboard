DFB-head Grindel does not see the basis for ozil-comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel is currently not a basis for a return from Mesuit Özil to the national society.
"It's a question that, naturally, depends on that you're going to talk to him, and you also talk to him about why he's so clear as it has been declined in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phransasmaster" of the "image rate".
Instead of the monthly debate on the photos of Ozil with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he describes the return of the 92-fast national player Özil.
"I would like if Mesut Özil continued to play for Germany.
I also went out to a certain time that it would be so," said Grindel.

The DFB head repeated his criticism in Auzil that this is not ready for a conversation with the Bundesstrainer Joachim Lew and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it out of the football so that if "man leaves a man or changes a agreement that you talk to his trainer and I find it bad that this conversation has not been made before."

The shame that has passed through the burn must be discovered, even as the burning dust.
However, he must be considerable, because the owner had many samples in his garden's tent.

Pressibility: Agency Government Protection of the Journalist
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defenced the exhibition of a journalist from the press conference of Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan.
In the Canzleramt, the Turkish journalist in Hamburg was transmitted a T-shirt with the Turkish and German record "Free for Journalists" and went to the first line.
The T-shirt, if it was not the problem, said Seibert the image on the Sunday.
It was about a disagreement of the press conference.
By the action of the journalist, there is a strong disagreement that is not acceptable.
He's noticed to bring a person out to the man.
Seibert said that it was not stopped to demonstrate political attitudes in the press conferences in the contract candidate.
This is absolutely independent of whether it is concerned or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists sit in prison.
Many of them are proposed to be proposed for an appropriate spionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the movement of the Fethullah Gulden.
Turkish leadership is responsible for the successful putch test on 15 July 2016.

Munchen: Florian David Fitz entirely drinks with Ina Müller
So fresh and nicely knowing him often his fans: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The loved shoe player was in Hamburg - and lived a wilderness night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow produced by NDR "Inas night" is known for feedful conversations in the Hamburg Hafenkneipe "Schelfish posts".
Moderatorin Ina Müller steals with their guests at some beasts, wine or also high-procent dreams to lock the voice and languages.
Not a few Promis also drinks for the obligatory mute.
On Friday, there was another consequence of the favorite Talkshow.
This time: The look player Florian David Fitz knows of films like "Man's Master", "Terror - your judgment" or "The Yellowest Day."
The munchner got the flight in the high north, but it wasn't good.
On Saturday he set a selfie - his face is fully smoking, the eyes only two small slides.
The bed-selfie shows a full-smoking Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just a powerful cat.
At his fans he sent some - probably not very serious - recognition that he now won: "Regel one: NIE goes to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the round oxygen, whose ina is half three, let's go away.
The alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of 43 years.
His fans just put a few tips to fight the neighbors.
They steal from instant breasts, fish bottles or - probably on the most significant - head paintables.
Others were just surprised about the view of the normally attacked Kinostars.
As Ina Müller has perceived the neighborhood, it is not known for a long time.
Since she's moderated the TV room at the teach since 2007, the 53-year-year-old seems to be clearly tried...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unrat
The growth in 36 kilometers of long front road in the Red Chemical country in Treysa is very hard to find and fulfill.
Recipes against the grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are unlikely drawn.
Shoes, cigarettes, mull and unrats, desolated rubbers and middle-demonitated shadows - thus presents from the length of the income with a group of seats on the road on the hair-toil in Treysa.
For the proposed object, the front road in the Red Chemical country is more than an increasing view.
The subject of the ADFC location group of Schwalmstad is too longer, as the Council Transport Representative of the Ulrich Department.
The problem has already been discussed in the Council's trade business.
There's no solution.
The proposals rejected from the provision of the seat group until the regular deployment of the deadlines and the cleaning of the areas on the board.
"I think it would be the command of the hour - independent of possible more activities," says the wilderness.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that the subject was also introduced into the local office.
It is not only the mould drivers and inhabitants - the seat group is regularly to celebrate.
It is not only a lot of time to be destroyed when the loads are also destroyed: smokes out of the earth, desolated rubbers, smoothed skins, smoothed seat.
Freedoms had already been discovered, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the speaking troops on the name of the stone.
They're surprising that the rastplace is on the radway in Treysa Treysa track point.
"Before the entire advice, it is here at the Haassee Heasse, clearly the heavy point," confirms the advice of the Council, which is now concerned about the new Council in Zigenhain, which will be opened today.
"Let her lead the same ships, it'll be very poor."
Another idea is a video survey in the hill: "It may make it clearly higher to go to the community.
However, it would like to suggest that a police train will be prevented later.
First, the wilderness wants to develop the haashee eggs.
He needs to handle attractives.
With the frequency of the advice, you may be very satisfied.
Touristic marketing is still built.
Our advice is in comparison to others in Germany," the ADFC members.
As extern critical risk station, the ADFC member Susanne Klipper applies the situation in the streets in Treysa.
There's no shoes on the hair.
In the Royal Transport, it may happen that the railways should wait in the middle of the road between both sides of transport flows," she explains.
This is not a problem for sport vehicles, but even for elders and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Culture Railway: the "Kee of Hiltrop" and the sea
The first call to music contemporary was a success, creative, and in the middle of each other.
"D a song for Hiltrop" says the call of the city teiloffensive Hiltrop, in the "Music Contest for large, small, young and achieved music."
A contest "with eyes winkers in the simpathical hilltruper family", such as Karl Franke formed.
In fact, it was soon a family with each other at the coffee and coffee of the holidays of the culture.
Seven formations occurred from the One-Mann-Band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with Gitarre, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrop Live Albachtener, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colours", three members and three generations of the Trencamp Trencamp and Claus, one of the children's Gardent Lumerland, and finally Rike Weighting and the Conservations.
This Contest, as explained by the citizen Joachim Schmidt, is a newness.
We haven't yet lived in other cities.
What did the texts have been linked?
In the areas the Hiltruper See and the market numbers were especially frequently considered.
Rolf Ihmig cut all in his smelling song to "Kee of Hiltrop".
It was also contempted by the culture office.
Alvin Jasic was always reaching the survival of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke built the short-building outputs with short-interviews with interpreters or indications to their shoes.
So you found Humberg that he really studied chemicals, but now Gitarre also teached.
From the tontchniker Stefan Schemelmann knew France that the latest occurred in Ludwigshafen - on a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed up all hands on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Frank said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was also something special for the favorites of the jury, so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untimed with tontchniker Schemelman.
Other musicists can take a song: Many with his Hiltrop shooter, the France, especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Roudel": "A very beautiful approach" with ten children and two exhibitors in Gitarre and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all, the children also came to final again - and they sounded even without electronic support "rightly well," as France said.
Leaders made the jury of the aspects of the originality, related to Hiltrop, the accommodation of the melodie and recognition values.
The jury is Gisbert Keller from the Westfalen School for music, Andreas Klomface from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the economic connection, and Jan Kaven, President of the city's officer.
The city officer had called the event from the beginning of its ten-year existence in life.
She declared the event as a successful success.
All of them are very satisfied, and "the atmosphere was well" in a very complete cultural room.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the gameest
The gamers make two teams that transmit each other.
For each side there is a view screen in which four cards with key words, which man - the old trick with the red floor - only can get out when you get it in.
So it is ensure that the parent page can't read anything from exhibition.
On the card, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Two windows.
Three.
4 feasts."
These are the signs that apply fortan to encrypt.
Because there's not the signs here, but the Codes.
Replacement of a player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a codecard on which maybe "3.4.2".
The "Decrypto" should not be considered the signs behind the secret field, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "World", "Fest" and "Window" - and so that his own team recognizes the correct order and can't get the generic team, because it wins the party when it goes to him twice to touch the code.
So the encryptor notes and reads it, "Warpen" for the crowd, "Lose" as a fitting, here, of course, would be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has applied in the school and knows the window smooth.
So it's running for the round, the team for the team continues.
You don't know the terms of the parent - but these can be better collected with any indication that the encryptor is there.
Maybe mysterious, but not to decline the receipts should be so, otherwise, it makes it hard to make it hard to his team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is the rule.
The partners must probably study it right and detailed until they can finally play.
The description video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever just solved, will be fascinated as many feelings in this unlikely game.
However, totally, "Decrypto" is not very strictly strictly like progressors and Genre-Primus "codenames", which also makes an agent thematic on a game of little words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever only goes to the rats and not on the ways, it can also be easy to find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows the police Hitlergrus and occupied guests in the kneepe
A 48-year-old man occupied the police spectrum of Kulmbach in the evening of Saturday on Sunday.
First, he showed a police driver in the top town to the Hitler Green, and later fell also into the top city in a neighborhood when he was able to reach other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the location of the police, he had to carry out the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the hair cell.
He must therefore also be responsible for the use of signs of the officers of officers.
Business work Press was the house of the switch
The bathroom work in the Press was the shoes in France Wald for ten years.
1991 ended a piece of Eisenbahn history.
"When the buffer was struggled, you heard it in the whole press," remembered Georg Dinkel, which archived the story of the place and the shore office.
Nobody's going to get it up.
There the brems were silent, and the wagons were cutting.
That was the same wood front.
Examples that are imaginable for the dinecle's house Press.
There was nowhere in France Wald a place so far through the woods.
Here was the exit point of the steelrampen bridge tracks to the north, which has about 220 meters of height in the steinbach at the wood.
To make sure that, the previous travel and shoblocks were required that they had their home in the press.
1901 the Bayer Landtag approved the construction of a training office with 21 lokshops, teaching offices, traveling and traveling ships.
"Heartshock was the rolling box that had a driving mask of 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Bahnhistoriker and 47 years ago.
In 1968, Bamberg was also explored for the neighbouring Press - Tettau, Ludwigstown - Leaders, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northern Half.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported from a 160 man's personal material; 13 debats and eight Elloks were stationed in the press.
The electrorifising of the streams of 1939 has already minimized the need for toggle and switch.
Since 1977, they were only needed for goods.
At 1991, at least 10 000 wars were rated in the month.
1982 Parties of the operating work were interrupted, 1991 of the rest.
Heidrich: "It's amazing that you don't have a better usage of the location, even in the point of passenger transport, in the eye."
At Pfingsten 1989, the Nürnberg border direction to Jubilee "50 years electrorifization Nürnberg - Saalfeld" feeded a pomped bahnhofsfeest in Press.
"They were 100,000 surveys here," remembered Georg Dinkel.
It's a little later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were departed, the Ranger office was a story.
"The ragnangers and Hemmschullengers have caused the most difficult works in the transport," remembers the dencle.
Every mistakes had fatal consequences.
Why the bathhouse's Pressig Rothenkirchen carried out for the conversion of the herarchie of both places and there are many more historical and current images here in the internalPlus articles.

The annual pungsan jagdhund shall be the worst between the two Koreans.
In the effort of a disappearing of relations with Seoul, Pungengjang made a gift to the South Korean President Moon Jae In two northern Korean pungsan jagdhuden.

New week, new chance for government
Return to work - so the unofficial motive for the beginning week of the Great Coalition.
A interview, almost a talk in which the Cancers and their Ministers of CDU, SPD, and also from the CSU, have not made the "reaching to work" manual.
This may be so many handhelds, doctors, chassiers and other employed citizens in this country to the approved question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Agreement Government is now a long time to repeat its task - to the Government - you should not stop it now with the debates of it.
If the Union and the SPD can actually be able to move something together after the Provocations and Blamages of the last week, it may have already shown the Monday.
On the evening, the branches of the Government parties are together to the Coalition Committee.
Canzler Angela Merkel wants to call this round regularly to disturb conflict early; a teacher from all the war.
First, however, there is no conflict with the disciplines and the consistency of consistency on the day scheme.
CSU Transport Ministry Schwer wants the autoconcerns with board pressures slowly out, and SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the responsibility for technical pollution older Diel.
While this crisis has signed an approach in the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far from each other at the planned construction.
The SPD requires a bright perspective for denied asylum competitors to work or training.
The Union is stretched against the "shirt change" from the asylum system in the work market.
So it's going to be fighting again among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal is joined to GroKo, but three partners with very different society images and priorities.
The fight is good.
Without a war, one of such a variety, including anti-profit interests, doesn't proceed.
However, to be constructive, the fight cannot be built again from party-based reasons on the question of his or non-sein.
It's still about the policy, not about the theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but the life effects of people are in view.
What is done and uses many?
With this question, this is also possible to clarify pragmatically the question of diel and the scarwith question - and so trust.
In particular, the people parties have to fight now.

Smire rooms with local political message: No applied publication for scattering
In Langerich, the unknown type and ways for the construction of a scate range have been struggled.
In several areas, Jürgen Kohne of the city's administration on the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police's policy has been raised for a sach-behaviour.
In large letters, the shadows of the Gempt Halle and the Old Rathaus are the three words "Scatepark for Langerich!".
Michael Rotmann, the manager of the Hall, reports that after the professional election measuring measuring was already detected on September 19, a corresponding letter travel on the decrease of the exploitation to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message has been released openly "only" with an edition, they could have been removed without problem.
"What days later it was, but then again, it's going to get up this time," says Rootmann.
It says that the agreement should be replaced.
A special note is just this case that there are also several large companys called on the table.
If the scate range is built, their realization is also allowed by sponsors.
At the same time, Jörg Hesselmann has already explained to be named without the name of the citizen field of school, sport and culture.

The air safeguard is still worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg after the European air transport chaos in the summer, the German flows do not see signs for improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019, we will have strong wind and then come to the storm," said Matthew Maas, the German Presse Agency, before the airport pipe on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for multiple aircrafts and aircraft cases is the long-term known personnote in the European air safeguards, for which there is no rapid solution.
"The Airlines and the airports can get quick improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots ends four to five years," said the company.
In Europe, the market was empty for completely designed lots.
Only in the centre of Karlsrue to monitor the top German aircraum has been missing about hundreds of people.
Maas criticized that various air transport operations were not invited to the ship.
In the Hansstadt, the free-day representative of the Agreement, the countries, the air safeguarding, the airlines and the aircrafts are together to address the reasons of the negotiations.
"When you want to talk about additional worksquarters and overtimes, it will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members in the German air safeguarding.
Maas renewed the EU Commission's proposals for the Lotsen Mistress.
The transport prognoses for the running regulation period to 2019 were too lower.
The expenditure of costs and personal assessments in national air safeguards are currently full of the operational business.
Maas called to Mr. Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to enter into Brussels for rules that "the air safeguards are not further cutting."
Currently, the EU's bodies would be exceeded to 2024 and would be afraid of further disturbations.
The EU has been completed by the Lobby Printing since the airlines.
"Ryanair-header Michael O'Leary and his colleagues were now aware of what they sat in the last years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high-freeding costs in the air communities have been raised.
The GdF will only affect the improvement of the situation when the German air safeguard (DFS) offers a "heavy training and future package", said Maas.
The reported record of 120 Lotsen schools over the next five years is now reached to compare the old conditions.
The necessary personal building is not yet connected.

Pleite in Hertha: From the reality: Bayern requested against Ajax
The prediction is inaugurable to be: the deadline in Berlin will not "the FC Bayers."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach are now the first cross-face for Niko Kovac's office time.
