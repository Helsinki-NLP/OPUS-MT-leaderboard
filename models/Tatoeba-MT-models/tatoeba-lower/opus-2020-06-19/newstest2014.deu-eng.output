Goodch: Any more security for footnotes
You are not 100 meters away from each other: On Sunday, the new B 33 feet assembly is taken in the town parking place - in view of the older rathaus.
Two ships so close to each other: Avoid or shipping citizens?
This question has been clearly responding to Gutach citizens yesterday.
"The rathaus campaign has been installed once because it's safe to the school way," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Cluser Ampel safe as well as railways, as well as bus passengers and Bergle's inhabitants.
The official adjustment held yesterday is important for the cross-bachway Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, corpark, bus, a doctor and a bank, and the transport flow out of the area ›Grub.
"For the high transport and foot achievement, there was a further packaging to their safety," so Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landrat Offenburg.
"As the current measurements, at the B 33 day, about 12,000 vehicles, the Gutach community, which are about 10 per cent of gravity transport", says Arnold.
That is why the building of another plot is more than necessary: "Security is just here," so Arnold.
In total, four traveling views were implemented, also a cross transport was considered, however, rejected by the energy in the cross-bachway area of Sulzbachweg/Cirkstraße.
It was mentioned by Arnold at the location selection of the amplitudes before: "Methods of a extra for us with special wood loaders, we have exposed whether these vehicles can go out from the summer bathroom to the B 33, without retracting the masks of the aircraft."
The running of $15,000 steel is the "modernest thing that is present on the market," explained Arnold.
The entry is equipped with colored LEDs that light so strongly that the light of the car cars, for example, is well recognised by the deep sun.
And it's crazy, she also: the older lights use about 100 Watts, which are now eight times.
There are three lights for vehicles.
Arnold explained the technology of the new annex: This is equipped with two radarsensors.
If the feet presses the spin button, the top radarsensor tests the transport.
If the street is free, it comes immediately green for the feet, if not, it ends at about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be finished for the feet.
"If a group or disastered people go over the streets, the green phase will length, so everybody comes sure about the cars," said Arnold.
Of course, the car should be considered here as partner and watch the car.
This wasn't the case yesterday: The room showed the plot for the feet green, smoked a super class car through - with light red.

The booker prices are known in particular as Prosaautor, the theater texts are rar in his work.
Collection of prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher provides for his introduction "Watterlights on the language point", which is now to see in the Garage X on the Petersplace, so a collection of prosa texts together.
The theater macher connects some elements from the autobiographically associated Roman "The Life" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "League, his family bearing" (2003).
On the widely empty wood - important requies: a scarlet sofa, which is cutting and masturbing, is linked to the eight-head ensemble through the text material.

A blackbox in the car?
United States Street Planners are searching for a money source to reparate the nice highway system, and they believe that the solution is found in a small black box that finds in the armory board every room.
The devices that record each kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the nuclear point of a contrary trial from Washington and the Planning Offices of the Offices of the Budget States to transform the United States Finance System.
Normally, the more longer area of the streets planning has just developed a intensive debate with courageous allians.
Freedoms have linked environmental groups, and the Government says that the small boxes to record the income kilometers – and that may also be used – and then the information can be used for the calculation of stewards.
The Tea Party is excited.
The American Civil Rights Unit (ACLU) is also increasingly concerned and exceeds a number of data protection.
However, while you are not able to take some steps in the Congress, several contracts are not longer expected.
They are currently checking how they can change in the next ten years to a system, paying to the vehicle for a risked miles.
thousands of car carriers have already cut the vehicle writers from which some have been issued with GPS monitoring.
That's really a museum for our country.
“It's nothing that we can only use,” said Hasan Ihrata, officer of South California Asn. of Governments, which plants a record of the passenger miles in all California cars in the United States from 2025.
The type and way we pay these assets will be changed.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes to a time, since the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the officers, is solved by the US-Americans at the coffee cell.
But in America, it will not be so much as before.
Cars use less benzine.
The State Mineral Oil Control of 18,4 cents per gallone (except 4 Eurocent per liter) has not been increased since 20 years.
Politicals are not carried out in high prices, but the steel is not only to add a cent.
“The benzine staff is just not a future,” so Lee Munnich, an expert for transportation at the University of Minnesota.
His Agency has recently broken 500 cars with traveling letters, with which a miles-based payment system should be carried out.
"This gives the longest positive alternative," he said.
Burokrates are called a miles based users.
It isn't surprised that the ideas found in the city's Liberal Agreements, for example, the stealing had been entrusted to influence the carrier treatment so that the steady and climate disagreements would be reduced.
The californian planners set up on the system in the development of strategies with which the ambitioned objectives of the Agreement to change climate.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, President of the House Transport Committee, also explained that he saw the most longest alternative alternative in it.
The free markets of the Reason Foundation are also able to pay the travelers after replaced tracks.
"This is not a steel that lost in a black loch," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Directives in Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers who requested the Congress in an report in 2011 to be moved in the direction of milin-based abusion.
The U.S. Senat agreed last year an $90 million tire pilot project that had contained 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the representative house prohibited the presidency and reacted it to the opinions of delegates from the rural areas that represented people who often needed to leave a lot of miles on the way to work or to the city.
Many contracts and large cities are moved in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently affects 5000 vehicles for the greatest experience of the country.
These vehicles will soon pay the miles buyers instead of the mineral oil steel to the contract.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also describes this.
Illinois tests it in a limited way with Lkws.
And the I-95 Coalition, where the Transport Ministers of 17 Contracting States are at the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 free-free equipment with the devices, car carriers were skeptically thoughts, the government could follow each of their movements.
“Attention against Big Brother and such things was a great problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, leader of the Strategy and Result Management in Nevada's Transport Minister.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, Nevada’s ACLU warned on their website: “It would be relatively easy to convert the carriers to developed monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, close technological infrastructure that would not be used to achieve data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is a number of Member States who are now looking for a major technology, with which the State can achieve the income kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That, like Khan, would also be the public.
The jagd after this technology has brought some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally approved to help contracts in the management of vehicles.
Furthermore, it was its objective to put on a higher market for Kfz insurance foot to pay the vehicles on the basis of the secured miles.
However, their loaded devices are also interesting for the street planners because they don't work with GPS and provide only limited information that will be uploaded regularly by modem.
“The people are more ready to participate in if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, employer of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, there were great errors.
There are more valuable and less intrusive opportunities to convert it.
In Oregon, the planers are experimented to provide a number of choices.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no equipment and pay a breakfast on the basis of the average miles of all inhabitants of the contract.
Other institutions hope to sell the concept of a mysterious public, by providing the devices with more functions as less than less.
In New York City, transport officers want to develop a device to be able to pay for parking buyers, a safeguard must be paid only for safe kilometers, and the speed data from other vehicles in real time can be removed by the vehicle stays.
“Automobiles would be motivated to participate through the multiple value of the benefits offered by the system," says it in a town planning document.
However, some transport planners ask whether the whole cost of payments per mile is not only a serious manager.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay, the Congress could just solve the problem of the Highway Trust Fund with the increase of carbon steel.
A additional annually income or an annual delivery may be replaced by vehicles with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little benzine, so that they also pay a good share.
“No reason for an operation if an aspirin is too sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the leader of law and public issues of the Commission.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of car cars are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
King'sfield: Small manage is watching
The free firewall exploited their herbst main test, but personal manners with Bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the training.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had investigated the advertising Feder in the Burgberger Street.
There must be a short conclusion during the ship.
During the existing brand and the development of the smoking, two people were lost, but one of them could have been able to send a noble.
Two attempt guards were prepared after the first check of the proposals by Hans rooms to achieve the building.
After a short time, it was to find the first person and lead to free.
The second person had to be carried out.
This wasn't so easy, because it was also a threat to overcome.
The building, a workplace with integrated equipment for two horses, was not easy to ensure.
There was a lot of woods and strohballs in it.
Moreover, there were electrical machines for tree processing.
The first solution was successful over the tank in the vehicle.
Another guidance was held over a superflur hydrogen in about 100 meters away.
Three solutions could be held.
In the building, there was also a hole train.
Hans Camerer was also going to show how to edit a person who is available in a few cases.
In real case, a support on the day-assisting group of the King's field is successful.
The Commander showed that he was satisfied with the exchange of education.
High schools and companies important
At his visit in the landcreis Breisgau-High Blackwald, President Guido Wolf also in Titisee-Newstown explained where the work forces are come from tomorrow.
In the Foreign Centre of High Blackwald, he followed this important question with the business leaders of the employee schools, the cross-gimnasium and the President of the parents' representatives.
"It is a important location factor," understretched Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, which represented the disconnected school project of high-wheel education center.
It showed that Wolf was impressed on the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there exists a successful cooperation between the foreign centre, the cross-gymnasium and the employment centre.
Moreover, he praised the family kindness in the country.
"It's important to have not only the family phase in view, but also because of the demographic walls, the phase on the ability of behaviour of residents," said Wolf.
Moreover, he concluded that more employees were concerned about their employees and their employees.
"Unless the support of the employee can lead the resulting charge of the employees to the end of the work relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could help it to lose qualitative work forces, he said further.
Another, particularly important factor is the retail of high schools and enterprises.
"Who has already learned the proposals of the region during his study, it remains often obtained by its exploited knowledge and its ability to receive the regional economy, which is involved in strengthening the region," the President of the Landtag.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the needs of achievement could be covered.
His opinion is the location of the country cross its provisional situation in South-West Germany, directly near France and Switzerland.
Furthermore, on his border of Titisee-Neustadt after Freeburg, he had already taken the efforts for the development of the public transport.
"Continue fast and worry that the public traveling will be better," he explained to the address of the existing community policy.
Music lives a sustainable afternoon
Ready since 15 years, the family of Kaul sets the dieting seniors to coffee, coffee and then to a evening.
The older citizens in the rast place were courageous.
At midnight, this afternoon is found in the Pflegeheim St. Josef in place.
The households enjoyed the nice kitchen and gates.
Afterward, it's got a wrest sales.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
For more than 100 years old natural stone walls as the previous limit of the old school office of the church street, it shall be replaced with the saving costs of the city breunling.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first works of sanction of the previous school office, stabilization and statistical disposal of the older natural steel wand with ballare for centuries of years.
In addition, Alexander Misok, from the Brownling City Building, looks forward to the plannings and to create a sanitary concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation shall be taken by failure which will then be made to the Council to decide and establish the further procedure on the table.
A decision on this is, immediately, already falls in the next year.
After the saneing, planting and tree planting of the old school office in the two sides of 1912, school has to be built as a resulting measure, the health needed limiting walls are based on and on the new substruction.
The historical, one hundred years old restriction wall of the old school office to the church streets, especially through water and fresh stress, because there is no drainage, needs health and has a bowling.
Deep rocks in individual stones are proved of witches, but the wall is currently not dangerous.
A standing wall is a condition for a schoolhouse used by students, which has been successful by the current confirmation work.
Originally, the school officer has already been planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures have brought a movement.
An important word in the historical educational sculpture, which has already been used for films, will be discussed by the country's demamalm.
If the proposals come from this side, the city will hope to be broken on the advantages of the dreams.
Learns of the branching schools who are trained again in a good healthy old school building with new schools can soon be used by the old school school.
Edemir wants Jazzas education in Stuttgart
In the main discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Green Budget President, has now been enabled.
"I'm not able to make the whole education in the music school Stuttgart," said Ozdemir to the Stuttgarter's news.
Jazz and classic are just in the Jazz position of Stuttgart.
In this regard, Ezdemir, which applies to a direct mandate in Stuttgart, on 22 September, the Green-Round Lands Government.
This forces the basis of a expert study a reorder of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, in addition to the study course Jazz and Pop from the music school Stuttgart to the Manheim music school.
U.S. Green: "Super tunnel" detected to drug smoke
At the border between Mexico and the United States, an "Super Tunnel" detected and set up to drug smoke.
As the US Zoll Authorities reported, the more than 500 meters of long round between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, bottles and an exhibition.
Three suspects were taken after that, eight tons of marihuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel was not yet taken in use by the data.
"These cards are stupid, if they say that they could be entered under the Radar," said the general State officer of the Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in San Diego, where it was discovered the end of the tunnel.
To the drug banks, Duffy said, "When you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are decided to make it to a large consumption of your low money."
As well as the US authorities and the Mexico Security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cards.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people were killed in Mexico in relation to drug crime.
Built from experts
According to the outside location of the tunnel, the drivers say that he was built by architectures and engineers and that the building took a year for a year.
The glass range was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building that has been removed 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters to the depth to the real tunnel.
The tunnel has a square of 1,20 meters height and 90 centimeter width.
He would also be appropriate to promote the illegal investment of the United States direction.
Two of the suspects were determined in relation to the Cocaine Fund.
The third, a Mexican, was made by Marihuana's advised.
All three are driving as the maximum trap of life long freedom, as the officers said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels were detected, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that it was found in a tunnel building Kokain.
Normally, cocaine is in small quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "depression" of the drugsbands who were traditional rounds in the midst, Bill Sherman said by the Drug DeA in San Diego.
They would do everything to go to the United States.
There were no details known to the festivals, at least one of the mexicans, said it.
You have to calculate with steel trains to ten years.
2014 is a festival
The jubileum of the city Gesingen, within 1250.
Returning the first urgent statement is always closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the July Year is attracted.
Years and church houses were first mentioned in the first time together.
In the church, an urgent was made in the case where both places were mentioned.
On March 15, a official attraction to the July Year, and since the foods are currently no hall, this office is located in the place where they were mentioned both of 1250 years before, in the church houses.
In the framework of the Jubileum, some events have been planned as well as in the church houses.
Kirchen-Housen is 1250 at the end of a feast of 18 to 20 July in July.
Feed back.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday, with a feast around the church hall.
At the end of this feast, the church household feast is still.
The city music director Rudolf Barth wrote for the city, instead of the Jubilee, a committee for three terms.
On 21 June, together with the Saturday Federation of Black Wald, on 12 July in the Arena with firework and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival.
This will be completed and approved in July Year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
Instead of the town jubileum, a new chronic is also produced.
"It's not only to be a cronical to himself, but a printed work on the eatings of today, which is also of the church houses, leipferdings, golfings and goodmadings," so burger Walter Hengstler.
And also the celebration of the 2014 birthday, 1974, has been fulfilled today's room with the agreements.
The new chronic shall then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival.
However, 2014 is also a year with many jubilees.
The Narrrenzung Strohglnki begins on February 8, with a weapon in place of its 60-year existence, the harmony of goodmadings will be 90 years and has the feeding bank on 29 March and feeds from 1 to 4 May.
The old work of Leipferdings will be 40 years old, the food school has been 50 years in the new place and feeds it on 10 May, the musician Polyhymnia Leipferdings will be 150 years old and feeds it in the framework of the brunish feast of 4 to 7 July.
The city Gesingen was mentioned in an urgent urgently in the possession of the Kloster's St Gallen in 764.
The urgent was made in the churches (Housen), which was a court place.
Both congregations are then mentioned in the same origin.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250 years in accordance with, additionally, the common deform is 40 years back.
The Council takes the glass in the Viewer
Whether the track transition should be rebuilt in order to increase the safety of transport.
Yes, the communities have decided.
Sheltach must take 220 000 euros in the hand.
In the next year, Germany will improve Kinzigtal bathstreaks.
In particular, the safety should be increased in shipping transactions - regularly, it is along with collisions of trains with other vehicles.
In order to vote to the churches to the rebuilding measures, they must participate in a third party in the cost, share the rest of the ships and contracts.
Shiltach's city treebournester Roland Greeßhaber explained to the assembly's specialities of the border transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a explosion at the west of the tunnelmudes.
There may also be larger vehicles, for example, transporting the long-terms, standing in transport, without blocking the same.
The Greece officer therefore proposed to build a needed support wall so that the city could extend the following streets to a timely time to ensure a disasterless transport flow.
This was discussed in the Community's Controvers, because some rooms went doubtfully to the need of a street distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his expression, brought the criteria to the point: "Will we take so few vehicles so much money in the hand?"
Civil Master Thomas Haas: The front transition "Hirschen" will be used regularly for long wood transports.
Even the tree from the "Kuhbach" area will be partly transported on these streets, because the vehicles can't use the streets in the heads of the hair, because they could not go down there to the main streets.
Furthermore, the tracks are intended for the vehicles that can't use the tunnel when the main street is locked.
It is likely that Kirchberg and Clossberg Tunnel must be converted and healthed as this is currently in Wolfast case, it may also be a significant importance for a longer period of transport.
The challenges agreed to examine what costs would be caused to cause the achievement of the streets.
Despite this, the construction of the passenger was mostly agreed with the measure that the needed support walls would be built so that the city could build the following straight direction of the "Barnhofstraße" for the trading trading around 5,5 meters.
The rebuilding of the border transition at the Gerberi Trautwin may be a whole other problem that affects the experience in the strong "Geroltz House Road".
The Management had to investigate the grounds of the front of the engineer Office Breinlinger, since it doubted whether the planned conclusion of the farmer's way is still unable to be.
The investigation resulted that it would not be excluded that the neglective relationships of the streets could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility for this is replaced by the city as a street training.
The rebuilding can then be moved after captivities.
While the wood carriers and the areas worked in the current structure, you should not apply the rebuilding of the border transition.
In this position, the risk of a collision of the passenger with a vehicle on the transition is clearly less than the other board transitions, since the middle point is directly located to which a good view connection is established.
Even the travels from the main staff should be at this place as long as disappeared that no collision has been drowned.
Mostly, the construction of this ship was denied by the agreement because the city Schultach had needed the problem with steadfast vehicles, so that the board could be returned after the end of building works from the responsibility.
As unproblemally, the Gremium considers the constructions to the borders "For Haubach" and "For Kuhbach" for the already cross agreements with the border.
This decides about large world space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitation rooms or black leckers - experts of the European room officers must now be a few large projects who want to start in the next year.
30 proposals have been chosen, five are still on the road.
Other worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomes.
If there's at least some of them's life, no one knows.
The selection is hard: search for gravitation rooms?
Or do you want to investigate the origin of the cosmos?
Or do you find out an extraordinary life after earthquake planets?
These questions are just the responsibilities of the European Space Taging of Esa.
For its "Cosmic Vision" program, they look for ideas for two large space travel projects that will be determined to propose the research.
The state for such "L-missions" is even at a billion euro.
The start will be likely to be 2028 and 2034.
In the beginning of September, the European World Research was in Paris to discuss proposals for these missions.
30 Idees standing to the debate, five of them have now come into the low choice.
A number of grims encourage the proposals to achieve the researchers.
In the next days, a final decision shall be made by the scientific programme Committee.
All four large questions have chosen Esa to find the answers of the missions in the programme "Cosmic Vision" in 2007.
What are the conditions for the development of planets and life?
The exact steps in the displacement of stars from large gas flowers - and so also the disappearance of planets that turn around these stars - still in the speaker-which darkness.
A great infrarot shop in all could train this dark.
And if a star has a planet, in which circumstances can live there?
In order to follow this question, the world room telescope "Cheops" will be started in 2017 with 500 already known planet systems in our nearest environment.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomes can imagine similar planets and even analysize the composition of their atmospheres and look for "Bio Marks": gass that applies to bioactive activities as index.
How does the sun system work?
This question also should also be concluded on what conditions there are for the development of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the change effect of its magnet fields and the outside of it with the planet system.
In our sun system, these processes will be exemplary.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa has already approved a mission of M-class (where the budget is at about a half billion euro) for this question.
The Sunday will start 2017 and observe the surface and the activities of the sun.
From great interest for researchers are Jupiters and its months.
You want to find out what role of the ries planet has played in the development of the sun system.
For this, Esa sees the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sonde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins in 2022.
Eight years later, they get Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet and the needed months of Europe, Calisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the Universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study materials under extreme conditions and so to examine whether our knowledge of nature is still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that could show physicians the way to a new theory, including all the knowledge of nature.
How has the universe come out and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was held through the Urknal.
Besides our traveling material, from the stars, planets and lives as we exist, there is Dunkle Materie, which consists with the gravity of galaxies and galaxies, and Dunkle Energy, which has the expansion of the world.
The researchers don't know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the urineal, even though Dunkle Material and Dunkle Energy.
With "Euclid", Esa has already committed a M-mission that has been proposed for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sun will first examine the distribution of materials in the universe in the whole sky and allow back clauses to the manufacture of dark materials and dark energy.
Who could make the road?
From the 30 proposals, only two remains at the end of the election procedure.
The best opportunity for a volunteer as L mission has, according to the opinion of many experts "E-Lisa", a positive concept for the proof of gravitation rooms.
In addition, physical changes are understood in the structure of the room time that Albert Einstein had proposed about about 100 years ago.
They weren't listed until today.
Elisa could create that, hoped scientists behind the project.
The mission sees one of the two or three soldiers, which is stationed in all.
He could also demonstrate gravitation rooms that have been held in the orphanal and provide such new knowledge about the development of the cosmos.
Four further proposals continue to concurrent about the second L-mission: a large röntgentelescope named "Athena", which should be investigated under the other black solutions, "Icy Planets", another mission to the external planets of the sun system, "Prism", a mission to promote the cosmical background training, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will look forward and investigate.
In addition, there are other proposals for the test-request transport from Mars, the research of the moon, Venus and Asteroids and the sunphysics.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany in relation to the United States Survey
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, explained that he was ready to go to Berlin and to get out before the German contract day, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander does not give answers about their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele traveled Snowden on Sunday in Russia, where this asylum has received to discuss with him the exhibition in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on the freedom of Ströbelle, he wrote: “Every though the result of my efforts was positive, my Government treats a different opinion as a reproach and try to criminalize the political opinion with strategy, which is not possible to defense.”
But the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American Government of it to attach the attack to him.
The accommodation of the United States Justice Ministry contains Spionage and Debstail of State Health.
The German Inner Ministry Hans-Peter Friedrich said about time online: “When Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German representatives, we will find a way to allow it.”
The relations between the United States and Germany are loaded by the agreements that the NSA has heard the phone from Kanzler Angela Markel.
Thomas Opermann, the Secretary-General, who leads the Parliamentary Committee for the Secret Service, explained that the opportunity to receive the opportunity to hear snows as a witness, if it is possible to “no dangerously and to destroy the relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green Secretary-General, published a picture of himself and snowd in his Twitter feed.
He was joined at his visit in Russia from two German journalists.
Strobele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA Middleman Snowden, he could not return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden goes out in Germany, then he needs a confidence that he is there 'sure', so the Secretary-General.
Snowden explains in his letter that he looks out a “increasing and continuing” persecution campaign who lost him out of his house.
However, he has been concerned by the world's reaction to the "mine act of political opinion".
Citizens in the world and high policys – also in the United States – have marked the advantages on an uncontrolled system as a service to the universal.
In his letter, Snowden gives the German authorities a proposal of cooperation, “if the difficulties were resolved around the humanitarian situation.”
Frontier Airlines offers ships for handpacks
Frontier Airlines plans to demand to 100 US dollars of passioners who want to lose their airports.
Frontier Airlines observes until 100 US dollars for a piece of packing and calculating 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the visit at middleday, the passors should keep the whole dose.
The new passenger is applied to handshops in the box over the seat, small balls under the seat are still uncovered.
The Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the payers were paid forward, and 100 US dollars for travelers who sold only on the airport.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the payer of 100 US dollars would take place in the field to take care of the payment.
“We don't want to calculate this sum,” she explained.
Flug companies started in 2008 to request the first and second offered payments.
Passagiers who have tried to run these, therefore have stopped as much as possible in the manufacturer, which has consequences that the shops are often filled over the seat.
The passengers are a possibility to move passors to take less with the boat.
O'Malley said it's not really going to pay money in the new guest.
It's about the loyal customers of Frontier, who would clearly have expressed that it will always be difficult to find a place on the seat.
Passages that buy your tickets on the website of the airport should not be paid.
This means that a passage at the airport of the frontier may take a packaging in the circumstances, but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a comparable packaging.
O'Malley explained that the website of frontier and the Check-in procedures would be changed, so that the passors should be informed about the passengers before they come to the airport.
The new Frontier's new handshop is only in the room, and there is no exact date yet.
Passaging ships are often shipping on ships and other offers, but aircraft companys are welcome to reach it.
They argued that the transport of the payment should cost and passors pay this service if they want him.
Many of the Wall Street consider the new reliefs as a sign that the airport companys take enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after years of losses.
However, most of them allow the fingers of payments for handshots.
Espirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as the first offer for hands and later followed Allgiant Air, also a bicycle traveler.
The only other aeroplane company with such a guarantee is the Ungarian Wizz Air, the Airline Berater Jay Sorenen, who noticed the additives.
He assessed in a report of December 2011 that the manufacturer Spirit income annually 50 million dollars.
The sorenes who had a leading position in the Midwest Airlines recently fled with the spirit and was neutral to expect him on the airport if passors would be compared to the unregular manufacturer of the company.
“The Boarding process was the losses that I lived in my airport in the airport,” he said.
I expected to see digital and handmaid discussions on the airport.
“The aircraft was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was like a smoke.”
Frontier follows the Spirit also for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tee, limonade or safe.
The company explained that passors, buying limonade or saft, could keep all doses and be filled freely.
The water is still uncovered.
The US Airways tried shortly to ask for the refrigeration of money, but it turned back seven months later after the passions were deceived and no other big company had been followed.
The frontier step to uphold payments for the manufacturer if passors don't buy directly in the air community, the latest initiative should be carried out with the customers on their own website.
Flug companies pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10-25 US dollars for sale ticket.
This gives all companies a request to move passors to directly buy with them instead of a online travel office.
However, the Frontier has gone in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half of so many multi-free travellers when booking on a online travel office.
On midnight, the miles were buried once to 25 per cent of the aircraft.
One aircraft packed with frontier over 1000 miles, which brings customers only 250 miles.
Passages may also be reserved by the direct buy on the website of Frontier Places.
The frontier has a faithful customer staff at his sitting in Denver, but the business is broken and the company lost money.
The solution returned to 9 per cent, and the aircapability was struck about 13 per cent in the first quarter, as it is to read in the financial report, which was published in the middle of the Mother Concern, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to achieve the funds of frontier in the market in the sale of the society.
Proverbs come from the Bible
40 women have visited the last night of women in this year in the evangelical church community.
The theme of the day in the church house were "Speaking words from the Bible" and "Speaking from the Mediterranean."
Zita Kuhler, the president of the church community race, went after the morning in a proposal to the Bible’s languages.
"The speaker contains knowledge of life, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several expressions with the Bible’s writers and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: "The tree is weak, as the skins fall from the eyes, a eye to a man, whose Lord is in sleep, and his hands swallow in iniquity.
Moreover, the referencies also gave their audiences to what a parable it had been done.
The speakers of the Middle Ages took the church community of Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, smoking something.
She explained the meaning and the origin of the speaking applications that they called "breaks in the past."
To conclude, a tombola was lost.
The prices were covered on a table and were completely overwrited before they were delivered to the winters.
Under the visitors of the morning rounds, the citizens candidat Roman Waiznegger was also confused.
Learning in place without work: Pilot project for students in tourism
On the Mecklenburg sea platte starts a pilot project for the tourism.
Under the Government of the Budget Working Agency, 49 women and men who have already worked as unlearned in the branch, more than three winds will be qualified for hotels and guests.
"Now it is that the six-month curses end with clusters," said Carmen Watchert from the Newbrandenburg Working Agency.
The use is much: the participants would not be unemployed by the companies fighting stronger powers that have always missed in hotels and guests, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
In the project, the industry and trade campaigns are also participated in Newbrandburg and the German Hotel and Gast City Verband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg.
NSA explains an "internal error" and not hacker's fault on the web site
The shocked National Security Agency explained on the late freedom, an error has launched their public website a few hours and not Hacker, how online it was said.
“NSA.gov was not available tonight for a few hours since a planned update has occurred an internal error," explained the Spionage Agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be moved on this evening.
The meaning that the event was caused by a deal of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the last night, online server trackers found that the NSA website was not available at least six hours and this is not yet available for some users.
A NSA speaker on ABC News had explained that the sensible internal network of the Authority has been compromised “in any way.”
The secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists took for themselves the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be overrided with page flowers until the server is overloaded and the website is collected.
The Cyberactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve in the internal network of the target system.
The previous NSA super- secret name, which is one of the names No Search Agency (No such authority), is in the light of the public, and sees the reviews known in the last months of its exposed monitoring programme in the In- and outland serious critics – a result of the secret NSA data that have been published and published by the decisioned old NSA Mietworkers Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy on the secret service ordered starting speculations about that, while today, the result of a targeted Cyper operation.
The number of people without a job is easy for 22 to 1.307.
Although the quote with 3,1 per cent better than the last year and even better than in September, "We had hoped more," says Monica Felder board, the employer of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many operations have been reacted for a long time in the settings.
There is a reason for this: "We have no powers in the handheld, in health and in the age."
Years are running since September also returned posting offers for persons in hotel and hostels.
In the middle of December, the Wintersaison begins there.

Guinee builts in Bombardiers after receipt of payments and jobs
The Canadian Airport and Eagle Fabric Bombardier Inc reported on the Sunday a 15-% reaching of the net wine after he had been exposed by retracts and expenditures in airports in the third quarter, and the contract problems in the Eastern Party.
Bombardier with Sitz in Montreal also published no airport test data for his brand new airport of CSeries and gave no new outcome about whether the aircraft could go in commercial use in the next September.
On the young flight of the test airport for a half months, only three further starts have been followed, which will appear in question if the test phase is moved as planned.
The results remained behind the prognoses and led to a curses from over eight percent to the board of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, an analysis at the National Bank Financial, sent his evaluation on the Sunday of the “outperform” to the "sector perform" in view of that the action has a limited competition in the next one to two quarters.
“Swar has been expected to be long-termly expected to be longer, but we are very clearly discovered by the market development in the transport area," said Doerksen in a client.
We are thinking that Bombardier will receive new provisions for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft is prevented.
However, if there are no new statements in the next months, we hope that the market will be more sceptic to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSEries airports can category the company in the under market segment which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test airport was presented in March and flew after monthly periods first in September.
Nevertheless, the CSeries has been moderated with 177, because potential buyers want to wait and see whether the achievements of the company are complied with the efficient and cost parential of the new airport.
Currently there are 403 statements and customers of 15 customers and companys.
The President Pierre Beaudoin is convinced that Bombardier will obtain its objective of 300 connected terms to the beginning of the commercial use of Jet.
The implementation of the undertaking was ensuring on the Sunday on the analysis and media, and the programme is in the term plan.
“The test airport is not longer left on the ground than expected,” said Beaudoin at a phone conference and added, while the ground test and software updates were set.
Every manufacturer plants different.
We have decided to take a first air and then add a transformation period, which we have done.
This happens during the whole aircraft.
The second of five test aircrafts will be expected to be started in the next week, the remaining shortly after, it was a company page.
Nevertheless, the first client can take a CSeries airport to operate 12 months after the younger flight of the first client.
Bombardier explained that it checks the planning for the industry (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
“The long-term advantages of the air test – even if they are obviously agreed with the internal planning Bombardiers – strengthens our view that the introduction is moved to the first quarter 2015,” said Doerksen.
At the third quarter of the end on September 30, Bombardiers Nethogewind fell on 147 million dollars or 8 cents per action of 172 million or 9 cents per action in the year ago.
The adjusted wine per action is not changed by 9 cents.
The measure was smaller and sank of 4,2 to 4,1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a winning of 10 cents per action and a rate of 4,56 billion dollars, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft produced in this quarter 45 aircraft, a backward of 57 in the last year.
The net notifications fall from 83 aircrafts to 26.
The employment in the air and space travel party was 30 September 32.9 billion dollars, and it was unchanged on 31 December.
“In the area of air and space travel, the results were made within the framework of our proposals, but the lower tasks and the market relations were totally disappeared,” said Beaudoin.
The rate in the air and space travel party falls for 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's biggest ferry manufacturer, knew that the use in this party was increased at $11 per cent to $2,1 billion.
The transfer party was raised on 30 September 32,6 billion dollars, and it was easy to increase on 31 December.
The victory in the transport area has been involved by development problems in some large contracts.
According to the implementation of the companies, it will be given new proposals for the fourth quarter.
The Bombardier Action on Sunday was 8,5 per cent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, and it was also announced that the Google Financial Representative Patrick Pichette would be changed in the state.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft producer and bombbardiers, reported on the Sunday a ten percentage of the quarter wind.

Cocaine dependent lawyer, who warned the drug boss before police examination, must be in prison
Basharat Dieta, 42, gave information on the environment size Neil Scarborough further
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to the light
He was judged by Liverpooler Crown Court to three years of prison.
A known criminal defense who warned a drug baron before a great police reputation because he was afraid that his secret drugs could be discovered were judged for three years.
Basharat Dieta, 42, rejoiced under-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on drug activities after he was compromised by his own cocaïne air.
The privileged lawyer of criminals as "exclassyg" with the "bash" name was arrested in his house after the police Scarborough was watched in a previous drug procedure.
Officers observed how Scarborough (32) three cookay in the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a food of the lawyer.
The meditation reported that thista regularly consumed drugs of class A after the tests of cocaïne were found in his hair, on his letters and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to provide information on the arrest of two men in the task of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four sufferers were then watched by the police in the framework of a large helicopter of heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were arrested later with 32 other persons after a number of household investigations of heroin and cocaine in value of 1,5 million £ and 200,000 £ in bargeld.
Thista, 42, gave further information to the crimes because he feared his drug dependence could be published.
Today, Dieta, who works for the Cancer Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was funded and judged at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two attachment points for the prohibition of justice.
He gave the cocaine behavior in a previous question.
The lawyer was transmitted after the police discovered that this was in regular phone contact with Thista in February 2011.
Two medical officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to this house, and there the drugs with a pureness of 60% in a black golf handshoh in the middle of the lawyer.
Scarborough regularly telephoned with Dieta, who was located in the feet of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, the drugs took up and then nine communications were issued between both.
For the Court it was known that Thista was a “regular consumption” of Kokain after the tests of the Class A drugs were detected in his hair, his letter and his credit cards.
Thista was arrested later, but try to take cocaine and said he had spoken with the Muslim Dealer because he was his manner, and he said that their discussion was under the "Autor's secret."
During his arrest, Dieta took his letter and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and took a hair test.
In the Police Affairs, he said that he would call him home because of legal matters, as well as under his private address and on the workplace.
For the Court, he was known that he was the important acts of the drug trade from which he had previously submitted, after a significant detention and had informed about what the experts knew about them.
The State lawman Anne Whyte said: “A criminal law lawman should be better than everyone else know that it doesn't matter the law.”
Thista will be attached to the misusing of his position as a criminal defense, since he has been allowed too much with certain mandaters.
The questionnaire relationship is not simply the drug manager, but a drug manager who provides his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was doubtless legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
However, it was long over the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandant.
He effected the policy medicines as much as possible, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
That's why Mr. Dasta brought his employment.
He was close to certain mandaters, especially Scarborough, and he allowed it to be compromised by his independentity.
This was because of every mistakes of himself and said: “If I would have been a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I wanted to give Scarborough information, I would not wait for 15 hours, but to do it immediately."
However, after the audience, the superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire: “Mr. Thista has made the step from a criminal defense to a crime at the moment when he started to build drugs from organized crimes.”
His cocaine dependence led to an unexpected compromitation and made it recommended for the motive leadership members of the organizated criminality, which offered him to receive valuable information on policy issues.
The customers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and care in the public for confidence and confidence.
Thista has gone through this confidence and tried to smoke behind his employment.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the reputations against Dieta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the property of cocaïne and jurisdiction, which underlines our decision to bring criminals before the judge.
This case should be a warning and demonstrate that no one can go away from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you before the Court.
Scarborough himself was condemned at 14 years of prison after he declared the condemnment of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-fifty more persons participated in the drug trade were judged in total 153 years by drugs.
On his website, Dieta published a area with questions and answers about himself, in which he gave his dream job is to be as an advocate Mandant in the Dead Sell in America, his final guest in the evening is Mohammed Ali and the opportunity to be the motivation for his work.

Haslach: Skepsis is important in view
The choice of the Pharmaceutical Council 2015 will, for example, change the basic chair unit (SE) in the Seaslach unit.
Then there is only another common passenger rate for all six passengers.
In a common meeting, the grims of Haslach, Hoslach, Haslach, Haslach, Mullerbach, Fisherbach, Steinach and Welshstein were prepared on the changes.
For the basic decisions of the disease is nothing more to change and it is to the shipping officers to use these possiblely satisfied.
In the day, it was particularly clear that the shops against the new are important but in view of a review.
From the proposals and expectations of the renewings 2015 to the concrete proposals on the future cooperation and the size of the Pharmaceutical Council, the extern constructive conversation of the six grims with the main official of the soul organ.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly fair guidelines for Sea Sea Area Units in the Erzdivose Freeburg.
Afterward, the SE Haslach is in the future a body of the public law, which enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches.
It will only be given to a common passenger initiative and a steering Council in which the manufacturer's power is represented Amtes.
From each Pharrie, at least two selected members should be represented, in the six pharries are designed by the Community's field.
Your task will be future to promote the church life in place.
In the question of the financing of the individual passenger community, there was greater need to talk.
The newspapers suggest that the collected guarantees remain attached to the plots.
The competences go over to the assembly.
In view of the great planned investments, which will then take all the Pharriums, there was a great view.
"And in the past was only invested in projects that could be solved by the individual pharmaceuts," related Haslach President Bruno Prinzbach related.
Practical experience with a common gremium for five Pharriums wrote Barbar Ritter, the President of the Gremium in the Sea Sea Sea-Wald-Neuried unit.
They did 2006 to the task "one, five remains" and had to determine that it wasn't so simple.
The grims of the Haslacher's Agency were then responsible for the future cooperation and size of the Joint Pharmaceutical Council and the practical work of the Common Independent Team.
The processing will be concretized in additional meetings and will be decided in a further joint meeting of all six crowns in the next morning.
At the end of the presented pharmaceutical community, Michael Beener from Steinach is the new logo of the Sea Saturday Unit, which has been approved with a clear majority.
In Pfulendorf, the Strom is struggle
The citizens of Pfulendorfs must be set up to higher power costs.
As the officer of the town worker, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SUDKURIER, come to a four-headed Pfulendorfer family 70 to 90 euros more costs per year.
The essential reason of the present price increase is the increase of the EEA environment of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilometres.
This framework shall be refixed every year in October by the four operators of the large strokes.
These include the most costs of the energy consumption, which can highlight them by a review of the energy price.
The city works Pfulendorf pictures the last member in this cate.
The monitoring Council of the Energy Affairs was even out of a higher environment as Jörg-Arne Bias reported in its prognoses.
Now the customers should be calculated before the town works could inform their customers about the exact price higher.
"We're going out of 1 cent plus x," so bye, where the number is next to the 2 cents.
Amply at length: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes it's not just green.
The contact bed in the street does not react, or the light mark is defect.
What do you want to do - to go to the Red?
If an interested person waited for a red ample and the cross is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart lawman Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorrad".
But the time of wait must be "accepted" which may be made different from the case.
Becker takes to stay at least five minutes before a functional destruction of the aircraft is gone.
However, whoever continues the travel, but Rotlights, should be in the cluster of the fact that he causes the full offence for a caused accident.
He who patients less than five minutes is not waiting for a long time under circumstances, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a vehicle had ignored the amplot after about three minutes, and he had to respond to a driving road rate.
The ample wasn't defected, but spread a little later on Green.
A car prohibition left him because of the special situation, but the money trip did not.
The Community Council rejoices on the solid budget
Always, if it goes to the budget meetings, Mr. Ralph Gerster is well laughing.
The community sackle in Herdwangen Schönach is well fulfilled, and sins are not already known by the management since 2005.
The budget year 2012 may also be fully successful in this meaning.
This was clear in the presentation of the annual calculation for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative household with about 7,6 million euros is higher than planned.
The overseer of the Administrative House also includes about 1,8 million euros around a million euros on the attachment.
The overseer is particularly higher water protection measures and the Community index in the income management.
The household also was clearly reached on the planned values.
Instead of the proposed 1,5 million euros, it increased 2,5 million euros last year.
"This is in the meaning of the higher access from the administrative house," says Rothmund.
Since less investments were certified in the budget 2012 as planned, the reimbursement is also higher.
The general retail could be increased around 2,1 million euros at the time of the total of 4,9 million euros.
Master Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for good work.
"It's a work you're not simply protecting out of the smoke," Jerster bought with a look at the year.
He and the communities rejoiced in view of the good numbers.
It can sing paradox, but exactly these good numbers can be able to stay faster.
By the good financial arrangement, the community in the past could react to high exhibitions.
However, it has already been deleted by Gerster's later committees from the country.
For these assets of various equipment, there are conditions.
Otherwise, the cities and the congregations requested by the committees must provide certain exemptions.
"The subject of the episodes must be looking at us because in the next years of investment, for which we liked advisers," said Gerster in this connection.
Nanold: Hugo Wermter since 60 years in Chor
With 60 years as songs, Hubert Wermter's story in the men's assembly Cecilia has almost doubled as long as the herbs feast, in which he was held feast.
Hubert Wermter was as living in the colors of his men's conspiracy on the bown.
Even after 60 years, his song is still a lot of pleasure.
In the Treaty, Burmter was also active, including 28 years ago as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and its uniforms he received several indications: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referent in the mission of the Rottenburg-Stutgart Rottenburg-Stutgart, he provided him - because the core is also a church court - an urgent of the Verband and one of the Bisof Gehard Prime.
His song colleagues overcome him the origin of the German Chorverbands and a gravitated cyntler.
Besides the earning, the 31th herbest feast was able to live in towns: with the MGV Betra, the singer cross of Salzstetten, the songs of Baisingen and the local musical community, the full-margins had loaded a mixing of various challenges and spectacular styles, which were located around 400 visitors.
The MGV fulfillment opened with voteful songs like "In wine paradise" and "Lustig, brothers."
Their honourable Hubert Wermter prepared them to celebrate another little room - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts "bandslied".
The men's bondman Betra also sang classical crowds like the "shirts" of Julius Wengert, "We, far away" from Hubert Goisern, and the peopleslied "When you go through the Tale".
The singer cross of Salzstetten was worried with his mysterious crown and his women's group - the "Impulschor" - for the women's quote of the festival.
The Mixed Chor began with the Neapolitan Population "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" of Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also turned back to foreign languages: "Liberation" and "Hey Jude".
The Songer Department of the Baining Sports Federation came with "What is the Swob?" of Hans Sussmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" back to the home-filde, where the full-making musical assembly is attached to the chronic musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small neighbour program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsiteimer, led a couple and read a few storys that the kids worked at the midday.
Child dreams are true
The children's gardens and children's day towns in the zolleral district are reached in these days.
The Black Walder Mail wants to support the institutions in cooperation with the building House and the Zollernalb.
Would the children's garden take a new sandbox?
All children's gardens, children's days and children crises from the whole solar cycle.
If you have a build or beauty for your installation, you can confront it with the black wood mails.

Chenical prices refers to the controlled medium health
"We are in an urgent situation, and we can ask: What does the Parliament take from to make the legal independence tomorrow tomorrow?", was reading in the journal that keeps the law design for non-compliance.
“The law is draconical and very straight and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, employer of the Capital Group, who also includes CapitalFM, one of the most independent radio stations and news websites Kenias.
He said that the new media paymental “we will always be taken, because it is a long-term arm of the Government” and the limits in the content and publication would be concerned with Keniah's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listen to us and we call him to deny this law design and to send it back to the Parliament," he said.
According to the magazine The Star takes the Government through the new law “the media effectively in a battle.” The standard, democracy and speaking freedom in Kenya would have made a "a severe threat" and subjected the design as "draconical".
The legislation is a number of measures with which national security should be strengthened by armed Islamists at the West Gate Investment Centre in September.
The chenical media raised the wrath of the authorities because they published safeguard cameras to see, as the aid of the Luxury Investment Centre was requested to the office.
The policeman David Kimaiyo reacted to it with the introduction of two journalists and a leading medium contractor, even if the proposal was turned back after a call of the media.
After the new law, media householders may be punished with a crime from 20 to 20 million Kenian shields and will be excluded by individual journalists with a million and another risk to lose their professional recognition or excluded by a official pressing credit.
The Court also has the right to consider the possession of the concerns if no crime is paid.
According to Daily Nation, “the most radiosessers can be carried out in the bankrott.”

The new attached opposition is covered with a new coffee.
One who is intended to reach and return.
One who wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, Lexikon is a psychological phenomenon that expresses the feeling that a new situation has already been alive or has seen.
In the case of visiting the same coffee at the record in the Cleve City of Kleve in visibility to the high school of Rhein-Wal, it is not necessary to stay in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the coffee with the beautiful name is exactly the objective: a real rest is not only grateful, but it's always able to make it back again.
Because it makes it fun and it's just nice.
A look in the entire life in Chapter 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.

"Sweet, successful and nice," they found both 33 years old.
But not every man's case.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not an explanatory fan of events: "Man can't make it right now."
And with one event, I'm always talking to those who also interest in the special event.
That is why events will be more the exception with us.
"We want to shoot the whole normal operation as less as possible."
Whether to be named: Déjàvu is also for freedom.

"When it is possible to wait if it is still strengthening from the first," states the SG Coach.
In order to return to the success request, the Malmon team must be increased in comparison with the past events.
Before all things in the decking work and at the switch game, it was most most vulnerable.
The possibility must also be definitively better.
So I hope my players have finally received the head free during the short pause.
Securities in Mozambique increased in relation to meetings between influential persons
Thousands of people gathered themselves in the Centre of Maputos under the growing eyes of the Statute of Samora Machel, the countryland and the first President of Mozambique, to apply a strange public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, the manager of an investment undertaking.
For fear of the future of the country, she has made her business clothing against a T-shirt with the title "We request security" in Portuguese and has been locked on the Sunday of the quantity on the independence place of the main city.
Since two weeks, there are nearly a day reports on meetings between government forces and Renamo, which count to the worst wars since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was a rebellious movement that began by white governing Rooses and later the party Government of South Africa was supported in the efforts to destabilise the non-dependent Government of the country.
After the Peace Treaty of 1992, she was in an opposition party.
Analysts are not sure that the country will turn back into a growing conflict, but the recent events have been involved in foreign investors and inhabitants.
For the rapid growing economy, it is much in the game, because the detection of large gas conventions in the north-west could bring investments from over 50 billion dollars of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarco from the United States.
The Governing Frelimo Party, since 1975, the dominant power, and Renamo is contradicted to the fault of sprangings.
Renamo said that the Government had conducted the recent meetings by attacking its members in the Province Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The attacks on the past rebelles scanned as government forces attracted and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, declared Renamos Sprecher against the Financial Times.
The Government gives Renamo the crime for the meetings and accuses the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to explore thoughts about an instability.
In accordance with the AFP, the French News Agency, he said on Middle Wednesday, that Dhlakama considered himself as "perder" who wants to use all his remaining powers to prove that he can exceed the government’s decisions.
Even Frelimo and Renamo suggest that they want to deny a war.
However, the thoughts have been taken since Mazanga had been quoted with the words, Renamo gave the peace agreement of 1992.
In accordance with the FT, he explained that Frelimo has not more respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to retreat negotiations and even seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous conversations between the parties have only contributed to springs which have been income by a number of meetings in this year.
“We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collect the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, dozens at the Open University and the Mozambique Expert.
No one of them is good in negotiating and no one is ready to make the necessary circumstances.
Renamo, which has already explained the election reforms, she will cook the community choices in November.
The elections of the President and Parliament are planned for the next year.
Some commenters have interpreted the use of violence as the trying of a pressing movement, to ensure circumstances and financial benefits of the Government.
Renamos Wahler orders have been broken since 1992, while a new party based on a Democratic Moviment de Mozambique (MDM) will probably be improved by the elections.
Mazanga says that Guebuza – its return when his second office time ends in the next year – to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want more party democracy, he doesn't want transparency choices, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give the President's officer," says Mazanga.
It is unknown about what capacity Renamo has been available, but she has raised a hurrying attack on policies and vehicles on a major north-south-sud connections.
Most of the fighters found in the Province Sofala instead of some hundreds of kilometres north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the hair, the mountain building companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export cool.
In June Rio a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the street.
Mazanga answers back to the question whether Renamo will be repeated this drug.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good, ” said Mazanga.
The instability has still increased the Frustration on Government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already worried about corruption, the worst progress in development and a recent implementation.
"The people think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and he should be the one who finds solutions for the problems."
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
“Nobody interests Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful streets again," he explained.
Children should be taught Mythen and Legends as “formals for life”, a author.
The story of Thor showed that “brutal power has no chance against clear tricks” and the artus legendes demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of myths are “being so low, too low, too hard, and in some cases to be learned in schools” because Crossley-Holland planned for a“whole choice” old works.
"I find wonderful that in America Mythen and Folklore are already part of education," he said.
I proposed this as a plan since 20 years ago.
He added to the authors and teachers who were “extremely didactic”, the children would be disabled to cut off the “complete” because the message would be delivered in the subject story.
Crossley-Holland, the Beowulf from the Angel Saxes and the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "Man can follow certain views, but you should keep them in the background."
The biggest difference between a adult author who writes for adults, and a author who writes for children is in the need to distribute hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense for good and evil.
This must be subsequently demonstrated by the history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling it.

Accessor must be in prison
By exchange of human trade, additives, suffering, guidance and dangerous body pollution, the agricultural constance has judged a 33-year-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-minute-year-year-old.
The former agreement soldat, which worked after two assets in Afghanistan as a tourist, has made an understanding in the framework of a process.
However, he learned in five cases of women about the Internet or the phone contacts that he sent after a few weeks against their will on the street.
Resistance was able to break with violence and threats.
He maintained the income of women who made for him a part of years.
Confishing phones and SIM cards, he understood women's contacts for the outside world.
With a colleague who delivered the women, he brought them into various bodies in southwest.
There he left them in part to control their income.
First, before the Court, the advocate said that he had suffered under a serious triumph after colleagues in Afghanistan came near him at a explosion.
After a psychiatric expert, great doubt in psychiatric restriction and thus increasing sinfulness, the 33-year - year - old age was a restrictive conscience.
The court had no longer to understand the wounded women.
As a Cripo employer reported, the first indicator of telephone monitoring measures could be detected at least four other cases of exhaust human trade.
The audited conversations had been made by high agression.
In later authorisations, the guests had confirmed their martyrium.
Another witness that one of the women had discovered the blue flowers in the whole body has not made any exhibition until today.
It handles about "a completely broken person", the violence and expression in this meter as normal.
The accommodator felt his behavior yesterday.
"He's solved out of these circles and wanted to lead a whole normal life after the weight," he said.
Oil price continues to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price is also continuously falled on the free day after concerns about a high offer, which increases the energy-reaching sector of China.
The reference rounds for deliveries in December were cut off 14 cents to 96,24 USD per Barrel at the electronic trade in New York Mercantie Exchange.
The Treaty falled for 39 cents on the Sunday, which means a price consumption of 5,8 per cent in October.
The Great Rohelangebot has loaded the price in the past weeks.
The Energy Ministry of the United States explained on Middle Wednesday that the US offer has taken $4,1 million Barrel last week.
In five weeks, the offer was increased for 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports on an activity in the Chinese fertilization have been indicated to stronger questions.
This indicates a continued increase in China's economy, which increased at 7,8 per cent in the third quarter after it was added to the previous quarter at the lowest position since two decades.
Roh oil from the type Brent, a reference value for international roh oil, also used by American Raffineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to 108,58 USD per Barrel.
Court blocked decision to the NYPD's stop and frask direction
A Court of Office in the United States, on Sunday,, blocked the order of a judge, which requested the amendments in the New Yorker Police Parts, and the jurisdiction of the case.
The 2th U.S. Court explained that the decisions by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be taken until the city's call would be decided.
The judge was judged in August that the city was denied against the conformity of the type and way as to implement the programme for maintaining and demands of persons.
The city has made a call against their evaluation and the adjusted aid measures, including the decision to establish a monitoring station to support the police in amending its Directive and the appropriate education programme.
The Executive Court heard the arguments for the required implementation on the Sunday.
The employment report explained that the judge should be disconnected from the case because they had violated the Treaty Codex for American judges, which is determined that a judge should deny the aspect of the party; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public explanations in which they were openly reacted to the crisis of the Court.
The judge was judged, the police officers destroyed the citizens' rights of ten thousands of people because they were inadequately designed by black and Latin American men with the stop and Friss program.
She invited a external position to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in Directives, training and service monitoring, and organized a pilot program with cameras carried out on the body in fourth places where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was ready to finish the practice of saving names and addresses of persons who were released after a control by the police.
A municipal negotiation for the call of the city was planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-fresh tactics was criticized by a number of citizens' violations.
The controls of this type have been in various forms, but the number of controls recorded during the office of the party citizens Michael Bloomberg at a total height of 684.330 in 2011, most of them are black and late American men.
In 2004, four men who listen to all minorities were attached to a collection.
Forbidding changes in the NYPD, the changes will be completed without practical practices and make a more confidential and effective policy and influence the type and way as other policy regulations.
In fact, the changes would deploy the police moral, but not the criminality; even the money would lose, and the larger problem of a police, which would not resolve thousands of officers in the last decade.
The judge said that they did not end the stop-and-fresh phraxy, which is reasonable, but only the type of implementation of controls through the NYPD.
Happy of the dreaming camele
Happy is a oase to get only dry chambers
The first President Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the Treaty 'Help Mans'.
At Samstagnach's day, the tenth birthday of the Treaty, which has already been able to demonstrate significant success.
The first Chairman has reported detailed the work of the Treaty.
He was the first time in Mauretania in Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
In the consequence, a further cooperation was developed, and the Gynechological Henne led along with several traveling operations.
While the talks were shown pictures of the insects on a large branch, so that the guests of the Jubilee Agreement could make a picture of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the Treaty was also shown.
It is a married front protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the ancient OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to carry out this vehicle with a photovoltacy layout and now plants, according to the agreement in a rating function.
In 2008, the Zimeri Sleeve from Bairs Sources in the record time of a week, the hospital station in Socogim, made a milesty quarter on the border of the main city.
He also mentioned a new mother-kind hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in time in which the birth clinic should be reduced in Nagold.
You learn a lot of learning in Africa as medicine, such as Henne, for example, deployment against Burn-out.
Because of the political challenges in the country, many traveling as planned, but for that many medicines came to Germany to be hospitalized in various areas.
Furthermore, regular contents are sent to Africa with material, so in March this year medical devices, medicals, connection materials, hospitals and brills.
Initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local collarite, reporting from Mauretania by the mobile cycle number of Mercedes vehicles, and the results of the trimheimers musicians, which supported the United Kingdom traditionally by their Mauretanian road.
As his personal movements, he called his work in the field of account testing as a young director.
When he was clear, how much money was lost through the way, he decided to help the Africans in control of a budget through the people.
Furthermore, the global economy also requires global human life.
Nothing should be forgotten that Africa is closer than some.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson set phone hacking for checking a tip
The previous News of the Word-Heer Expressor Andy Coulson made an opportunity to “Telefon-Hacking, Monitoring and Confrontation” when trying to confirm a false tip on an affair of the inner Minister Charles Clarke.
State lawyer Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 a false rebellion that Clarke had a relationship with his “atractive specialberaterin” Hannah Pawlby.
The magazine invited the Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the judgment occurred.
“It is Coulson, who now is the producer of the needW, who is no one who stands before the house of people and hopes to get them to fresh fact, but one who likes people to confront with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW uses three procedures to investigate history: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The manufacturer is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows of the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
How does it look like the first?
He knows about the phone hacking report?
He turns away, but we say: "And if he knew it."
Records of an Affair Clarkes were first taken by the Feature Redaction of NotW as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: "Don't take your time, she is with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three places was ensuring in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The officers also found entries on the computer of the detective, on Pawlby and their sisters were stored as "projects".
At the time, when the research was running, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
On the other hand, Neville Thurlbeck and the previous reporter James Weatherup observed the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a votemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow about what I want to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important persons, such as the former Minister David Blonkett.
The marriages heard that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a case with a married woman when he himself had been licensed with Rebekah Brooks, who had been married once.
Coulson and Brooks are fighting to cut off the phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned resource control, the French Fussball will actually travel the first street since 1972.
A slightstream is unexpected to end.
In the conflict on the river control, the Government and the Professional Fossball in France have been raised after a successful smoking train in a sack gas.
President François Hollande accepted, therefore, on Thursday, in Paris Elisée-Palast of the United and Verband representative, and also heard of their issues.
However, he refused to solve the fusball from the planned 75 per cent income from more than a million euro per year, which all the country company should pay two years since 2014.
The side also remained hard.
The track preached for the end of November will also be tracked, the captain of the profile clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared with.
The day of playing in line 1 and Ligue 2 is therefore expired between 29 November and 2 December.
Getting: no absolute protection possible
"We want to attach the inhabitants early in the planning," opened Mr. Jens Houses, the burgers' information facility for high water protection concept in Geekens.
Arose 80 participants came to the community room to explain the planned measures to ask questions to introduce external and ideas.
The chairman claimed: "The final decisions fall by the members of the Common Council."
The highwater, which was in preparation on May 15, 2009, was an unprepared event that issued on protection measures for the future, so the householder.
A aircraft investigation was given by the neighborhood Aidlingen, which is now based on the high-water protection concept.
"The protection is most possible for many built-based baskets is the goal," so the householders.
It is based on the planning of protection before a loud German meteorological service statistically expecting highwater for 100 years.
The change of climate is taken into account by a 15% contribution.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masks that led in the 2009-year-old diseases were called a 1000-year-year-water high water.
"A absolute protection doesn't exist, but a relative improvement we can get," the householders.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100a climates, it is necessary to be invested around four million euros, which can calculate the communities with landscapes at about 70 percent.
However, the captains say that it is only given to help if a total concept is used.
That is why the community has been shown on the involvement of the citizens.
A sustainable planning and authorisation procedure should be resolved.
In the best case, 2016 may be started with the implementation.
On the other hand, the protection concept that has already been presented in the community Council (We have reported) local measures in the influence of the flow Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
In addition to the presentation of the high-water protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to introduce their requests.
On the other hand, it was issued why no longer was planned to protect the location.
Gregor Künn, the Fachplaner of the employed engineer offices Wald and Corbe from Hagelsheim, who presented the concept, noted that it needs the collection of all proposed measures to get the desired goal in the sum.
Furthermore, you have to maintain the most economic solution, so Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
Unfortunately reached by the managers of the Althood, who are still in the normal driving driving again under a translation of the channel network.
The problem is recognized by the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, the chairman is that the channel systems are other than for high water protection and that should not be lost.
The community is obligated to make the channel network so that two-to three-year regeneration events may be strengthened.
Increasing the water channels, millions would disappear.
Deeply lossed after convention
At the first Friday, the 44th street of Revensdorf was severely lost by two vehicles in a frantal summary.
The police locked the streets immediately, but he could first say little to the accident.
However, there are various witnesses that should only be evaluated.
The 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW golf went out in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man out of Gett death came to her Hyundai.
Both vehicles joined together, where the woman was so hard income that the firewall needed a half hour to deliver them out of the vehicle.
The real accident cause was first unexpected.
Both disappointment came near hospitals.
The street remained at about two hours locked.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a godsucker, a metaphysiker, his Romans and his statements also have something serious.
Combined the relationship in the outside: the smoking eyes, the bart, the high skins.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive work as a heritage and apologet of Russian soul, Philip K. Dick reads as American prophets, which applies something in their own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heine Flag, the Haffman's casset with 118 statements are distributed to two thousand.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of the technical progress that is paid to Paranoia, Security, and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had the results of God’s life, his later books read as a mixing from the opening of John and a computer-manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, he had drugs in the brain.
He's captured, early, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer's theology and asked what a person separates from a machine, the Creator of his creation.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killer.
A master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His story inspired film records such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderity Report" is from 1956, he broke the rod of the Old War and the McCarthy-Tribunale.
It will be developed here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", so what is between more or less official doctrine of the white house.
In the Dicks world, which is like our horrible, looks mutants in the future - and the police runs.
"We have detected individuals who have violated no law," says the captain of the Authority.
"We shoot them, even before they can come to a violent crime."
And: "In our company there is no several crimes, for which we have a strafficer full of pestilence." They read time streams.
They take that it happens, and stop criminal thinking to be implemented in the fact.
Dicks statement works as the blue break for the anti-terror stage and the NSA's absorption.
Anticipation of the proposal: So also works Obamas Drogen philosophy and -praxis.
But Dick's story isn't over.
The policeman claimed that there is no guarantee any more, the military controls the whole day and what remains from the State.
Then the supervisor will be overseered and transmitting a future crime.
The system turns.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It finds its own conditions.
Take mistakes and sacrifices not only in buying, but build yourself on it.
The system makes the danger that fights it.
Philip K. Dick's reading means always again to come closer to the truth.
Exposure on Market in Russia
The ancient US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make out in his Russian asyl asylum in the United States Snowden officers about the Office of Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the Dutch Agency may have written questions or the 30-year-olds also have been in Russia, reported the Interfax Agent.
First, the Green Buddhag Hans-Christian Ströbele had occurred last night as the first German Snowden Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affairs.
NSA distributions strengthening company paranoia for State monitoring
At a late day, the end of August, a German police smoker was deeply over the US Consulat in Frankfurt on Main, the Financial City of Germany.
On the indication of the Budget for Conservation and terrorism fight (BVT), of the German Secret Service, he should photograph the board of the US outcome, which is less than 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Budget Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to show the presence of overseers and the action led to a word change between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, American Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States did not apply the opportunities of the foreign spioneage to “avoid the business secrets of foreign companies in order to build their international competition or their winnings.”
However, since Edward Snowden, who became a single cooperator to the Whistleblower, with the publication of his full horn in American monitoring secrets, European governments and undertakings are no longer sure if they can take the Director in the word.
Reports where the American National Security Agency spends the Brazilian Oil Company Petrobas and has obtained data from American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company paranoia have brought up to a new maximum status.
The fass for the transition took the enthusiasm that Kanzler Angela Merkels phone was blown, perhaps ten years ago.
If the powerful person in Europe can be invisible, there are also potential objectives of enterprise.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and enterprises transparency.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for contrast use.
“The Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Green, President of the BITMI, which is the small and average IT-firms in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States have now made the same risk as China when it goes to industry pioneering and data degree, a question published in July by the EC Council company.
However, in the documents transmitted by Snowden, there was no doubt that the United States had delivered operating secrets to their own companies.
Politicals have concerned that the EU has missed certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce their dependence from the United States.
The companies are increasingly skeptical.
The contract was proposed, we should build a German Google.
I can just shut my eyes and open them soon...
“It doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you would want a strong European IT industry, you would not have to let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subventioned from the coal of cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT bank.
However, rich and technical raffiness of the US-Spion Offices covered by the Snow Companys, which previously have seen the greatest spionage risk in China.
In Cloud Computing, there is a big change, since the European business leaders are now sure that the data that are stored in the United States are undertaken and therefore are dangerous.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade Institute, which has been carried out by the interviews on American data mining activities with a price at about ten percent of the non-existent Member States plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, representative employer of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who haven't given it a year ago – she says: Where will my data be saved and you can ensure that this physical remains in this law room?"
Many German undertaking leaders represent the view that recent reports only confirm what they already knew that the powerful States want their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be observed for each price.
It is not surprising that the economic spionage is found.
That's all right.
“It was a subject for many years and has not changed by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, President of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spending us on commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to protect our companies.
The implementation of the company is usually not concerned about the measures that have been adopted, because it provides the benefits of suppliers.
In large companies, the companies have been a long term that the companies of an uncostless USB sticks are not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fix a laptop in the hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberk, office member of Audi car producer, says that it has been listed for years to standard practice, to collect the phones in order that they can not be used as an auditory equipment.
The German BVT provides guidance forces to use easy prepaid hands if they go to foreign travels because smartphones may be comprometed.
The Prepaid Handys will be removed back.
However, it is concerned that small and mediterraneous companies remain attractive to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the EU.
“It is often missing experience, personal and financial resources to protect employment secrets effectively against non-autorised access,” states the BVT in a report.
The United States warn their own companys before economic spiones through other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate was in February in France, Russia and Israel behind China at the range of two of the countries who served to maintain economic data of the hacking.
A member of a German Blue Chip undertaking was to be subject to the economic spionage, then “besides the most worst français”.
Bernard Squarcini, ancient leader of the French internal service DCRL, has been quoted in an interview with the following words: “The secret services are very well known that all countries, even if they cooperate in fight against the terror, they spread their relations.”

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in death
The parents of the Teenager, whose body was found in a joined ringermate in the tourn hall of his high school, were convinced that her son was killed, explained the family's lawyer on the Sunday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in the United States of Georgia, was found on 11 January in a receipt matte, which stood behind the tribs in the school Hall.
The research officers of the officer of Lowndes County came to conclude that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year.
“They are convinced that their son was killed,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They had never believed that he died as the sheriff had finished.
“They are considering that it is all logic, against the laws of physical, as well as against the healthy human understanding,” says Crump.
Moreover, they are convinced that the truth will be defended to protect persons or persons who are responsible for the death of their son.
“ His son went to learn in the school and returned to the body sack,” he commented.
The US lawyer Michael Moore said on Sunday, it will be given a formal report to the death of Johnson, since a number of important questions are still unexpected.
What was the death cause?
Is his death to return to a crime?
This explained Moore at a press conference on the Sunday.
I follow the facts in which they also lead.
My goal is to find the truth.
“I am representing the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a formal remediation,” he said.
Moore explained reporters that the initial autopsie stated that Johnson was dead in the consequences of a “positive conditional raising”.
However, a second autopsie has caused another death cause, so Moore.
“ There is a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to the death of Johnson, he will apply the FBI with the implementation of the removals.
A representative of the Court of Sheriffs was not immediately prepared for a comment on our request on Sunday.
A Court in South Georgia ordered on midnight that the authorities should free all monitoring videos which have checked the officers.
The parents of the Teenager said that they hoped that the video recording indications were inspired by how he was dead.

These are the first Directives that the United States Government has issued, since the number of educated children with food algebras is increased.
One of 20 children in the United States has a food algebra.
The broadcast of food algebras under children has adopted CDC between 1997 and 2007 for 18 percent.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should achieve awareness for food algebra and how to go to children to show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that the schools of Epinephrin have preliminary – the auto-injection of the EpiPen mark will be used most often – to match a potential mortal reaction.
Legislators in the Contracting States recently have changed the rules to facilitate Epinephrin schools.
In the report, there is also a list of typical symptoms called by children who demonstrate a allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something pressed on my tongue," "My tongue feels as if a hair is on it" or "My tongue's smoking."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “general indefinite”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children who were born with non-explicit genitalia.
Renewing is not more aware of man or fair.
After the new law, parents have no generation to explain for such children, but they may be “indetermined” or“not established” in the birth source.
The objective of the law is to take the pressure of parents to not be taken with respect to operations in relation to new births, and to fight discrimination of intersexual people.
A intersexual person says BBC years later: "I am no man or woman."
I remain the fishing work that was created by doctors, cutting and full narrows.
It is estimated that one of the two thousand children are not as a boy or a girl in the world every year.
They are of the intersexual, a group that falls under the diagnosis of sexual difference (DSD), a collection of people with atypic chromosomes, chemicals (prims or heads) or unlikely developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersexual.
The understanding of the generation identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States are considered that you should use the best available information for adults if a definition is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and corporate development of the child before you decide – if you decide – for a operation.
The New Yorker Psychiater Dr. Jack Drecher, who has specialized the problem of the generator identification, said that the new German law “little after a good thing”.
Intersexual children give a ethical dilemma.
“Mans have living diseases that require a chirurg infringement, but for most children it doesn't apply," said he.
You can take a family indication without operation and then expect how identity is developed.
The scientific data about how a child has developed his criminal identity are not very exactly.
Nobody knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret, why people are homosexual.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011, intersexual people are to be different from transsexual or transsexual persons, because their status is not fair, but by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or weird, but typically both identifying or not clear as one of them.
These properties were shown in a positive sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, behaviour, breasts and stage, preceding sexual characteristics such as formal planning organs and genitalies, or in cromosomic structures and hormones.
The report also provides a survey of discrimination that sees intersexual and transsensitive persons in the employment life, as well as the exceeding detention, violence and prejudice criminality.
Not with the generator's image, they have a special camp now.
It is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate official documents, a person or a “the third generation”.
In June, Australia Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “perfectless” person in the world, after a judge had accepted the long-term holding of a“no-defined” family status.
German indications have near M and W in the future a third indication, X for intersexual, so the internal ministry.
In France used, families are still controvers, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, twelve French Parliament of the Serious Catholic country signed a petition that the “general theory” should be removed from school books.
The US-American website Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, with the confession: “When the world is destroyed in a new state where the community has made a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distract two more columns of civilization.”
The mother of a new birth of Maryland explained about the baby Zone, she found it better if babys were admitted to a generation.
“The parents also have no more limits, especially if you don’t know the family of their own child, ” said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically seen children who were born with men and born families, named Hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God, who had both tribes.
Ten years ago, the medicine considered the generation as something you could remove and then rebuild.
However, the ethical principles of an operation will be indicated after the fact that the complex is the legal identity, and that doctors can also be wrong because they don't know how the child feels when they grow up with the family associated with them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric accident”, said Drecher.
When a child was born, you would not call the psychiater, but the chirurg.
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with unbelievable Gentility is returned to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who declares the view that the community is formable.
He announced the term “law identity” and argumented, social and environmental advantages – as parents get a child – interacted with the Genes and Hormones of a child and preached whether a person was a man or a man.
However, in one of the titles “John/Joan” in 1966, his theories were convinced.
He invited the parents of a young child who had been disappointed in a ransom disorder, to catch the child completely and also remove his heads and then put him up as a girl.
“Monney presented this case as a successful example for a conversion that he was not," so Drecher.
When the boy was about 15, he turned back to a husband and married a woman.
But with 38 he began to kill himself.
According to Drewers, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the Internet access, the survivors of these generation operations have been attached to the public that “not happy to the result.”
Even with Jim Bruce, an 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY men's chromosomes, but two-divine Gentilians.
The doctors were not clear if he had a big clitical or a small penis and had been convinced that he could never lead a “friendly life ” as a man.
So his external body and the heads were shortly removed after the birth of 1976, and he was grown as girls.
In the age of 12, he received vital hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
In the age of 18, he should have a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressive and knew that something was wrong, he asked his medical acts.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth - and no one told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that could not produce enough teststrone to develop Genitalians.
After he discovered the truth, he turned back to a man's identity, received teststron injections and removed his breasts.
By the operation, he became unfruitful.
Today he fights for others in an organization named the Interface Project that intersexual people are normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, employer of the Advocates for Informed Choice in California, is concerned that the German law can “for absent temperatures and stigmatization”.
“A lot of activities are concerned that the German decision may encourage parents to take quick decisions and to show to the child a not defined”, explained.
We're afraid that it's a beneficiary intervention.
We think it would be better to show the men or sexual generation and then wait.
However, we don't even know how the law affects, so we can just spread.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian Law, because it “allows adults the recognition as a third generation”.
“The adults should be able to take their own decisions about their legal generation,” she explained.
The German law is about the indication of the birth.
It's not a fight that you should kids at this time.
If they are grown, they can decide on their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a brestradiologist of Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual difference, and some hundreds of others in a self-aid group, says that the German law “complete” as well as parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with men's chromosomes, but a DSD namedly completely an Androgen resistance.
According to the recipe effects of the target cells for testestron, Katie developed virtual characteristics.
She has a vagina, but there's no outerus and no eggs.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a worker in the child psychiatry.
Although she is unfruitable, she hopes, however, to get a child by adoption or a mother of life.
“The law gives parents a room where they do not have to take decisions,” said Baratz.
The time to make various tests and explain things and give them the time before they write “man ” or“with ”.
In this way, everything is all right – you get the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoys the age.
And you don't have to take an operation that can't be rejected.
“This ends the children in the decision and disturbs the fear that parents lose because they are thinking they would not do the right,” she explained.
Lastly, the child decides about the generation that is better to him – and it is wonderful.
Thus, children will be transmitted in the situation to take decision itself.
Unknown dead girls by shoes out of the car
Unknown in the shoes of a car was a twelve-year-year-old saxen-containment.
The tattoos were probably struck on a group of children in Genthin in the donner station.
This shared the police in Burg.
The girl was easy in the left Wade.
Saving forces brought the girl into the hospital.
The shoes came out of a small car, which was a group of six children and stopped immediately.
The witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The tattoos also rolled into a bus.
A shooter broke.
Then they went out of it.
The crime policy found it on free.
Before this time, the police spectrum can look back to a quiet hallwee night.
The officers were only twice called to be able to be proud of children who struck them against households.
Since the householders recognized this rightly and the eggs were remotely, they should not be able to be achieved.
Moreover, some Sylvester bealers were also designed in the field of the city, but there is no case.
An inhabitant in Bisof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his Pkw was developed with Klopapier and was used by the radios.
However, before the police entertainment, the man has discovered his advice in directly close to all, why the police should not continue to work.
Works with future perspective
Waraud Ries really lives soumic.
Your house is in a quiet holiday of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree file, net neighbors and not even a lot of transport.
There are only few minutes in the city with public transport.
"Do you hope you have no fear of springs?", asked Waraud Ries and shows a fixed spin in the door.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me since some time.
But you know how hard it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spinphone, but the worry, in the age, the many training levels of house and in the room are no longer able to explore it.
Furthermore: Since a Menicus operation, the middle fifty-fifty-fifty in his own body, what means to move with the handicap from Stockwork to Stockwork.
Before shortly, a book of her appears to the theme 'happy live in the age - What is the best room for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what's not going in the age," begins to tell them.
When she went with her husband over 20 years ago to the Houseonette apartment, it was just a beautiful room in the middle of Green.
Today, with the middle of 50, Waraud Ries thinks otherwise about it.
However, she knows that she hears the few people who are exceedingly distracted with the theme 'Women in the age'.
Most of them disappear it while it's going.
The old will always be just the others, says they're crazy.
First when the painful pressure is really great, think.
'But it can be too late,' so ries.
In its book, the internal architectin provides 17 resident models for a self-determined residence in the age.
"What kind of lives you choose is always a individual decision," explains it.
D i e solution doesn't give it for the age.
Even if anyone can lead to the age in the Toscana or the Britannica, he should always be surprised that he can also be sick.
And: "No good knowledge of the country language, you also join in Dolce Vita," the manufacturer of the writer's exhibition.
In their models, classic treatment models, alternative resident forms or often citated rentner WG.
In the age, everybody has his tickets and shoes
"For me it would be such a home community, but nothing," she means with an eye winker.
It's not like in a student-WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
"In the age you just need his back room, so ries."
This can still work for an elderly social society, the manufacturer will not even exclude.
However, it must be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes, you just just want his rest, believe it.
With this opinion, it is not at least in the country's capital.
"The most older people in Stuttgart wants to stay in their own apartment so long," also the experience of Theresa Rotten, the leader of the citizen service life in the age of the country's capital city.
Your service provides people around the "excellent" theme.
That is why older people would also also take unrestrictions and restrictions to remain in their lives, that is also the experience of the certification warrant.
There are many opportunities today to handle the house or the apartment free.
Ries recommends all those who build their home or their apartment with the old-right construction of their home or their apartment to notify themselves only one time, and not the best handmacher.
Today, there are also specialists for the old-right rebuilding.
Even in the district, let it realize one or another, and if it is only the higher toilet, the internal architectin is opened.
However, the existing room is not always allowed to be able to change the age of age and to be free, even if it still is so beautiful.
This experience had to do Wraud Ries.
However, you could install a trip lift inside the room, which is also planted by traveling the way to the room, but it would be a bigger limit.
She will continue until she found the ideal object for himself and her husband.
Before the aircraft, she's more than the spin in her apartment.
United States wants to continue to persecute Snows
The United States have not changed their maintenance to the previous US secretary employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to propose that he has given unlimited secret information.
Therefore, he needed to make himself a criminal procedure in the United States, said the speaker of the US Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even the recent expressions of Snowden would have changed nothing.
Before the German Green Political Hans-Christian Ströbel after a meeting with Snowds in Moscow, the United States called to not be punished with crime.
The Psaki stated that it had been acting in stretch exemptions about a Parliamentary, and not on a German government member.
The secret service staff Edward Snowden is basically prepared for a conversation with German authorities.
But first he wants to know his situation.
This has cleared the former NSA employees in a non-reported writing that the Green Politics Hans Christian Ströbels were published on free day after a meeting with Snowd and leaded to the Bunds Government, Agreement Day and General Assembly.
The write has been extended after a translation of Strubelle:
For the competents
I was requested to write you about your investigation on massage monitoring.
I'm Edward Joseph Snowden, and I was employed forwardly or directly as a technical expert in the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In my employment in these institutions, I was a witness of the systematic laws of my Government, which have left me from moral obligation to trade.
As the result of the publication of these thoughts, I saw me a serious and stopped threats, who deceived me to leave my family and my home.
I now live in the exil, and joyfully satisfied asyl, which gives me the Russian Federation according to international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political trade, both in the United States and in different ways.
Citizens in the world and also high officers - including the United States - have made the payments to a system of allocated monitoring that no account is worthy of a public service.
These spionage fulfillments have made a lot of proposals to new laws and directives, which have rejected the use of public confidence before.
The benefits for the society of these guaranteed recognitions will be very clearly; the risks taken in the same time have been clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was positive, my Government treats this way as faithful, and then trys to criminalize political opinions and to put into account.
However, to speak the truth is no crime.
I am convinced that the Government of the United States with support of the international community will decline this absorption.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are contributed, I will be in the way to participate in the responsible statement of the matters related to the issues held in the media, in particular in view of the truth and the authenticity of the reports.
I'm glad to talk to you in your country when the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to make the international right that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans Christian Ströbel
Child Garten found a private coffee
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingens citizens Michael Maier.
The old child garden in the garden street, the community sold a private person.
The sale was referred to in his recent meeting in a non-public part.
The building changed his owner to a "acceptable" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
In the budget, there were 100 000 euros.
It is still not clear how the new owner wants to use the previous children's gardens.
The citizen master is right that Winterling has delivered the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else, and therefore no longer needs to get up for the conversation of the house, as to look after the garden and to smooth the way.
"This ship is gone now," makes it pleasure.
Space concerts at higher temperatures
The musician Hammersbach provides a located concert on the terrace of the Gast House Hammer.

Some 50 audiences enjoyed the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The President Manuela Honeck explains the music sticks.
Honeck thanked in this framework all those who had helped to fulfill the first music hock successfully.
Report: Obama campaign transferred to replace requests by Hillary Clinton
The most comfortable advisers of President Barack Obama have submitted in secret the Vice-President Joe Biden to replace Hillary Clinton in the election campaign 2012, so the New York Times.
The enthusiasm is the most precious surprise of the long-term work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the election fight 2012, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times provides an example of the first appearing book, and it reported on the Donner Stagend that the president's superintendent would have been carried out “a large group meetings and reviews in the end of 2011” to find whether it would be a hard hope for Obamas to re-early choose better if he falls in prayers.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Corresponder of the Times, the book shows the story of the campaign and the white house, namely the Previous White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, which effects have affected it on the review of the ex-minister Clinton against the Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was a strict secret secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only a half thousand of the latter counselors of the President, including Daley, the former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and the previous leader of the white house, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the proposed change.
In "Duble Down", Daley has been at the point of efforts to exceed their “in private relationships”, while you finally decided against such a shift, after the data showed that Clinton's candidate would not be able to improve the opportunities of Obamas.
In a interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the Government had actually overcome the requests by Clinton.
“ I expressed a whole number of things that should be considered, and that was one of them, ” explained Daley to the Magazine.
We need to remember that the President had a fearful question, so we thought, “What do we do to God’s will?”
While Daley named the investigations as “provided Sorgfalt”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign was operated for the recovery of a significant exploitation to find whether such currency was paid in the view of the elections.
“In the campaigns, it is not so much money for consultations and focus groups if you are not seriously considering anything,” said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team was looking at an exchange.
Martin said about CNN, he asked Daley if his boss knew about the potential change.
While Daley explained that he didn't believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the previous stab team gave that it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
Martin added that "Double Down" does not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political supply of Obamas would have obtained a desktop.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama didn't know anything of the investigations about whether prayers should fall at the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Would it be used in the design of the Internet e-mail as technically in the coming mail?
In the concept of the previous Internet services, it was in the presence of communicating.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols were not considered to create a fixed fund for an audit change.
That is why an open mail is more than a open mail card than a posted letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of both then directly connected?
The e-mail program or the Anna browser first sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, the Google would be.
This mail server sends the content to the provider used to Benni.
On the stream, the mail can run over some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Do you read future e-mails on their way through the network?
Most mails will be read by multiple software robots.
In the manufacturer of the sender, the e-mail is regularly checked on whether an appliance is carried out as an annex.
On the recipient systems, there is also a virus check.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is a fair and unexpected spam mail that is deleted or at least removed in a spam directory.
Do the robots have another job?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also provides the information that Google needs to locate context view.
If you communicate Anna and Benni per GMail about their coming travel, Google can hide the corresponding links to the offers.
Read unknown people the emails?
The probability that unacceptable people read a mail is extremely small.
Theoretical is, but this is possible.
In companies, the administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
In addition, the crime persecution authorities and secret services have legal opportunities to receive e-mails or to recognize.
There are possible illegal expenditure actions.
Is it possible to protect emails against the mailing?
With a encryption after the OpenPGP standard, an email can be efficiently encrypted against mailing.
With high technology, it is also possible to distribute the metadata of an email communication, so that it can not be recognised without any further who has communicated.
How important is Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
In the mainly used mail boxers, Yahoo and Google plays a study of Convios Consulting from August 2013 only a subordinated role.
While the participation of Yahoo mail was recently fallen, GMail was clearly able to create GMail from Google.
Mother in the wood broken and ringed
When his beauty mother died, a man from Wolfsburg shot a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continuing to catch their reward and payment.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger entered his dead mother after the police remediations in the forest.
First, he lost the death of 89 years, then he put the money more than a half years.
Now, the 67-year-old has to be responsible for the fighting, as a writer on the Friday said.
However, the husband hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man has already been condemned in May: soon, it has not been needed any more medicine for the needed mother.
The manager told the rentner that his mother was going to Spain.
Because the officers did this wonderfully, they continued to discover.
It came out that both of them lived in a joint room for more than 15 years and he finally made them.
The 67-year-old has finally put the death of his mother.
A training has been made by the police no rate points for a capital crime.
Do you like the eiscreme that lights in the dark?
A British companier has developed the first light ice in the darkness – with the help of Callen.
Charlie Francis used the fluoresceous properties of the sea streets and produced a lighter leckery.
The idea came to him after reading a research work on Callen and persuaded Chinese scientists to produce the light protein artificially.
The Eiscreme reacts when the language is broken by the pH value in the protein and the light is released.
Chris explains that food reacts to the heats in the mouth and light – so you're going to smoke, so it's better.
Charlie, greeners of the Eiscreme company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 £."
The protein used in the eiscreme reacts with the language at a neutral pH value.
If the mouth has the protein, the pH value and the ice lights.
We have done it in the past months, and it appeared perfectly to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the worst icecreme I've ever produced, because the calle light material is four times more torder than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's nice for that.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is joyful for their unregular shipping facilities that are beer, cups, ring meat and flat gold.
However, his latest creation must be more ambitious.
He says: "I want to develop an invisible icecrema."
This is, and it is impossible for himself because of the light breakfast which will be carried out by the East Crisis, from which the icecrame exists, but I suspect that we find an opportunity to create it.
The Eiscreme uses the fluoresceous properties of a calle produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is after six games days still without any point in the handball connection.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverds, who held his first trip on the past weekend.
With this game the saison starts again for us.
"I hope that we finally have the head free," the edge is optimistic.
Finally, with exception of the long-term Henrik Blohme, his complete box is available.
Daverden also puts as we are on time games.
That is why we need to keep our mistakes small.
However, in the first line, it is to increase in the decking, which last has left all other than a safe impression.
Unfortunately, Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz, after the first saison side against Northhorn.
Of course, the game was a home number.
But that's why we're not long for the favorite, because in Derby it can always happen.
Likewise, I want Panitz to go to Morsum to start a series.
I missed Jan-Malte Jodad.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windspot, which is active with double game rights at the A-Young-Bremen HC Bremen.
Whoever is not hot in such a game, let's stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I had to eat sweetness, stay afterwards and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today, I've been more like Hallowee-moffel.
In the past two years, I didn't explain that I was not ready to share from my apartment of shoes, and I wouldn't even do this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep that's at Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be exactly – celebrate the year of Halloween and give the total 6,9 billion dollars for smoothness, cosm and decorations, as the United States-American connection of individuals (NRF).
One thing I'm happy every hallway, then, it's the trend values.
The costs will be carried out at about 1,2 billion of the US $6,9 billion, so the NRF.
In this year, there are unbelievable circumstances of the last voice.
Women have no longer to do sexy clothing, they can also be able to build food, such as Pizza, Hamburger or Carots.
What men do, I expect every lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I know that the Duft-Punk World Works will make it this year in the Instagram Feeds.
According to Google, most studies are zombies, Batman, pirates and hexen.
I'm sure it's nothing wrong to tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year, and it wasn't alone to my surprises.
In fact, the US$330 million in this year for their home animals, such as the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
We are not impressive.
Americans will be exposed for $1.9 billion this year, so the Nisen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of schools, lushers, Bonbons and Gummibbears.
So good news for the United States Manual Ministry 41 million people who travel through the fourth quarter.
In fact, we'll buy over 40 million kilograms of schools for Halloween and – we'll do nothing for us – not eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar Candy Corn's sugar, and then 15 million kilograms will be sold for Hallowee, so the national shipping of the smoking manufacturers.
That's about nine billions of carbons.
It's a threat I couldn't solve.
Nothing more is in Halloween than houses in which it is packed.
You have great names like "Terror behind the Walls" (which remains in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised spuphouse in the United States, which make 500 million dollars solutions, so America Haunts, and that ends the wonderful photos on which you just pink in the house and then put the friends on Facebook where you don't get them again, and then one of the types on which you stand, a comment, like "new face expression".
But we're finally coming to the corbs.
Charlie Brown made us trusted with the great crown when we were children, and the stress of a core latter is like the smoke of the winter tree – something we made from little.
Happyly, the "Baby in Curbis" triangle began last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us have grown to justify the curve and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will be exposed about $106 million for the currency, so the US Census Office.
The currency lanterns that are lately broken in the forest are likely from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of currences have been buried this year.
If you want to correct points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and smooth something nice out of your 921 kilo kilo severe corbs.
Accommodation in the Health Rights: Rettung forces mountains of the bodies
The firewall had to express the poster stage in the helm right.
A triif family house in the landcreis Hof begins night to free fire.
The delivery forces make a selling body from the house.
Saving forces have found a selling body in a trial family house in a brand in Helmbrecht.
Is it still unknown about a resident, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said?
At the last Donner Stage, it was burned in the grounds of the house.
When the fireway entered, the flowers are already struck out of a window.
The entry forces went into the room and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned completely.
The whole earthquake was wounded.
All other inhabitants were not home during the brand, the police speaker further explained.
The building is not inhabitable first.
The exact reason for the fire was not first clear.
The largest country Church in Germany has started a public animal to move for the employment of the pastor.
Background is a possible mantel: The Evangelium-Lutherian Church Hannover is considered that the number of their current 800 pastors and pastors will be half of their current position to 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offered good future views, the Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in conversation with the Evangelistic Presse Service.
It is attractive to determine the work- and day-sabad itself.
With Burfien, the church has first invited a pastor on a full position to make young people for the theological studio.
Today, youths are always decided to study theologies after the abus.
Burfien brings this back to the process of the discovery: "God's voice is empty, the world is loud."
The profession of great freedom and multi-function has been achieved.
I am Mr. of my calendar, and I can put my hard points there where it is important for me.
Pastors may be very close to the people.
They rewarded as many as teachers and could live well.
It will certainly be paid more in the free economy, but the teologist would have a safe worker for that.
This comes to the young people from today who are not only about Carrie, but for their full job.
According to the details of the church, which contains three fourth neighborhoods, currently run around 60 pastors in the rest.
Eventually, about 40 solvents of a theological studio start their vikariat.
In the part of the border areas such as the hart, the Emsland or the Wendeland may be difficult to establish positions in the future.
Burfien wants to work in other study days for young people and also invite prominents who have studied theology.
The theological studio offers a wide education.

Firehouse calls to save a honey, which set 15 meters over the ground on a dangerous steel prevention in a rock break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was sold after a small transport accident
Three days later, she was detected by a spazier in stone break in their missing situation.
Fire drivers fell down in the rock and saved the dog before the safe death.
The firewall was to bring a honey in safety that was set up at a 15 meters high prep in a steel.
The nine months old cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was released after a travel accident on Sunday Mediterranean and survived three days alone before she was delivered from a rock break on midnight.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 who heard of the dog, came to the rock flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank the western Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were disappointed after their missing Hund and published assistance calls in social networks when they were departed after the small trading accident in the rock break.
One at 4:15 at the midnight, a spazier who led out his dog, the smoking Ruby at 15 meters up in the rock break.
The technical delivery team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station went on to the position and went out to save Rubys, which then was transported up in a dogbox.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of the technical reserve team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
She was in the middle of the ship - 15 meters away from above and on the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her saving – she was like smoking.
But now she's okay.
Then she eat a couple of dogs.
It was a very increasing use.
The fact that the dog was detected is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of the technical safe team, said: "Ruby had a rise lying."
It showed the possibility that she was very hard or worse.
Ruby was carried out to investigate, but nothing was set out except creating and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was difficult to see saving.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The animal she explained that if the creation was too large and it would be broken, it would probably be disappeared.
The fire driving leaders have made greatly.
It was really amazing what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firewhile leaders were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.

George Kerevan: European Development gives the choices the choice
A new day, a new crazy story of independentity.
This time we will warn that an independent Scotland is required to contribute to the Schengen room as a condition for the EU membership.
This provides the name of history on pass checks in Berwick and a safe border in the Hadrian Warl.
In fact, in the Strathclyde plan, it was shown to the potential economic benefits that would bring more availability in the rest of Europe, but it had played – expected – there was no role in the shoes.
Nobody also mentioned that the EU Member States are often to adjust their strict rules if it is better for them.
Since Scotland is not currently in the shining room, the continued notice for Brussels would only be a small conscience in the respect of what you really want from the shoots.
So there's no story.
And one who has already come in the years that she has already seen a phossil: the first time I have heard the "independence" enthusiasm of pass controls before at least 40 years.
There is an interesting point in the constant repeating of this regular story.
Why should you wait for an independent Scotland that it is dancing after the European peep?
Why is London's joch in contrast to Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan, after the war, on the basis of the European Union, has been in Stocks.
With Eurocrisis, the European project was officially dead.
In the EU, all parts of the EU will be gathered on the grounds that are in the EU's enemy, or to put the euro as a Community currency on the boat.
Even in Germany, the European Scaptic Partie Alternative for Germany – first this year – a few five million votes in the Treaty Day election in September, and so effectively the free demokrates (equivalent to the British Liberal Democratics) could be raised from the Budget Day.
There has always been a home resistance against the plan to create a federal European.
The current economic crisis, however, comes as a wing point.
Through Berlin and the European Central Bank, severe Spar politics related to the switch jack where the national economy is required by maintaining the common monetary, many people are considered that the European project has been too long.
The Euro's crisis has little to do that national governments are excessive budgetary deficits – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set up its members in changes, which are essential for German exports, and that would like to leave German policies.
Without the possibility of an evaluation of the local monetary, South Europe is reached with an income of productivity in contrast to Germany.
The only opportunity is to cut off the leprosy and public expenditure – referred to by Berlin.
Besides the current state and monetary problems, there is a deep Europe's productive problem.
As the consequences of the “green” energy guidelines adopted by Brussels – a code for the subvention of French and German energy undertakings on the cost of consumers – the European industry pais the double for electricity and the four-flowing for gas.
It's a larger cost part of how we've already seen in Grangamouth.
All the low fish writes of the world protect the European petrochemic industry from beautiful American ship gas in the eggs.
As a result, a revolution, especially in France, the unique Cheer Leader of the EU.
After the war, the Political Elite France saw the EU as a vehicle with Germany in Schach and Paris could have been able to take up with Washington.
However, Berlin does not need Paris more than the door for political legalization and has rejected its own economic policy to fight the French economy intended.
The result: Marine Le Pens Director, the EU-Enemy Front National has just wined a decisive choice, and that the Governing Socialists are in place three.
The Front National is now the most favorable party in France with 24 percent of the electoral votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot go out of it, a column in the right spektrum would automatically mean the price for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its new popularity in the white français of the workers class?
She wants to use the EU choices next year to reduce an anti-EU-, anti-Community-State block in the European Parliament.
If anti-EU-partys have a good decline with these choices, and that is very well possible, then, first a block of such could go to the European Parliament.
This is the point that I want to go out: In the future, the growth of the resistance against the EU and the common monetary of the euro will be joined.
The EU will not be disappeared, but it will be more like the “Europe of the (Swiss) nations” who favored General de Gaule.
Germany and some of its satellite environments may be set at Euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own money.
I hope that the United States are distant from this project in the hope of along with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific room is close to that the United Kingdom is only in the Atlantic rains.
Where's Scotland staying with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (the last consecution) of small-English.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – as well as to say, Berlin and Brussels, what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could be very good in a lockerer European connection if we keep our own money.
The cooperation with others, such as countries thinking, is easier in a non-governmental Europe of the nations.
In addition, we should suggest that it should be equal to Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is noted – the most successful political movement against the Spar policy in Europe and 2011 has been a special majority in the cause of the proposed (and taken) curiosity that had been responsible for the Labour Financial Ministry Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib Dem Coalition.
It would be easy for Scotland to decide now for an independentness only to reach a Spar policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Ancient puberty: Quickly grow
African and Spanish girls are tenderly achieved by the puberty than their white age genes, such as investigations.
Body changes are not directly significant to the puberty
There is no obligation to be responsible for hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe the epidemic fetality is a soldier of the previous puberty
The trend to the previous puberty is less exposed to young people
The previous CNN Correspondentin Pat Etheridge is a journalist who has specialized children’s health and family themes.
Would a mother be worried if her daughter already grows in the age of seven or eight years of breasts and shommers?
In the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early corporate changes were relatively under American girls and represented a new standard.
“I'm a lot of time to break parents – usually it's not a sign that the puberty now comes quickly, ” explained the caplowitz.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, smooth, and ashes, and body smoke, are shown before girls.
However, it was only a light movement in the age of the Menarche (the first rule cluster) in the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age of 12,5 years is less than 12,75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts starts, it is still at least two to three years until the Menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of the book “First Pubertat with girls: the essential rayers to go with this frequency problems.”
The time is the most exact test as the puberty prevents.
It is extremely limited to the beginning of the puberty, but it is applied to the extent of the growth of eight years.
In most cases, the process or stagnises – something that can exactly supervise a child art.
In rapid pre-progress, tests may be shown by an endikronolog, so that serious problems such as tumor or cities may be excluded.
There are treatment methods to reduce an early menstruation and the decline of another consequence: the previous advance of the bones, the ultimized to grow increasing and so small body growth can lead to adults.
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal treatment are orientated at the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional relief.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is retained to the medicine, but he dreams: “The subpressions of the puberty can be treatment problems and the feelings of girls as well as their age.”
The other big problem is obvious: parents wouldn't just want their very young daughters to have the period.
“You are worried about the weakness risk or how they handle the hygiene side," said Caplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter has received ten days.
Even if it had the first sign and we had talked about the Menstruation, she was not prepared.
She came suffering and disturbing from school to home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many surrounded theory about the causes of the early puberty.
However, there is no key evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young guys come like girls before in the puberty.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convinced prices are the epidemia of the fatality.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls in the age of six to nine years, which produced a relationship between the body and the entry into the puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that play a role.
In this country, African and Spanish girls have tendencies more than their white age genes.
There are different statements for this.
Global seems to be influenced by an early puberty of all possible things from economic conditions on climate to the Genesis.
Another review: Although the boys have grown up before, the trend is not as much as the girls.
Other doctors in the AAP Conference subscribe the complexity of the subject.
The upset of acne and shamhaar is expanded by babys and little children.
“We must be careful to identify the real beginning of the puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a medical endocrinology at Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to take care of their children’s arte of how they should talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to lead a conversation before you expected,” said Caplowitz.
If you remain quiet, the child normally reacts well.
The girls who have been deceived early need to ensure that the process is a normal part of life, even if he enters before.
Jumbo-Hestler stretch in view of large sets on the seat width
between leading aircraft manufacturers, it has been made a combination on the width of sites in the tourist class at long-term flows, which offers the sound for a worst cohesion on Dubai Airshow this month.
The battle turns around the length of the seat, which is offered by passors to long flys in the tourist class – not always those who try at most of them, but this designed space is the key for the efficiency events in the new airbus SAS and Boeing Co. dar.
Airbus requested this week a branch standard which provides a length of at least 46 cm (18 dolls) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the air company should decide.
The department is at a time when the aircraft is able to sell more versions of its two-motor travellers and expect records from 17 to 21 November.
As the following part of the aircraft is equipped, especially if there are rows with nine or ten places, it is essential for the given economic results that should provide the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing means that his modernized "777X" fase 406 persons in the tourist class that are wide than 17 dolls and allow 10 per line.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of A350 encourages 350 people in 18 Zoll wide sites in the tourist class, where there are nine per line.
Airport gigants often share the heavy on technical details through publication in the fashion press.
Now it calls Airbus before Dubai Airshow, where 777X with more than 100 orders is supposed to make the road, directly to the public.
Currently, the company presented an indication that could be the beginning of a new war, and the soldiers showed a picture in which three persons were sitting in a restaurant, and the title: "Do you accept it?"
“Boeing raises long-term flows in Sitzens that are low as regional Turbo-á," says Airbus distribution team John Leahy.
In view of changed food conditions, people will be dicker, but airports have not changed radically.
between the early 1970s, as the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term travel, and the end of the century has taken the weight of the middle American men between 40 and 49 years, so the data of the United States Health Ministry.
The dimension number of the Middle American Americans in the 21th century is 100,8 cm American health statistics.
Airbus says that his rivals had a seat concept from the 1950s as the average body beginning of the fridge baptized "Jet Set".
Airbus, researchs have been carried out that an additional steel (2,54 cm) per seat increases the 53 percent of sleep quality.
Boeing encourages the numbers of airbus to the seats, and says that it does not stand in the measure of the manufacturer, how the aircraft companies raised the balance between airports and institutions.
The company also explains that, according to the investigations, the achievement of the aircraft is more than the seat width.
“It really goes out to give aircraft companies flexibility to do what they need to follow to be successful,” explains the aircraver expert Kent Craver from Boeing.
You don't want us to detail them what they're doing.
You know her business better than everyone else.
For aircrafts, it is more electronic freedom, but for the manufacturer it will be a subject that can affect the conditions.
Besides the department, a driving on airlines with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars for listing prices in the next decades, which could affect the exportbility of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the Sitzlayout is the threatening power behind the combination for the new Jets.
Even Airbus and Boeing included 20% more efficiency per seat in their recent two-motors long-stream designs than the market leader in this segment, 365-sixty Boeing 77-300ER.
The exhibition of Boeings to the results describe partially that 777X is compared with its ten seats per line with the original design of nine sits in 777.
The highest costs per unit are still less than machines used at the moment with ten seats per row.
“Therefore Boeing is able to make it competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, leader for passive comfort at the European airbus.
On the other hand, the analysts, full rooms with ten rooms per row at existing 777 stated that many passors decided that they could be increasing airports.
“Eighteen cycles would be great for pasts, but the reality is: from an economic face point, the Airbus offer has been raised by the 777s,” says Mary Kirby, expert for cabinet institutions, Gröngener and producer of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't offer a location, but a catalog of suppliers from which the air companys can choose.
The agricultural Jet sellers also take a band measure in order to achieve the establishment of competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with higher valued output for billy flows and regional flows.
Airbus offers a A350 with ten-six, but it has not been sold according to its own expenditure.
Before soon Airbus stated how important the cabin's adaptability is and for some Jets' wide sites are offered to the bridges.
Without the support of the other manufacturer, great modern Jets, experts say that the call will possibly be sold after a new branch standard, but it could be discharged from the weight of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin substance may make the conformity with the gas in the smoking
Scientifics have developed an anti-nicotin substance that could destroy the happiness of the smoking.
A single dose of the infectious substance could protect the mouse a long life before nikotin smoking.
Before human tests, further tests are needed, which can continue for a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of exploitation strategy can help millions of rauchers who have tried to listen and have tested all available methods on the market, but they have to live that their nicotin air is stronger than these approaches,” says Cornell.
The new fuel contains a harmless virus that has been changed that he contains genetic information for the production of nikotin anticorps.
The virus is selectively infected by the carbon cells that then produce an antibodies’s permanent power.
Antibodys smoke the nikotin molecules in blood and neutralize them before they get the brain, where a smoker doesn't get nikotin high.
In trying to maintain the immense museum which nikotin was attached to its normal activity level.
The Mouse would have taken a "outtime", and the researchers explained a sign that nikotin has obtained their brain.
The experiences are described in the Fachbook Science Translational Medicine.
Ancient tablets are missing because they enthyled antibodies.
The proceedings had to be given so often that they were rich and unpractic.
However, the costs of the new fuel are likely less, since he changes carbon cells in antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future infectious substance for humans may be sure that children will be disturbed before they were trying to try a cigarette, and so forget Nikotins.
But most likely it is that the fuckers would use him to stop.
“They then know: When they start to smoke again, they receive no more pleasure for the nikotin infection, and that helps them to decline the disease,” he explains.
The British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned at the same time that it was still necessary for further research.
Tripodi encourages to be influenced by Obeid
According to the previous Ministry of Labor-Partei Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a remitment is made by the State Corruption Survey.
The former NSW Ministry encourages the regulations for maritime expansion, please changed by its political mentors Eddie Obed, which covered the detailed participations on three fundamental levels on State controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has expanded their research on the freedom, if Obed various state ministers have infected, the payment contracts in Circular Quay, where the obedience had two restaurants and a café, without explanation after their excuses in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi had known that Obeids' secret interests on the baskets after Tripodis had raised the previous stabchefin Lynne Ashpole on Sunday.
In years, the Government had made public statements for the payment contracts.
The doors were driving, and they wanted to be longer.
2009, the payment contracts for the companies in Circular Quay, which took the obedience yearly 2,5 million dollars, were extended without public explanation.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally expressed for public statements.
However, he turned out to have taken changes on requests of obedience, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had taken into account the reform of the patent regulations of the Government.
One of the ICAC phone writers showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leader officer who had been changed in the Hafen Ministry after he had worked under Obeid in the fishing authorities.
“When the subject of this phone talk is to develop commercial payment rules?", Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked the Commission's representative.
“ No, ” replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was spoken, but it wasn't definitive.
It's not definitely between me and Mr Obeid.
Israelian fighting aircrafts attached targets in Syria, such official sources
The Israeli Jagd Airports would have attacked a target in the Syrian Haven Latakia, confirmed a leader of government employees against Fox News.
The officer didn't explain what the goal was, but he said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the objective of Russian SA-125 rackets.
At least twice, Israel has already carried airports on rackets in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be submitted to “Reality Test”
The Government considers, in the framework of additional measures on a “reality test” for foreign workers with 457 visa.
If the test is introduced, it is a criteria to prevent use that 457 is used to establish unqualified workplaces or to be used for family and friends to Australia.
Today, a debate proposal for the Government was published after the previous Labor Party of Labor Party, Maxine McKew, sent the comments of the Government in view of external employees, since they could be able to be conducted by the neighbors of Australia.
“Authorn statements such as , Austrians should be established behind” and, first, Australiars, are a very unexpected recovery in time in which businesses requested a protected work market,” she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it said that white work forces should be protected – and if some in the region a echo of this historical artefact would not be surprised.
The debate proposal includes twelve measures that were considered first by the former Minister Chris Bowen.
Income Minister Brendan O'Connor, who has been able to talk about human smuggels in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes that others will still be raised.
If the ‘Reality Criterium’ is taken, a person who requests a visa may be immediately checked on whether ‘the request is true in cases where the applicant is linked or linked to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company’.
In addition, companies may be obligated to take account of the number of 457 fishermen after the past companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers, finally set up hundreds of.
Furthermore, a 35-year-old sri-lankian asylant was probably dead at a heartfark after he came in this week with a flying boat on the fifth island.
The destroyed nine-year-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia will be meaned since his father's death in the middle of a growing cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island hospital where he died.
From the Government of the United Kingdom, a study has been announced to increase the price of the HS2 field project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to ensure the start of phase 1 in 2026 high speed connections between Scotland and North England.
Transport Ministry Baroness Kramer said that the project was “to get closer to the United Kingdom”.
The Scoot Transport Ministry Keith Brown explained that he was very happy to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 is from a new high-speed board connection between London and the West Midlands.
After the conclusion of phase 2, it will be connected to Manchesters and tradings.
In June, the Government corrected the assessed costs for the construction of the high speed straight between London and Northern England of 32,7 billion billion £ to 42,6 billion billion.
The British Government in conversation with the transport of Scotland has requested HS2 Ltd to search for further travel capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time at the last three hours or less than Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national stream network, the British and its cities are closer.”
We're going forward with HS2 because it's getting great price.
Without this, we stand before a capacity crisis in our front.
However, there is also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved by HS2.
The Scotical Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "The advice is a good new for Scotland."
In the name of the Scope Government Keith Brown Carmichael requested to “incomprehensively” to use the Scotic connection to the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high speed-free connection is the potential of greater economic benefits for Scotland, but the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for quick travel connections in all the United Kingdom."
That is why we are happy to work as partners of the British Government and to investigate the options for a high-speed rate connection in Scotland, the benefits for all and the connection of Glasgow Edinburgh, which has already been planned by the Scozia Government.
I'm glad to check the report with the British Ministry in the next year and conclude the next steps together.
Rules for electronic equipment in aircraft remaining in Australia properly in force
Australian airport patterns also must continue to disable tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, although efforts in the United States to lock the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US flying companys to change their properties to read passors on their devices during critical airports e-books, see or play videos if they are in the 'flow mode'.
During the largest part of the aircraft, passors have already allowed this, but many people are amazing that they can't read their e-books at start and landing.
Australian society observe the decision to implement the United States Airports unemployment, however, no direct plans to amend their provisions.
In addition, the CASA Air Security Authority declared that the advertising would be considered, but indicated that the limits in the use of electronic devices in critical airphases in Australia continued to be applied.
“The CASA has not now been prohibited specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”.
The subject underlines the provisions for which the following aircraft companys are achieved by security every time and passors should follow the security indications given by the cabiner personnel.
Virgin has already spoken with the CASA on an extension of his Wi-Fi maintenance systems and explained that it is open for changes, but they must be initiatived by the lawyer.
“We would welcome the authorisation of electronic devices through the CASA because we are convinced that this would improve the customer lives after we offer (increasing conversation) during the airport,” said a speaker.
Qantas explained that you will continue to remain in the present rules.
“Our current directives suggest that electronic devices cannot be used at start and landing, and we have no plans to change,” said the company.
The FAA regulations apply for US Airports.
However, we are always interested in developments in rules that can benefit from passors, and we will be sure that the FAA decision and the reasons of this.
The decision has been different from the United States society after the age of the floor.
You need to demonstrate that their aircrafts can interpret functions through mobile devices, and change handbooks, education materials, handheld programs and customer education.
The FAA recognised the FAA, when a airport company confirmed the tolerance of its floor, “avoids the tolerance of its floor, easier electronic devices as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones.
In strange cases in bad view, the Crew will show the passions while the landing disable the devices.
The group also recommended to ensure that severe devices were in the launch and landing insurance under the seat or in the facilities over the sites.
Before the revier by against Sulke, communicated BVB additives with aircrafts for hot scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences.
Before the friday game of the football boardsliga against the VfB Stuttgart reacted the Ultras with a weak - first.
It was an inhabitant, almost already spending akustic, which was bound the viewer to shortly before the appeal of the contract play between the German Vize-Leader Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
To hear, the guest fans were overwhelmed with their songs.
The Southern Territorys face where the faithfulest - and latest - BVB-Fans stand, first predicted outside: no steel, no smoke.
The power of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common refugee, remained uninstituted.
And in the front of the tribuns, a large failure with the "Section Stadion Prohibition".
Only as Port Rom Weidenfeller as always found as the first BVB player, burned a short-time jubel.
When his husband colleagues followed, it had a loud mind and weapon - but it wasn’t overall.
In the center blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Republic, there was nothing.
Even that the stadion preacher Norbert Dickel had reached the positive results of the last days - Derbysieg, Vig over Arsenal, Treiner Jürgen Klopp - was not concerned for the Feierlaune.
First five minutes before the capo's appeal discovered his power - and the hands to be able to rejoice in a lower cry, as the Dickel as lowest, the vote on the roads in the stadium.
Lastly, as the Southern Rivers in the row - and finally there was as the latest place in the station.
And later, when the southern ribbons came, the loud requirement "Derbyser stands up", it was all again as always.
The smoking was probably a reaction on the history of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the comprehensive BVB additives had found light rates in the surveys and on the place - and at least the portrait Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was cut off because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had the spits of the Dortman Ultras in his office - and they believe Watzkes, this was a more incompatible date for the fans representatives.
"It's going to give massive dimensions for the whole field movement," reported the BVB Boss on the deadline on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
Watzke submitted Ultras a croreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've prohibited that," he explained.
The zero-tolerance policy in business pyrotechnology is not possible.
In addition, the Ultras’s various opportunities were shown to be punished - until the Sunday they have now the time to decide for one.
In other cases, so watchke, the BVB will set a sanction until the end of the next week.
"It's increasing," safe Watchke.

Pfandhouse booms in Singapore, since the crisis has arrived in the middle ship
In a Pfand House in the incoming center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga entered a golden armreif, a ring and a couple of oranges to pay the schools of their daughters.
“My husband and I just buyed a house, where my whole money is,” says Amirthalinga.
Although it takes $3,000 of Singapore (ca 1.730 EUR) as a administrative employer, and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not exceed, she explains.
In fact, the question is in parts of South-Asia – where the decrease of the budget – so great that ValueMax, where she has taken their taxes, this week was the third Pfandhouse, which is listed in the singapurian office.
It is not only a quick way to get money – 1300 Singapur dollars in case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also as well as an unsecured bank driving.
Typically, Pfand houses in Singapore require a efficient year of 17 per cent, which is only about 15,4 per cent that requires the United Overseas Bank, a local credit manager with a film in the same purchase centre.
However, the officer offers the provision that there is no credit integrity or income checks required here, as soon as possible, the charges are faster than the banks are possible.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are in the field, after their family feel the pressure by increased livehold costs, and a low budget and consumer consumption.
Following five years, a strong growth from the global financial crisis and bills of credits seek for a closer financial policy in the developed economic rooms with smaller and middle income income to compare the difference in the lower economy.
This week refers to the Rating Agency Standard & Poor's growing budget, mainly by increased hypothecs, as a risk factor for the credit ability of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the appreciation of the Agency, the highest budget waste in Asia in relation to Bruttoinland products.
Malaysia is 80% of the BIP at the top of the list, a increase of 60% and in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about the high consumer pollution in Thailand, which has been quite out of a technical reception.
On Thursday, the data showed further existing export weight and a post of consumer demand.
“In the end, it means that the people in the middle-left segment (the income scale) will be trying to fulfil their income whereever it is possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economy at the CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highest stages in the gold prices in the past two years have still strengthened the trend to deal with personal circumstances, because people use the opportunity to convert the family's smoke in bargeld.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the locations in the 200 pants of the city of Gold.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let's put our grandmother's gold cup and get back next month."
The largest Thailand Phandhouse manager, EasyMoney, has lived a 20% customer growth in the last months.
The growth in the field business is so strong that ValueMax, the Philiale manager in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, not only to expand in the employed Malaysia – where the company is four homes – but also outside Asia, so Ja Lee Ching, employer of ValueMax.
The company finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million of Singapore dollars, which took it this week with the officer in Singapore.
While some creditors were incredible in the cross fire, they explained Yes that the households were not only more profitable than other leaders, but also not directly increased the crimes.
“It is possible to be able to be able to be able to be achieved, and the loss of personal values are not increased by the budget market,” explains it.
The shipping business is accepted in society as a short-term, safe finance.
It is also not all people who use the grounds, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax Philials to cut gold bars and rolex ears, for them to 60 percent of the price in bar.
A client comes to us from every social shield.
“It is a good-by-free, that takes a short time for a business or a investment, or a small company that needs to overcome the shipping in Cash Flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they just need very quick money.
NSA provides data from Google and Yahoo to help - Snowden
The Secret Service Encyclopædia Britannica Edward Snowden has a principal interest to help Germany in the declaration of the NSA shops that will always be breathe.
According to the Green Budstag, Hans-Christian Ströbelle, there was a surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, where the ex-secret workers would be issued in a German administration or before a research committee.

Safety Package over 325 million Australian dollars for tariff health
The Australian Government is on the severe conditions relating to the reserve package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the permanent health in order to ensure that the Government of the Contracting State cannot lose the money.
The Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will be taken “incompetent measures” to take a crisis that has been caused by an older population of the island, a higher quote to chronic disease and system limitations.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after Government agreements with the independency of the Thailand Deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“The Government has broken a challenge package that is attached to our view after the only requirements that the Agreement has seen in contrast,” said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollars package contains 31 million dollars Sofort Help for Wahlists.
With additional 2600 operations, including ortopatic income and treatment for gravity star, the rebounds should be cut off.
Furthermore, there are money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceton, better follow-ups after stational maintenance, fabric education, services in the mental health area and the introduction of an electronic health data in local hospitals.
“Their investments correspond to the ideas of which the clinic workers have said to me that they are the best opportunity to improve the stabil health system," says Tanya Plibersek.
The Ministry declared a strict report and accounting obligation of the Statute Government.
The Agreement shall maintain the current financial level to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional money were issued.
A three-head Commission is established and shall ensure that the Member State shall provide health services as effective and effective as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollars would only be useful if they are not attached to real reforms that bring the public permanent health system to a sustainable course.
In the absence of this, he prayed the Government that she had reacted to his request for the urgent aid that he first made to the Prime Minister beginning of May.
“I am convinced that the aids of the contract will contribute to take the public health system of the Agreement State from the concerns list,” said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the Contracting State, these vaccinations will be exceeded the recent measures.
However, the health policy speaker of the opposition on contract levels, Peter Dutton, is the view that today’s announcement is only a "plaster solution".
“We are therefore in this situation because the Labor State Government has taken 430 million dollars from the health system,” he said to the ABC TV.
It cannot be that a State government takes nearly half billion dollars from the system and enters the Commonwealth 300 million and then do it as good news.
Dutton requested Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the delivery package for additional bureaucracy is paid.

Syria has destroyed its possibility to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
The Syrians have destroyed chemical weapons and gitft gasmunition, and the global chemical weapons on the Sunday, while there was a serious meeting in the north of the country at the near one of the locations to be stored in the potentially useful substances.
Even on the Sunday, a Syrian activity group reported that more than 120,000 people since the beginning of the citizens war had been killed at least three years ago.
The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) was one day before the date.
1 November, which has set up in the Haag's assessment organization of Damascus to destroy all equipment for the production of chemical weapons or to make “inoperable”, including all machines for the mixture of chemicals in the gas and the fulfilment of municipality.
The conclusion of this process, which is based on the first level of destruction, is an important meal stone of a ambitioned plan, which is destined to destroy all the chemical weapons of Syria until the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can't produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy existing weapons and provisions.
Following adoptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on the Sunday War in Safira, the experts say that there was a production arrangement for chemical weapons and campaigns, such as the Syrical Observation Institute for Human Rights in the United Kingdom.
The activity group, which follows the number of dead on a network of activists in Syria, declared that on Sunday 120.296 people were dead.
There are 61.067 civilists, including 6.365 children.
On the pages of the Government, the army of President Bashar Assad was 29.954, 18.678 Government's friendship fighters and 187 Libanese Hisbollah Milies.
Furthermore, between the dead are 2.202 soldiers and 5.375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreign countries.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated before.
The conflict has forbidden about two million people to fly out of the country.
Asads troops fight a week ago in Safira against the rebels from which many connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observation office said that it had been lost on two sides on Sunday, but no details.
The battle subtracts the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are carried out because their mission to deliver Syria from his giving weapons officer is a ransom against the time in the middle of a citizen war.
According to the OPCW, cooperating with the United Nations, the team “the team is sure that it has seen all important products and mixing/building equipment and has survived their consumption."
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are planned at present.”
In the beginning of the week, the inspectors explained that they had finished the first round of the checks and visited 21 of 23 of the locations given by Damascus.
The inspectors said that the visit of two institutions were not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were two locations, explained by the syriical exhibition “and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme are distributed to other specific institutions that were inspected”.
It was not immediately clear that the location in Safira was one of the two institutions that couldn't visit OPCW inspectors.
Syria has provided a plan for the complete destruction of his chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC.
“I'm going to go to the challenge before the tackle and the strength you all have shown at the fulfillment of the most required mission that has been carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the General Director of the Monitoring Organization, published in one of the OPCW.
Since for three years, the majority of the sunnitic Muslim rebelles in this citizen war against Assad's Government and their security forces, which are associated with many members of the Alavian, is a disarmament of the islamic islam.
In view of further developments, Rami Abdurrahman, the Leader of the Observation Group said that it had given a strong explosion in a air protection facility in the Syrian southern Province Latakia.
The reason of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Wrath on the Court of Bomb Leaders of Bali
The overliving and companion of 202 people who have arrived in the Bomben proposal in Bali in 2002, reacted to the judgment for the last of the accusers who were sent before the Court, since Omar Pattech should be based on their opinion.
Pattec, who was almost ten years as one of the most assaulted South-South people on the flight, was judged yesterday for his role in the building of spring bodys for the bomb's proposal to a steal of 20 years.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old massage was found for sin because of the attack on two night clubs in the favorite tourist quarter of Kuta, who died in 202 people, including 88 Australia, and many more were lost.
In a number of terroristism approaches, a weight of pharmaceuticals at the churches in Indonesia in Health in 2000.
The State Office had requested a long-term challenge, even if it had been requested for the man, which was mentioned as the most bombbauer as the "Demolition Man" that could have requested death trap.
The decision has made painful reminders in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who has lost its 39-year-year-old daughter Jane and Jenny in the disaster of Pattec and his convicts for nearly ten years ago.
With a tree fighter she said that Patek should be judged to death.
I really mean, he should follow the feet of the other guy.
“Man should put him before a fire command,” said Corteen against AAP.
I have to live every day that I will never get any more single and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was similar to the ground when on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hours a great bomb exploded in a small laster who was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds ago a self-moderator had exploded one of the fulfilled rucksack.
He fell after the proposal for a month in the coma and the "dead" three times while he goes to a lifehold system.
Hughes said that Patek has rewarded the same shield as the three other members of the Terrore Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – which were responsible for the bloodbad and were established four years ago.
Really, this guy should be obtained by death in the presence of all others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to leave him in life.
20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds of people, it is not much.
Pattek is the last of the Bali-Bomber, who stands before the court.
He was at least a decade of the festival, but finally in January 2011, in Pakistan's city Abbottabad, where the US street forces were cut down four months later killed the previous al-Qaida-head Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiation, a FBI agency stated that secret services reports had received the indication that Pattec was found in Pakistan to meet Laden to rebuild the connection between South-Terror groups and al-Qaida.
“He didn't stand," said Corteen.
He has not shown how much pain he has added to others.
The Court has arrived before the ten-year-year day of the proposal in this year, which will be fulfilled with Getch Feeds in Bali and Australia.
“It will give a lot of dreams this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still call against his judgment.
FAA: Airports can now use electronic devices in airports (but no phone talks)
Aircrafts can now be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, games, music and use the view of movies, but not with the phone, as well as the new directives issued on Sunday of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, the passors should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, from the same aeroplane company, the FAA worker Michael Huerta explained on a press conference.
The aeroplane company must indicate the FAA that the aircraft agrees with the new directives and that they have updated the training managers of the aircraft, as well as the provisions for the discharge of the devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans of a few aircrafts that would like to build the use of tragic electronic devices in aircraft.
Under these flights, Delta and JetBlue were also.
“In the state of the plan, we could accept the extensive use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA stated in a disagreement.
Now passive smartphones, tablets and other devices need to disable when the aircraft is closed.
They can first start again when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain has a green light.
When the aircraft is entered into the aircraft, the aircrafts have to be able to restart before the aircraft is landed.
After the new directives, air companys whose aircrafts are safe against electronic deficits may allow their passions to use the devices in the start, landing and on the role field, the FAA explained.
Most of the new transport aircrafts and other aircrafts that have been reversed for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights should be complied with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Airport, welcomed the amendments.
“When the new regulation is ensuring, and we work together with the air community, both sides of it will benefit,” comments.
We are really sorry to feel like a supervisor in this subject.
However, Internet connections to survey, e-mails, text messages or downloads from data under three kilometers, the authority explained.
Passages are requested to move smartphones, tablets and other devices in the air mode.
So yet no "words with friends", the Scrabble online game that played the spectacular Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a Jet of American Airlines, because he refused to disable the device while the airport was parked on the airport.
And severe equipment such as laptops must also be discovered because there is a loss risk if they fly through the cabin.
Telephone talks in the airport remains also prohibited.
The regulatory capacity for telephone conversation is not the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may be prohibited for certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the National Transport Security Board, security experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered as risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential troubles in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also smooth the sendermasts," Rosenker.
An Advisory Committee of the Branch, which was called by the FAA to investigate this subject in life, recommended last month that the Government allows a larger use of personal electronic devices.
In the last years, the pressure has increased the FAA to lock restrictions for use.
Criticals like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represented the view that there is no valid security basis for the contract.
The restrictions are also more difficult to continue because the use of the devices has been generally careful.
In some studies, the talk that forgets or ignores to one third of the passors to disable the device.
The FAA started 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices through aircraft, after reports on the surveys of navigation and communication devices made by the UKW-Radios associated with passors, which were then presented the latest technology.
New aircrafts are often dependent on electronic systems as former generations of air carriers, but they are also built and approved by the FAA that they do not get any electronic interferences.
Fluglinies offer passages since a few years of Wi-Fi, when the airport is achieved.
Flights applied to Wi-Fi systems are also inevitable against interferences.
The overall majority of the passagiers aircraft should be applied to the increased use of electronic devices according to the new directives, Huerta said.
The current electronic devices are in general less functionality from the previous generations.
E-reader, for example, gives only the minimum radiation if you are turned away.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
For the property of a location of the restrictions for the use of devices through passions, Amazon.com.
2011 companies played a passive airport full Childle E-Reader and made a test fly to resolve problems, but they couldn't determine.
Members of the FAA committee's committee's committee's committee's missed feelings, which are the risk of the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the Passagierverband National Association of Airline Passengers said that he was the view that the crash through the devices was real, even if the risk is minimum.
Other committee members said that it was only a single report of pilots who were talking for a distortion of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee, however, recommended the FAA to allow pilots to attach the disabilities of the devices through the passors in the country of instruments.
A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and mentioned it as a sustainable adjustment for travellers who would have been currently equipped with technology.
“We are glad that the FAA recognizes that an appropriate passive life is not in the contrast of security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
For airport service of the North See Bohrin Island, eggs rescued
A per airport service on the coast flying birds that were found on a North Sea River Island, was restored to the nature.
In the last month, the water role was fled with a hub shooter to Aberdeen, where she was packed from the Scoot animal protection organization SPCA in their saving centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, leader of the center, said: “This water rail was probably a wind sugar from North Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the north sea.”
Seems that the created birds were looking for a fly on the bourin Island.
He added: "He couldn't go forward, because we were contacted with the request for help."
In their freedom, the water role was replaced and healed.
Has Europe's Elite ready to work with the British business?
Business for British was started in April to bring the economy to a table and definite what those who want to change our relations to the EU in the United Kingdom for good and work.
For this purpose, we have given the largest and efficient issues under the British Economic Leaders and asked them what they think about the British, the Economic and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1,000 leadership forces from the economy, which included British enterprises, sectors and regions.
The results of the question will be surprised.
We have discovered that the overall majority of the enterprises exported outside Europe and focused on countries, modernizing and growing, while the states in the EU stage.
They want to improve new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of keeping a long and intense process to reform corrupt EU institutions.
As asked for certain legally regulated subjects – from the Cartell Right to the product management – is the majority of the Economic Leaders of the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
It has increased general unfortunateness on the internal market, since, according to the exhibition of the companies, the costs of the Brussels would overcome the costs of the Brussels, between the provisions to be part of the European trade zone – even 40 per cent of the largest companies were the traditional in Europe's worldwide.
Finally, and that is most likely to say, our question of economic leaders has made that a clear majority of the United Kingdom wants a course in the amendment of the Agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on the policy.
This recognition, which is found in the companies of all sizes and leading concerts, shows that the economy is a “plexable change”, which brings the weight of trade back to the United Kingdom.
It is much – a change of the Agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would take at 16% a change of opinion of the remaining in the EU in a population agreement.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British Economic is behind its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership.
It also shows that the companies from a new negotiation expect a clear movement of power relations to the United Kingdom.
A better part of the British Economic is possible and, in addition, it is necessary, after the Eurozone is now moved in a new economic and fiscalion.
The priority needs to be workplaces and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our reviews shows, which means an increased attention to the trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' application for rules.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas
The beginning of the South-Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria sets the beginning of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the gasprom condition.

Listen to the Commission: Two YMCA employees before accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual declines
Two YMCA officers from New South Wales (NSW) have been attached to sexual dealings in relation to children, before 2011, prevention against the child manager Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Kingdom Commission for sexual misuse of children.
However, when the Commission was opened, the ECCA had stated that it had never been “in the organization with a case of sexual child consumption”.
The officer Phillip Hare was asked about a case when a YMCA employer had been approved with childrenpornography, and another, with which a sport manager of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was judged in 1991 because of the misuse of confidential children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistance lawyers that he knew from the first case, but he didn't know the second.
He concluded that the open declaration of the YMCA against the Commission was also unreasoned, “the YMCA has given external checks in which the YMCA was recognised as the front of the child security.”
Most evidence before the Commission show that the ECCA has been informed that he has received the second-minder assessment of four possibles in a quality saudite of the Department of Education and Communities (Earling Ministry) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, exploited that the business leadership had “forward me” in the establishment of the Lord and did not ensure that the cooperators had been on their obligations in clans to notify the disabilities against the directives on children's security.
The Lord was judged in the beginning of the year because of sexual procedures to twelve boys during his two-year activities for the YMCA.
He was judged at least six years of prison.
However, the YMCA had a cultural problem that the employer had stopped to report the Lord's Research in relation to the security of children.
The employees said that they had observed disasters, especially that Lord was alone with children, she was private as a baby sister, she left her sitting on his bed, to one said he loved it, and the children played with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the President Lord, and who had requested a school for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service leader Jacqui Barnat, who was the presidency Lord in YMCA Caringbah, “he was very surprised and most of the time was very increasing.”
The officer explained that he would not accept the statements of cooperators, where they would not have believed to submit their proposed message.
Instead, he said, I had more intended their friendship with the Lord of their judgment, because they had not told him.
Hare explained that he had informed the state of YMCA NSW that the lecture that had taken the organization from the “Jonathan-Lord-Cuck” is "not the message" by the cooperator, and the status has agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision that the employees to sign secretary obligations were taken shortly after the accusation of the accusations had been made by the officer of the YMCA officer, Liam Whitley.
He said that it should be prohibited a continent of evidence, but it was “override” and bad.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011, there was no security organization for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, experts for sexual child consumption, the Commission.
He explained that it had given the “persistent problems” in the establishment, check, training, training, education and monitoring of the workers.
The audience was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as a British Prime Minister – but dreams that a comback is impossible.
In an interview tonight, at the fifth day of his difference from the office, the 59-year-old 59-year-olds reported his views to various internal themes.
Since his return in June 2007, Blair has decreased to exceeding British policy, and most of his comments are limited to the external policy and its role as an elder of the Quartet of the Peace Student in the nearest east.
At the question, if he would like to return to the Office of the Prime Minister, Blair from Evening Standard from London was quoted with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is impossible that it happens, so ..."
When the horseview experts were found in chairs in Cardiff to buy the horse of the year, they knew that a hard competition fight was intended.
However, no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The nirpes that were not once in the kids garden, and only a few months ago he made his first step, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee found lockers through the three rounds and took the first price — where 30 adults left behind.
The unresolved couple, both the same biggest, were made to be promised by their training, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is established by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he arrived in the competition against men and women with elegant melons, he put his tea in a fresh angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was glorified by the jurists for his natural skills in the course of Pony, which led longer over his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his training and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and from every day with the Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great span."
They had to go to the entire party field and went from the place with gold pool and rosette.
It was only the second time he shared with toffee in a concurrence, and we were all struck when he won.
Full strangers in the Arena held him for so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his teenager Sharon Howells, who has been carried out over 10 years of horse.
Howells said: "The whole public was as electricized, and all have made it and cut it up."
He walked on the sand all the length of the Arena and, although he looked so worthy, he worked fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy after animals – he loves horses, tractors and builders and has two horses to care.
As he started, it will not be long until he's on the "the Year's horse" shooting – and I'm sure he'll be cut off well.
A speaker of an annual horseview said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should go to his pony."
They're a great team together.
The jurists evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how good they had been struggled and presented in the presence.
They looked at a good cooperation between Pony and Leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in Ring.
I'm sure Fentons' sweet clothes have made her part in which it's really perfect for the launch.
The Chinese journal shall be “reformed” after the call
A Chinese journal requested the freedom of a reporter who was applied to the difference should be reformed, a presser egular should be explained.
The New Express in Guangzhou had printed a strange public call for freedom of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later in the television said that he accepted the payments to fall reports about a part-state company.
Now, the new expression will be submitted to a “comprehensive rectification”, the regulatory authority explained.
The "Retification Agreement" was made by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Films and TV in Guangdong.
Preliminary reports have received that the New Express, which is located in Yangcheng Evening News Group, was published between September 2012 and August 2013 for several incompatible reports about the bodies notified company Zoomlion.
“The editing management of the new expression was unordered,” the regulatory authority stated in a statement.
She said that you decided to “a administrative crime for Chen Yongzhou and to leave his reporter licence to him.”
Furthermore, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has suggested to introduce a complete receipt of the new expression and recommended to determine the relevant responsibilities of the new expression and incompatible to check the leadership of the new expression."
Chen wrote several articles for the new expression, in which he reported about financial irregularity in a manufacturer of building machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the magazine published two calls for his freedom on the title page and turned back his journalist work.
Nevertheless, Chen was opened in the State View and gave him that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have done zoomlion as well as the whole newsbranch and its ability to win the confidence of the public,” he explained to the State Mailer CCTV.
I did it in the first line, because I was out of money and honour.
I've been clear that I've been wrong.
The new expression published an excuse on the title page and declared that it was dismissed to check the reports correctly.
Various known perspectives have recently been held in television circumstances.
Experts say that the circumstances are still rutinous, although a law change in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited to condemn someone to accuse themselves.
Drug Tunnel detected between the United States and Mexico
One of the raffined tunnels for the drug smoke between the United States and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, exploitation and electronic equipment, has been discovered.
The US authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimeters of the tunnel as one of the most exposed passages that they had ever found.
The tunnel, which moves in the cyck-zack pattern over a length of six football fields, connects the storehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, United States.
In the area there are many invisible storage halls, which makes easier to hide with loaded LKWs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were unknown transported in it, the authorities explained.
In the detection of the tunnel, eight-minute tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine are ensuring that the records of the Court are recorded.
Three men who worked as travellers according to the exhibition of the authorities were attached to Marihuana and Kokain's owner and advisory vending.
They went to a defense of prison train between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, set smugglers on an exciting underground network of detection channels.
The tunnel is the eight big passage that was discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana age in Central Mexico in October, which the drug cards show before the requirement of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a fast 640 meters of long passage with shoes, which was traveled from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two store houses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love

But in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kern still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year floor.
Viewer Orlando Bloom has exhausted to separate his wife, topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with a US journalist Katie Couric, which should be exposed at free time, Bloom said, "the life sometimes is not exactly as we plan it or hope it."
He and himself still loved, the 36-year-old.
"We will support us and love us as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010, in 2011 her son Flynn was born.
Veganism is submitted to the Vegetarism according to Lexica, but it is different from this.
For while Vegetarians allow the difference of sanetors, eas or a strong edamer, they are not on the cart of a veganist.
Milk, hair, egg, besides the face of flesh and fish, the Vegans leaves from all the disease of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, you may ask yourself, but in close regard, the vegane food environment is drawn by a considerable incident rate.
"Brot streets are very loved," explains Ute Henkelmann, the container of the hot reform house, which provides a number of special products for Vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the load in the gas.
Since 13 years ago, the born newsleeland Vegan lives in the Lampertheim, he finds (fast) what he needs for life. "1997 I made my food and became vegetarian."
For the centuries, I followed the next step and I became Vegan.
"The convincement came not only because of food but because of the choice," says Proctor, the artist leader of the normal leader.
He recognized that there is also in other interests without animal products.
First line, Vegan is a ethics.
"I don't want to die animals for me," says Proctor, the maximum of the Veganers who are increasing to the whole consumption.
Instead of traveling from burgers, travelers or gumberns, the Vegans had quickly detected all new products that increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "the vegan really gives no contrast, no assess, but it's a range." The adoption that you will reduce the selection to food options, the Proctor brings it back to the power of history.
And exactly these conditions have made some of them to separate so much common trials.
"The search factor is a totally decisive factor that allows many quickly, as if it is,," the Proctor refers to a comparison.
And say, "The established robbers are not to set in the animal."
Sometimes it is the weapons or the type of preparation that makes the smoke.
"Man can also create the same effect in other ways," says the Veganer.
To a grill feast, for example, the Proctor brings Aubergen, Champions, and also a few Vegan eggs.
He takes care of an exhausted, exchanged food, where it also should be deceived once.
Of course, you want to have something between the dents, that's legitimate.
"It's going to worry, but it's not just to reduce animal food," so Proctor.
Health disagreements until sexual disagreements, another widely widely accepted, he has not relied.
I had a positive aspect for the conversion.
I don't take a foreign colesterin and have a higher vitaminantil.
There are high-levels that only have grown.
"My blood values are best, I'll make me sometimes check," proctor distributed.
Especially before the lack of vitamin B12 warns many Vegansimus critics.
"The animals with feeds are nutrited instead of grassing on the weight, it is questionable if the flesh that is buying in the woods, the vitamin B12 is higher", found Proctor.
For Vegans, it also provides the opportunity to take coenzim in form of tablets.
"My B12 values are all right," he explains.
By ways, the Proctor must not go to food process.
Basic foods are, finally, and every supermarket has middle sojamile and other products.
All I need, I'll find forward.
I'm just gonna buy something special.
"A lot of people sure that only the products of the preparation are weird, but that is similar to the "normal" products."
Without the preparation of vegan drifts, it is most useful and less timely than commonly accepted.
"In the cabiny there is much to discover, with a few small knifes you can be good if you don't partly get better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a few more back-ups and cool oils instead of eating, with his vegan cupcakes, Proctor could also bring his smooth parents to the stain.
Family feasts gives Vegan a new whirlwind.
That's dynamic when you buy together, it's a new position value.
"The situations that can exist are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has already been deceived by scepsis.
Doesn't you pick my food anymore?
"I can feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you must act as Veganer with fingerprint feelings.
"I'm not leaving people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to refresh the keyboard dawn.
And exactly considers the universe, then, doesn't appear so veganfremble as immuted, and the Vegan does not be limited to the whole day as common.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are all around!
"A lot of dances offer falsefels, or also a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he is worth pastorates, or offers a pizza without a cash, everything is a question of history.
The restaurants are so late.
"If I started to gain me vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult," the New Zealand could make a development: "Man needs to talk to people to watch them."
"When there are enough questions, they may be allowed to find food cards," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants are developed, for example, the bus in Mannheim or the coffee Vogel Free.
Proctor is the desire that other restaurants have at least a vegan's judgment on the food map.
For the reasons, weapons are worthy of all of them.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the same part of exclusive.
"The flesh judges are very exclusive, and in the most real meaning of the word, because they close others," sets Proctor.
"When you want to deny food channels, Veganism is a safe way to make the most largest part of the frontier," says Proctor.
But the purchase of vegan products may be something hard to start.
Especially, if you learn to understand which can also contain animal additives as colored materials in the earth, you seem to leave with the follow-up of the ethics in so many heats and cases of strength quickly.
It is not only why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal contents and their alternatives" explains the many contents that are used for food but also cleaning.
"After and after, you have developed a scanner view and know what signs and logs you're looking for, "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to smoke," knows Proctor.
Veganism, he is a major moral fingerprint that is attached to the consciousness.
Perhaps he can't be able to allow his circumstances, but at least he can teach the consumers to question critically.

The British Police provides an expenditure decision
The British Police has delivered a public report to the WikiLeaks members of Julian Assange, who searched for the equatorial message in London and requested asyl.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year Australia had a “requiring to set up” that required him to appear in a police Guard, and added to him, he should not be achieved.
While the exemption to Sweden has been rejected in a sexual decline after its possibilities were exceeded by the British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its intention against the exemption of the beginning of the month.
Since he fears, Stockholm will deliver him to the United States, he was looking forward in the Ecuador News in London and requested the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “a 40-year-old man has made a requirement to set up one of us in a police watch,” explained a speaker.
He continues to lose the conditions of his freedom on counsel.
The message has not received comments on the admission of the police requirements.
As it fears that he will be delivered by Sweden to the United States, and it will be approved for possible spioning proposals after he had published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
Travelers with 210 km/h and hot smoking between the feet, gets 1.000 £ penalty
A car carrier has been punished in high of 1,000 £ because he was driving up to 210 km/h and a heavy limit between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Titree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Brain Tree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the shooter between his legs.
Before the Office of Colchester, Howie was convinced without being the needed sorgfalt and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month vehicle prohibition.
Howie was also judged to pay costs in high of 90 £ and a victim contract of 100 £.
Implementation for foreign immobilists against London's specialization balls
The Financial Ministry has provisoryly calculated the CGT measure, however, waiting for the final decision of the Cheap Cancer George Osborne in the budget 2012, which had granted a range of 7 % to rooms that cost over two million £ and annual payments for buyers, as a company, and not as a single person.
Presently, the income from the spectrum of residence in the Western Minister and Kensington & Chelsea, which are located in 2012/13 at 708 million pounds, collected the solutions for North Irland, Wales, Scotland, Northwest, Yorkshire and the region Humber.
Cook said: “After the increases in the smooth steel at high price rooms and the introduction of the legislation related to the environment, you can hardly be considered that high-valuable immobilities are too low, unless the effects of the loaded community control system.”
“But this step could make a few outland investors to buy immobiles in London or to sell the owners of it,” added.
First classic immobilies – the top five to ten percent of the residence market after price – in the passenger London southwest port, which was exhausted from Fullam to Wimbledon, were defensive for the record value of 11,8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London show the same annual growth of 5,6%, but they were transferred by a surrounding “Inland market”, on which the southwest part of the city, the Northern (7,4%) and the East (6,5%) had a surrounding trend of Savills.
Scientifics could make more light in which the swallows of a dog with his vote.
Previous researchs have shown that happy dogs with the swallow more to the right (on the face of the dog), while it was the left side with nervous dogs.
However, now scientists say that other dogs are aware of these different differences and can reage on it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurologist of the University of Trient, said: “When people are well known that the left and right brains are different to Stimuli, the positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that when dogs, the right brain is compatible with the movement of the left side and that both hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs reage on their artgenoes, the researchers watched the animals while they saw these films other dogs.
They make the heart frequency of the four beans and analyze the behavior.
Perhaps we'll understand soon why the wedding moves in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – or a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects, and we could steal the movement of the swance more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an independent without expressing dog moved the swans to the right (see the perspective of the honey's stealing), they remained fully disappointed.
But the swanning was particularly left (or from the perspective of the dog, which was smoking), their heart frequency increased and they looked unreasoned.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs communicate unlikely by these movements.
He is more sure that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not.
He said: “If you have different conventions with other dogs and the smoking with the weight in a way of peaceful behavior, and the right side produces a smaller peaceful behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the recognition of dogs, animals and trainers could help a better understanding of the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, experts for dog treatment and gaststypendiat on the faculty for the animal health of the University of Bristol explained that it was not the first study, where it was investigated whether the left and right for dogs was important.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University found that the dog turned the head to the left when they looked at a aggressive dog, and on the right, if it works for a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following stated: “Hunde goes closer to a roboterhound, if it's the left, and not the right, instead of being disrupted – exactly different than in the Italian study.”
According to his exhibition, the differences could be able to make the difference that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in films or robots as dogs.
A study, as the dogs react to real dogs, could help him, explained.
“Swar exists significant values for many different animals that both brain helps to be used for various purposes, but many of the details must still be determined – and dogs don't make exception,” says Bradshaw.
Since their behavior is simple, it is probably not long until we understand why the weakness is sometimes moved into one, sometimes in the other direction.

Papst Francis replaced in February the first cardille
Papst Francis will first be called new cardilles of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican was known on Sunday.
Cardilleles are the highest churchs in the Catholic Church after the Papst, and they are also choosing a papist, so that the first group of men will be renamed by the first group of men, which will finally be affected by the election of his followers.
Now there are 201 cardilles.
However, a cardinal who has a 80-year-old age can not participate in the Papst Selection – that ends a group of 120 “selected cardilles”.
In a statement in which the message was known, the Father Federico Lombardi, a vatican speaker, will find a meeting of all cardilles before Zeremonia is stopped to rename the new cardelle, which is known as consistory.
“Papst Francis decided to recognize his decision to the introduction of the consistory in February in order to be planned for other meetings required by the participation of Cardelle from all the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of the electioned cardilles will probably be sad until February.
He explained that a papaz usually called so many cardilles as necessary to retain the number of choice cardilles to 120, and so many cardilles over 80, as he wants.
The consistory in the next year is therefore significant because it is the first since the choice of France in March, so Valero.
It is now a certain agreement on Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interested to see if the new Papst Cardelle will be renamed from the rest of the world to restore the equal weight,” he said.
Fourty per cent of the Catholics live in South America, but they only have a variety of cardilles.
The Cardilles will also be the first, which will be called from the education of the French Council of Cardillele, a group of eight cardilles from the world who have the task to find opportunities to reform the church.
In the past, the father decided everything alone.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardilles to help him,” said Valero.
He explained that it was “behaviourable” that Francis would ask the cardilles for the Council.
But before we were not in this situation – that's all new.
Valero said that typically, the cups of large places would be called to Cardillele, but the franzishus stated “full surprises – we don't know who it is called.”
GM calls new pickup presses in the United States to reparate the seat lead
General Motors calls at least 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup presss with 2014 to address a problem with the manually manually manually manualed seats, so a communication of the US regulatory authorities for vehicle safety on free day.
In some of the cars, it can give a defect in the mechanism for the recovery of the front seats.
For this reason, they do not fulfil the agreement guidelines for the vehicle safety support.
“When the vehicle is located behind the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not protect the insects correctly, so that there is a high risk of pollution,” was reading in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The revoked models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM presss started in June and provides the most important model start of the US car generator since the insolvency conditions of restructuring 2009.
GM informed the vehicle officer in the first October of the defect.
The NHTSA could not check the notification letters due to the 16-day Government of Shutdowns, as negatively affected the cars sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were re-evolved for the model year 2014, has increased in the first ten months of the year at 20 per cent, explained the GM on free day.
In October, GM 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup presss.
The GM Action increased 1,4 per cent to 37,47 US dollars on the Friday.
Slide of a Obama Selection
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that the change is possible.
He says that Obama has taken loyal efforts which have been required by the blockadetaktic of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not apologize the Web site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks.
Obamas Memorials on the election war 2008 are a serious reminder that it would be possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a crazy book now.
It's a book I believed it would bring me up during the second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Mut to win) and writes the Memory Barack Obamas to the President's election 2008.
When I'm ready with my patient descriptions last night and go to bed, then I'm bringing the book back to a time when the millions of the politicals inspired and a speaker could cut off the attempt.
The choice was held to a landscape and newspaper to lead the historical significance of this hour.
My class cameras wept before joy and my parents gathered all magazines that they could find.
A young team of visioners was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama changed to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 % approval values.
And then I closed the book.
It is a bad growth that is to be turned away from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimist times – they seem to be a fair reminder of a serious view of opportunities.
In the years, since I first repeated my voice, something really changed.
But it's nothing I could imagine.
I recognize the greatest and virtual things that Obama has obtained from the agreement of the affordable Care Act for the sickness to the military department of Iraq, the end of the excessive disaster of homosexuality in the army and the death of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party-politic blockadeactics have been taken to many efforts with which our nation should be carried forward: investment reform, a public option for hospital security and the shutting of Guantanamo Bay to call only some.
But after I have defended Obama Government against colleagues and knowledge, I am at the end of my statement.
I got a point of political disagreement.
The Republican Blocked Policy cannot explain, as it is allowed to allow outside State Leaders or to kill innocent children through drugs in oversee.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower will be confirmed to open the state missing.
It is not possible to explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed without procedures, even why the public financing and output limits are passed during the president's elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which the white house's efforts to restrain the media are the “agressive... from Nixon Government”.
And at least it can't apologize the impossible, for more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was decisived, a simple website.
I don't know if it's what I should expect.
If I should understand 18, the government's work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Secretary-General is not a pre-profit curs, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Messagger provides public discussions.
However, if I see the above examples, they seem to be elected by the Government itself.
And that's most of me.
I have chosen Obama again 2012 not because I was concerned about his candidate.
Middle Romney made an increasing and ungenerated alternative that he seemed not to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second office time for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices, would be fulfilled by the hope we had heard so long.
However, with the consideration of the appointment values for Obama at more than 45% this week, the return in 2008 has become so hard in this book.
I'm aware of the reward of the many promises that have made up in the air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton at the proposals in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorals after the decision, he said his partners, they should come back to the course and follow their purpose.
"I want us to find our sauber again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I couldn't accept you stronger.
The views expressed in this comment are excluded by Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parent injury
The billioner and delegated Clive Palmer says that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parents' rate, because his daughters are weak and so they could benefit from it.
The mountainbaumagnat, which is in a judicial agreement on the payment of 6 million dollars to CO2 control, has not been considered when he wanted to move questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for the decision whether the CO2 and the mountain builts are cut off or covered.
But Palmer said that only Minister of interest could have conflicts and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally by the laws.
“He is in a great conflict of interest when it goes to pay for parents, because if one of his daughters is weaker, he has a direct interest in whether she receives or not,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election committee Palmer declared 53 votes preview after the new statement officially to win the Sunshine Coast Sitz of Fairfax.
Palmer requested a review of the process to steel numbers to go quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Whether these selections should be resolved two months after the end of the sound output
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have no system in which you're marking the data into a computer, immediately choose and then have the result at 6:30 to the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of lyrics in marking the steel.
Do you use them because you can exceed the results if they don't like one?
Today adding with breasts is incredible.
The election Committee has tested the options for an electronic election and recently published a common law proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “really seriously”.
In a public office, it is about the public service.
“We have no reward except the story, that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspends two devises
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two manufacturers from their devise department, as well as two persons who are trusted with the situation; this is a further index that the world-wide official examination of the mutual mandates on the monetary market is rarely accepted.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Germany Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, to change the inhabitants for 5,3 billion dollars each day.
The two handhelds would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the extensive investigation that the Skandal around the Libor Internet Business.
The bank that has not received comments to the supply has confirmed that they have received information requests from the authorities.
The Bank said: “Our reports to this subject continue and we cooperate completely with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,”
Last month, the RBS had submitted the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous manufacturer, to the British supervisor authority, the financial Conduct Authority.
This manufacturer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and would be urged between its current position as the European Leader of Forex-Spot handles at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, leader of the European Spot Trading Trading in Citi, was urged this week and Matt Gardiner, the previous leader of monetary in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these handlers had been proposed for any mistakes.
To the Instant Message Group of Usher, bankers in Barclays and the Citi Group said the situation.
The UBS has known this week that they have taken steps against some of their cooperators after the Switzerland regulation authority had explained that they have investigated a mutual manipulation of the Devise market in a number of Switzerland banks.
At least six authorities in the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Switzerland Concurrency Authority Weko, the FCA, the United States Justice Minister and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently employed with proposals in which bankers should have discussed transactions on the money market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also have introduced internal studies or received information requests from the authorities, said to the situation.
Banks through Instant Messages and E-mails for several years in search of cases of mistakes.
The news about these investigations has moved the manufacturers in a range of exploitation that has heard one of the most professional trading units of investment banks in the last years, but this year has been pressed because lower volatility is limited to the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play the agencies and said that it was nearly impossible to manipulate the exposed and high-gravity liquid devise market, but leading hands are the view that it is not true.
A leading handler noted that, although the big day volume in the devise trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trade platforms and the appropriate use of own internal platforms by banks that “man can already affect the market with very generous ticket prices”.
The message came on the same day when Credit Suisse knew that this week she reported a handler of her London Exchange Trade Office after he had a loss of about six million dollars in the end of the last year.
The Bank reported prompts the competent authorities and works together with them.
"We are sure that the manufacturer has treated alone and that the matter has been involved," said Credit Suisse.
Makes the buildzaun on the beetle-screen
A group of citizens initiatives "Sweizer Wiese" has improved the buildzaun on the beach-leading dimension at the curpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Furthermore, she broke and extended them to the feet, it is called in a pre-section.
The planned decoration of the exploited house in the ground part was not allowed from safety grounds, because the staff was cut off.
Alfred Abel, who has currently managed the basic stage, had spoken the amazing action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a transparency with the message "We are carried out."
However, the 20 members of the citizens' initiative were a little bit in their action.
Her motto on the big place called "We are against Bauruïnes."

As an uncharismatic "exhaustion" of the brothership, his personal prices have been accepted since his wealth and a freedom, in which he was not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all of those who had been presented that the assaults of the resurrection from 2011 against the authors of Mubarak.

The company has increased its benefits for the whole year and expected records of urbans in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel companies are now from a purchased annual wine for rate between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous prognoses.
If the current target values are achieved, the increase of 12 to 17 per cent in comparison to record wine of 290,4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As the employer Graham Turner known, the Flight Centre in the first half year was eight percent winning and built a strong start in the second half year, especially in Australia and British private business.
“Our ten countries are professional since the beginning of the year, and some of them are in a good way in the direction of registration annual entities before the costs and controls,” he explained.
This is Australia and British, which are typically to our strongest results.
In Australia, the free-time branch has received in the second half of the year, which is clearly a easy hard market for business travels.

Schools are maintained to greater focus on mathematics, laws and graphics
In the courses of English literature, students need to be treated at least one piece of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, romantic Lyric and timegeneous British Romans since 1914.
In the test, there are also “invisible texts” input to read too larger.
The combined curses from English literature and language will be achieved.
Since 2015, students need to take a custom GCSE test for languages, whereas it is strong to choose English literature as separate quality.
The Ministry of education will be published tomorrow the new teachings plans for English and Mathematics – the first factors that were radically converted.
Other kernels will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, the supervisor authorities of tests, a new organization of GCSE structures, including a new use system and a few short works.
In one conversation in the room, Mr. Michael Gove said that there is a wide consensus that we need to reform our test system to restore public confidence, and he stated that the GCSEs would be “required, ambitionate and stricter”.
Studies show that in English schools less time is used for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per year – than in most other countries.
At the same time, the Australian schools are about 143 hours per year and students in Singapore received 138 hours.
However, it is not a formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour schedule, but from coalition crowds it means that the environmental mathematics test – combinated with a stronger weight of the fashion in racing lists – schools will possibly be encouraged to fix more hours.
In the teaching plan, there is more attention to the “Problemes from the right life”, including financial mathematics.

Travel by slamm, flows and shoes for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medicine help in remote villages in Camerun
Bwelle and his team lead nearly every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5000 people
Call down here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other helds in the top 10 to select him to the CNN Hero of the Year.
The guest receives $25,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
21 years ago, George's Bwelle saw how his crazy father had always lost the conscience and went to hospitals who didn't have over the middle to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was threatened in 1981 at a car accident near Yaoundé, the main city of Cameruns.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then he made a disaster that expanded himself on his brain and caused a hematome that should take him into account for the rest of his life.
“ There was no neurochirurgen in Camerun,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of the camera if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell's years were broken to join his father in superplexed clinicals and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 tomorrow and go to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Bwelles father was dead since 2002.
In Camerun there is only a doctor for five thousand people, so the World Health Organization.
In addition, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 persons.
However, even if it gives them a doctor, most of the cameras could not be visited.
Two of five people in the country live below the poverty limits and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is the poverty," says Bwelle.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his country leaders suffered to see in Bwelle the decision to undertake something.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his freedom officer have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He himself was a doctor and worked as a feed officer in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
Moreover, he founded a common organization named ASCOVIME, which lives for weeks in rural areas and offers a free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his liberal group helped about 32,000 people.
Nearly every freetage, he and to 30 people traveled in small buses and walked with the worried medical disarmament on the board on the ground in the villages that need help.
It doesn't always beyond all of it.
Even more than one time they had to shoot the vehicles through flowers and slamm.
But when they are coming, they will receive as helds: a festival, an advice and a dance and the best subtraction that has to offer the place.
In these victories there is really a reason for feeding and bulls — with its wide wheels and its unlimited energy – is pleased in the happy feeding.
The team begins next morning with the study of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people for traveling,” says Bwelle.
They come from a circuit of 60 kilometers around the town – and it goes to foot.
Each of these weekend clinicals provides medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculus, undertaking, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others have cuts, cups, or uncovered origins – a document that is required for school, but many poor families can't be able to help.
Tonight, the team makes easy operations with local exploitation.
The operations are usually located in a school, rathaus or a room; after the attack, the patients are up and go into the reaching area to make place for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the deinfection equipment will be eaten by the generator of the group and so worked by the balls and its freedoms until the early morning hours on the Sunday.
It's a threatening pension, but the village musicians usually help to maintain the team motivated.
“You are threatened all night to stay and keep our job,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, then the team goes back to the city, slowly, but honourable on the work made.
The group – a mixing of camera doctors and external medicine students – has carried out 700 non-country operations last year and knows that it affects a great difference for people who help them with their work.
One man explained that the uncovered operation of a breath that he had received to work now.
“ This changes the future of my family, ” said the man.
Besides the weekend clinicals and his work as chirurg in the hospital, Bwelle works evening in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his common activities, so Bwelle; the rest is from private speeds.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studies the Dr. Trexel University in Philadelphia medicine and works freely in Bwelles Group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to get money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that would never get home.
“We can be in operations where we help to get blood up or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle,” explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as medical students in the second year.
The students normally pay their journey to Camerun and bring sometimes locked health materials.
But if she's only one time in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes the subtraction, transport and guidance.
"He's absolutely a held," said O'Malley.
He encourages his life of this organization and his desire to help the camera people, not knowing limits.
For Bwelle, the nearly permanent work is not loading.
Others to help a happy life and to fulfill a promise that he has given his Father is prepared for him a great joy.
"I am so happy if I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and lift the pains.

Exclude the battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle, "The old man and the sea," is cut off Horst Janson on the body.
Janson himself is an old chase in his meter, the shooting artist.
The old man Santiago can't make anything at the beginning of fish.
That's how they're just great.
You're almost meaning that the falses in the skin of the old man, of which the fishery young Manolo says, can see.
If Santiago seats on the throne, it's really at Janson.
Then the role of the old fishermen is through and through a character role that is excellently mastering Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a mud man who doesn't reward and finally through his knowledge and his will also win the fight against the fish.
Janson's in the middle streets as a single manufacturer on the bowl.
He makes focus on the attention of the public, so that his monologes are not long-term.
His efforts to go to the fish finally to the surface of the water are so much that the supervisors forget that the sea is only of blue water flashes.
Regisher Jens Hasselmann allows the old man in the boat before the fishery.
In the front of the introduction, he set the active scene in the light: the tent of Santiago, the bar of the song Mary-Luise Gunst, who lives with her songs and her glorious voice, the feeling of life is Cubas.
The four musicians play Cubas Rhythmus and are like guests of the bar.
Tourism: Agreement to the Romans
At about 120 meters length is obtained inside the collars a water channel from the Roman time.
Whoever visits the bullets, he's not finished in the Dom.
Round 157 meters the two doors in the sky and make it to the second top of the church building of Europe.
However, only a few visitors who are the two philosophic cerebrals, unless there are also a lot of discovery under the dome.
Rainer school is expert in the cases of Kölner's suburb.
The service center of Köln-Tourismus is directly on the Dom.
The round starts very unspectacularly, "We started in the deep garage," says the school.
In the seventy years the fathers of the city wanted a carried city, and thus remained from the rest of the old city wall only standing that was not too large.
The most users of the parkhouse are therefore fulfilled today also to the Roman oversight and only remove their car.
However, whoever looks exactly at the Parkdeck D2 detectes an archeological foundation separated by the metalgit steel.
To see are about five meters of high rounds from handheld large stones.
"There are the rest of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says the school.
Before it comes back to the daylight, the school allows the participants to the top parking area still a look in a window, 15 meters deep steel.
This is the branch of the old domes, which is less to be cut off.
The next station of the border is the pretorium, and here the participants go down to the depth.
We live here to the office of the only powerful man in the north of the Alpen, the President of the CCAA.
What the CCAA means, you want to know a visitor.
"The absurdation is for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good Germany so much as "Stadt of Roman law and city of the Agrippaner, based under Kaiser Claudius in the place of the altar for the Caiser cult."
And in the pretorium, it is about the old staff palast, the power center of the Roman Imperium in Rhin.
From the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman water channel, which has been obtained around 120 meters.
"You can take a piece quiet from the same named Cloaca Maxima if you want," the school mounts the guests.
A surprise is still a school.
After he got the key in the box, he leads the group to 16 meters deep, low steel.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish Bad," he explains.
The Jewish community built her bath in the ground to come to the basic water that was unbelievable for the ritual shoes.
Since today, the end of the Mikwee, which origins return to the eighth century, can be changed by the changed branch.
The Mikwe is part of an archeological zone on the ratio place to start building works in curse.
But there will be a few years until it is completed.
Beef fast covered: Rebuilding of Rocker process
A blood attack in the rocker mileu will be rebuilt over four years.
A process has started due to trial crimes, dangerous body consumption and sackage against two-30-year-old-year-old country court Frankfurt (or).
It will be joined by strict security procedures.
The accommodations switch to the arrest.
They should be active in the rocker scene and then have heard the bandidos.
In June 2009, the State Agency suggests to enter and enter three men in a car together with unknown compliments in Finovfurt in June 2009.
All victims were hardly hurt, a man would almost lose his feet.
The victims should be listed to the competitive grouping of Hell Angels.
One must be a high-term member of Berlin.
Progress appeared to be a persecution year with several cars.
According to the attack, there was a review fight and a power demonstration.
The two accommodations were in the beginning of 2012 in a first procedure.
A court speaker said that it was not able to prove that men were actually involved in the blood feed.
The deads took masks and were not recognized.
The Court of Agricultural Court adopted the judgment after the Revision of the State Agency and submitted it to the renewed negotiation to the Agricultural Court.
One of the accommodations is currently due to another delict in open ship.
It was especially about the rebuilding of traveling in the night.
As a witness, the commissary once was loaded.
In the center, the telephone talks of the officers and other persons who had listed to the police.
It is difficult that Rocker is almost always holding a loyal law for them - and not to say.
It also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims was packed.
State lawyer Stefan Golfier from the State Office Frankfurt (Oder) said to the question that it was attracted from the last procedure.
For the process, eleven more treatment days are set.
The relief company does not think
The night was long, the music sounds, and the vote is good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the books of people on the traveling and backs, the hungry is noted.
Of course, that can be responsible for one or another cocktail or section!
What is closer to go to the next Drive In to enjoy a smallness?
I'm going to give me, I'm happy with that when it's relationship with the fastfood hole at the evening morning.
A couple of pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nix as far from home and in bed!
However, on the home way, the clear difference between me and other hungry disco cancers are not observed.
Because what must a missing that you're going out of the car window with constantly regularly?
Especially on weekends, rolled patterns in the streets and at parking places are removed.
"What?" I ask.
Is the people to do so to take the teeth with respective home to the next movement?
It's not just so that the paper product has transformed the landscape.
They also have already hidden transport institutions such as guidance plans, and that is the case of accidents.
In this regard, the "World Company" does not follow, it probably doesn't know what this word really mean.
If you're over the night, just right with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after night: clomots, flashes and other muscles are driving there.
There would be a few tits more or less - in accordance with the street, where no one wants to smoke on the rest of the food.
I see the day comes when the cities and the congregations will be disappointed, and the fast-food-cats need to ask for their shoes.
Obamas Research in Health Policy

After centuries of thousands of their guests received a reporting letter, the republicans gave the President in the last days, he broke the American public.
Yesterday Obama related to its original promise.
“The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functioning insurance can keep them,” he said in a conversation in Boston.
As a response to the multiple media reports to the reports, Obama requested the Americans who received such communications to look at the free market after a new security.
Most citizens could have a better, low-sufficiency security for the same price or more beneficial than prognosed.
"You're coming a better offer," he said.
The Government mentioned it as a little surprised that the five percent of the population who have concluded a security should be considered after another tariff, since its Treaty does not consider the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say these Americans, 'You have rewarded better,' said Zebelius, in an audience before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Acts, explained that the start of the online platform has been moved since October.
“I am also frustrated and weak as all others,” she said.
I decided to reach your trust.
This explanation of a Sebelius to a seat counseler behind her at the strict hearing in the representative house was taken after a war talk with the Republican Republic of London from Missouri, and it was therefore committed to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated with the question, why the "Architektin" of the Affordable Care Acts has not been freely committed to a publicly promoted insurance to conclude a tarif at HealthCare.gov, which now wants to sell millions of Americans.

Australian calls against prison trap in Thailand
A 21-year woman from Sydney, who was judged in Phuket to 15 days of prison, because she was infectiously considered to be authorized by a taxi carrier, has set up against the court of call and was released on the counsel.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first discovered by a Province Court in Phuket on 15 June for accusation to have made a false office after she had given the Taiwan police, a local taxi vehicle was charged in the morning hours of the morning, on 10 June, while two other men were held.
However, afterwards, the videocams showed that she was safe in her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket listen to Bamford two days until she had been thinking about the story.
Before the Court negotiation, she was in police warranty.
Bamford was judged at a 15-day prison trap in a prison station with low security level at the border Phukets, instead of a prison for adult women.
She's the daughter of Peter Tunks, an older player of the Australian Ruby Liga, who returned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for her daughter.
Tunks explained about the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her to be back in Australia.
"We are sure we are very worried, but we hope she is as soon as possible to home," said Tunks.
Bamford has set up against the court of call and is against a cooking of 50,000 baths on free feet.

From the Court was to hear Bamford, by a local lawyer in Phuket, and was warned that the call could also be taken into prison for adults from to two years.
However, it is possible that Thailand could be trying to improve his increasing tourist image after the recent killing of Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore it comes to a free prompt.
