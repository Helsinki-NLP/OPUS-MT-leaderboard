Thou shalt swallow like water, thou shalt not high, because thou hast gone up the cup of thy father's house, and hast swallowed my street.
If I also speak of men, and the angels of the languages, and not the love that I am prophesied, I am a resoning ice, or a cymbalo.
Thou hast swallowed my heart in one of thy eyes, and in one cup of thy hair.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of the inheritance of thy house, which thou hast done, O LORD, the sanctuary, which have established the hands of the smoke.
Keep this lawful word to you and your children until ever.
Thou shalt live with thy sword, and thou shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt swallow his joke out of thy brass.
Don't worship them, nor serve them: for I am Yahweh your God, the God of Zelotes, who visit the iniquity of the fathers in the children of the third generation, and the fourth generation of them that hate me, and do mercy on thousands of those who love me, and keep my deeds.
You don't speak false witness against your neighbor.
Don't worry about your neighbor's house: you don't want his wife, no slave, no slave, no bull, no ass, nor all that she is.
You don't go up by grade to my altar, don't show your sorrow.
You shall not make thee an image, nor any likeness of them, which are in the circle above, and which is in the ground bottom, and which is in the waters under the earth.
You don't hurt.
Don't make the name of the LORD thy God falsehood: for the LORD shall not have an unbelievable thing to the name of the LORD his God.
You have extended your hand, the earth has destroyed them.
