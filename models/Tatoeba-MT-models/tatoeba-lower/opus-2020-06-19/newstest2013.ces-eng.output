Revolution of the Republic Parties Strategy against Obamo
The Republican leaders caused their policy to fight the needs of the elections.
However, the Brennan Centre indicates that the choice is less frequent in the United States than the number of persons who die after the bottom.
Republican advocates, last 10 years, noticed only 300 cases of choice in the United States.
One is sure: these new provisions will have negative impact on the election participation.
In this meaning, these measures are partly subtracted by the American Democratic System.
The United States are responsible for the federal election organization of individual States in the United States.
And in this spirit, most of the American governments since 2009 speak new laws that cause the choice or write to the election list.
This is noted in November 2010, when 675 new republished Republic Defence in 26 States.
In the following case, 180 proposals were provided for in 2011 by the legislation of limiting election law in 41 States.
New choice laws require the electorers to provide a proof of identity with photographs and evidence of American citizenship.
These laws are also limited to time for elections in the presence, disabilities the right to write to the list of choices on the day of the election and take the election right to the citizens in writing in the Criminal Register.
Before the elections in 2006, no American state was required to provide the currency of a proof of identity with photography.
The first State that took this requirement was Indiana.
The statute of the Indian law confirmed the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republic Offices have quickly extended this procedure as well as in other States.
For the past two years, the proposals of such laws in 34 States were supported to apply the carriers to introduce identity of photographs.
It is necessary to note that, in the differences of Quebec, the Americans have no universal identity tests, such as the health security map.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens, including 21 million persons in the age of age, no evidence of identity with the photographed by the Government Authority of their State.
There is still no evidence of this identity about five million new volunteers in 2012.
The required certificate of identity is also often more than one hundred dollars.
New restrictions are inappropriately affected by young, minor companies and persons with lower accommodations.
25% of the Africans, 15% of people with $35,000; 18% of the citizens of older 65 years and 20% of the collectors in age 18 to 29 years is therefore not required by an identity test with photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who are as a choiceer of their advice to the democratic candidates are not authorised to use their identity tests with the photograph of their school.
On the other hand, those States allow the members of fishing or fisheries clubs that are often volunteers of the Republic candidates to use these clubs in choices.
There was no State requested for the election of a proof of residence until 2004.
Arizona's first request.
From 2011, almost twelve States were adopted, which determine the obligation of the electorers to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly directed to limit the number of votes from Spain minors.
It is not easy to note that two of the three Spains give the presence of the democratic side.
The Republic legislators in 2011 supported the laws in eight States that moved the record of the elections in the day of the conclusion of the election.
They restricted the right of persons and groups to provide aid to the volunteers who want to write.
These restrictions have their results.
For example, during the general elections in 2004, the campaign helped the campaign to record shipping 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted after 2009, however, in 2010, were 17% of the rate of 2006.
Republic lawers then adopted the laws for the delay of time for elections in the presence.
For example, during the universe elections in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the African electoral elections chosen in the presence, although the African choices in this country were only 13%.
It was the same with the Spanish people.
They created only 11% of all choices, but 24% of the citizens who voted in the presence.
On the other hand, the 76% of all choices have created only 46% of the choices who have chosen in the presence.
The contrary to approval of the laws that limit the records of the electoral, of course, have established democratic lawyers and their supporters.
Democratic gubernators locked a number of law proposals.
In order to stop the fulfillment of the most controlled laws, the General Procurator of the United States has even been established.
The worries have been restricted to them.
For example, the laws required to provide an authentication to photograph only 16 of 34 States.
However, the new implemented rules are totally unpiratable in 2012.
Democratic crisis focuses on the presumption of the laws approved and considers it clearly to influence the results of the choices in 2012 in key States.
The report of Brennanova from 2011 shows that the states where these laws were approved, represent 171 of 270 votes in the congregation of electoral elections required for victory in the President's options.
It is too soon to declare that these legislative changes on the level of the election system will have a significant impact on the results of the President's elections in 2012.
One is sure today: these new provisions will have an inevitable impact on the election participation.
In this meaning, these measures are partly subtracted by the American Democratic System.
Resolution of the skins of prostacity: absolver the research or not?
The PSA test has brought lectures of false results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to the rest of medical procedures.
All of this has increased the weakness of men who have already been able to investigate.
Do you want to investigate or not?
We asked two officers.
In the U.S. studies, a high level of concentration between individual tested groups has been demonstrated, it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and bring a valueful recommendation.
Another study, this time European, has constituted a different death between patients who have submitted research and those who have not come on them.
This study also showed after 12 years of degree that those who are not to investigate have 30 to 40% higher risk of the metastasis exhibition.
I therefore admit an investigation from 50 or 40 years of age, if your right neighbor had a prostitute.
The worst groups are also men of African origin.
The key is to take a correct decision when the racoon is deleted.
There are agressive species of smoking and kinds that are inadequate.
It is therefore necessary to explain the patient’s risk of the risk of his type of ransom, to offer to him possible alternatives, to do no need to treat the racoon of prostacity that has no long-term impact on life, and to take place in these cases in the active monitoring of the disease.
Today, a number of men in which the racoon was diagnosed is not treated, because their kind of racoons are not aggressive and doesn't threaten them in life.
We will immediately reject them the active monitoring and we will offer them treatment in the case of disease.
We are still more often and with greater integrity criteria that help us to make decisions which kind of treat and which are not.
I therefore recommend the investigation to absolve.
However, it is important to resolve medical conversation and determine whether appropriate investigation is to be undertaken or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Company, the Movember's tool has been established with a grid that allows the value for and against in accordance with the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
There is no surprising procedure for the prevention of rabbits.
The best means of the risk of disease to take the principles of the health style of life.
It is deemed that if everyone eats healthy and sufficed enough, it would be at 30% of the cases of rabbits.
"If all of them were stopped to buy, this data would be at least 50%," subscribed Andre Beaulie, a Canadian community speaking for the research of the rabbits.
Instead, it is deemed that at least 10% diseases of racoon cause heritage.
Some percentage also remains very unexpected.
For the Canadian company for the research of ransoms, it remains a priority to fight against cutting, even though the number of cups are fulfilled.
Cigarettes are 85% of the cases of fishing.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
That's increasingly hurt human health.
"He's still in Quebec 1,5 million cupcakes," the head of Andre Beaulie.
Rebuilding data: 10 years after the cup is stopped to buy, the risk of death for half of the rack.
Smoothness
Agency and obstacles are according to the SCC another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of the hair, deep smoke and the finger, the egg, the slides and the skins.
"For the investigation, the regular body activity after the whole life of protecting from a smooth steel," adds the report.
Life
The implemented organization recommends also to limit the consumption of the red meat.
In a lot of high consumption, it may bring to higher risk of the exhibition of colouric race.
It is appropriate to take care of the taxes to pay the same.
Conservation of the meat of carcinogenic substances can be carcinogened, supply or solemn.
"They can cause the body cell and lead to the development of rabbits," adds the report.
Vitamines
In the last time, the various scientists measured the relationship between vitamin plugins and rack.
However, the research has not yet been achieved by a single conclusion.
The studies for vitamin E are rerupted according to the SCC.
Although, according to one of them, the risks of rabbits are reduced, other studies are often talking about its increase.
No effects of vitamin D on the racoon are not only indicated.
Mr. Beaulie continues to talk about your fears and previous families with your doctor.
"The investigation doesn't mean that you're gonna have a racoon."
Higgs' boson investigated
The notification of the probable revelation of Higgs' boss called a ship in the year correctly.
There is a view that this boss shares the mechanism that is responsible for all the climates in the universe.
And further it is about the last part of which existence prevents the standard model -- our best or at least the "failure" explaining the minds and the behavior of the substances - however, the empiricals were not yet observed.
However, between physics still doesn't have a degree of sure that it is about the boss of Higgs.
It doesn't seem that we have a full new party that is very like the Higgs boss, as the standard model is proposed.
The new data published this week during the great physical congress in Kyoto are often confirming it, however, all data are still missing to have absolute security.
However, let's imagine that it's about the boss of Higgs, because the risks are as small, and let's see what's actually going to go.
In this world, the law is full of unbelievable, according to which two things cannot be provided in the same time on the same place.
This rule can't be obedient - and do not try to be too comfortable, otherwise you're disturbing.
Although a party physical is a very significant world, there is also a legal law: Paul's exemption principle, according to which two parts cannot kill the same space in the same time, if they are in the same "kvantic state" - this "state" tissue is called to create some of their properties.
Next part of physical parts on two categories.
On one side, we will find coordinated citizens, or fermians that obey Paul’s principle.
And on the other hand, they move boss, according to anarchists, who don't care anything - therefore, not this principle, which means that they can be quietly on the same place in the same time.
These diseases are further divided on two groups according to the device (increasingly wonderful), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley Laboratorys: misions that we leave here without notice, and "silver parts", which are widely natural forces and the bowl of Higgs, most likely, are divided.
However, it is not easy to say that these boss are not such an exotic animal as it could be considered.
If you read this article, it is thanks to the boson with an ordinary banality: photon, or "the part of the light", which is "nonce" electromagnetic powers.
If the party with the electronic box will accelerate or change its direction, "exclude" the electromagnetic field in this specific location, like the cloud covered into the fishery.
From this "extinction" the electrical lens (light, infrared or ultraphylal incidents, etc.), and this lens is nothing other than the photon - and then one of the boss, "positors of power".
Stable fields
It's also with Higgs' boss, just with the difference that it's needing a different field, the Higgs' field to find this boss.
This Higgs field is much, much more stabil than electrical fields; for its excitation, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as well as in the swallows of fish, it is just a lot of big balvan.
For this reason, it is necessary to use so large accelerator of parts as a accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large harmony accelerator with increasing shirts is a crowd with a range of 27 km! - to enable such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field will be able to reveal the relationship between Higgs and Hmt.
With the electromagnetic field, they do not react even all parts or all materials.
Some, for example, makes the magnets, but others don't - a cup of paper, for example, they will never keep themselves on the shipping.
And it also pays that the Higgs field doesn't react all parts: those who do this, they have a certain heat, while others (that as photographs, let's see it) do not.
And Mrs. News asks why all these researchs are what we're going to bring?
Awareness is to confirm the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to deal with the investigation any disagreement between observation and MM proposals.
There are no physicians in addition to a perfect way to find them, because the most smaller difference could open space of "new physical" and appreciate some spaces in the model.
It is necessary to convince that the model has still a large disagreement, does not accept any statement of gravitation (or ha!) or dark temperatures that create nearly 80% of the universe climates (zase oha!).
However, the CERN equipment has not yet appeared.
Research
The reviews of these researchs in each day, Mrs. News and Mrs. News can only be very difficult, but it would have been wrong to think that it would not be.
See: At the beginning of 60 years there were no laser officers in the Bell Laboratorys, nor the idea of revolution, they already chose their job.
They thought scientist use, but nothing else.
Phyzik Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was found in 1960, and who created the first stay of the laser cups (the previous papers were pulse) in 1962, I already said - laser was considered the beginning of such a "player to the lab".
Just imagine it...
Moreover, the application can also cut out from all tools that cover research.
For example, this Willard Boyle created a small light dream in 1969 during his work on the optical operation.
This dream, even though Boyle had not started so planned, now he serves as "eye" of all digital photographs on the world and brought him Nobel's price for physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that actions around the LHC need to change life, but that means that a person really never knows...
Palestinian training - the best way to go out of life... . . Le Devoir
By means of his Commission for a permanent death, Quebec recently entered into the comfortable issues relating to the end of life.
The Debatte should continue immediately, and the proposal of the law is currently clear.
In this basic area there remains a lot of work.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to see this question more details.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Montreagie.
Rakovina's prostace that she was surprised gave him a double-year.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven," he says without emotions on his bed in the house for the political pieces of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came last day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare this," adds.
The sickness did his work: the inscreen disease is able to decline himself to the toalth or to eat himself.
He looks recruitly on the poor sneakers and agrees to help us to eat him.
He's worthy and even sleeping, talking to the unknown ones who stop him, bringing him medicines, offering a cocktail.
Rebellion to normal death.
"My biggest friend is to save that damn, he deceives me," he says.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his medical problem.
"In whole life, a man learns that guys are able to steal," says Peter Brodeur, psychologist in Victor-Gadbois device.
Return to the child's fase is for some people who are unacceptable.
"It's the capabilities of the person," if we accept it, the psychologist says.
According to the opinion of a number of persons who are occupied by political care, the basic moments are reviewed in a self-new kernel of such return.
Patients who are in the house with a political pestilence Victor-Gadbois are all suffering.
Their prognoses are maximumly three months of life.
In this stage, the teams of doctors and sisters who are looking for them don't provide such a "medically" feed.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, it's the worst time to die "with a full knowledge."
But the disease allowed me to find out her children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any friends in my life," he says, "and then he's gonna let us put it on the breeding device.
However, it is still happy in the next days for the last visit of the son of Italy.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, we are in collaboration with the group of welfare provides avoidation of the body with the consumption.
So it seems like a political career that is at hand if it can't do anything else.
That's better for death.
In Quebec, there appears to be a low paliath train of 11 700 citizens.
It's very little if we know that we all die once.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Let's go on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual agreement.
When a man dies, he can give him a brand or peps, according to pain.
The diabetes have no longer to look at the sugar.
And death is here part of every day life.
Yesterday, Mr. X., who died later in the night.
Tomorrow, his son's son's drinks for the number of unclean father.
"We are helping patients as well as their neighbor," says Nathalie Savard, the director of the career service.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, they're going a day after each other, but they're not like one another.
Thirty - twenty - old man who enjoys the last meeting with his family fully based on the pools, while he applies to his number, he dies tragically 60 - year - old man who around his parents, women and two small children after he tested all the opportunities to survive.
"After half a year, there's always three to five leafs that are defined for people with rabbit for 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are coming home in Victor-Gadbois will come from their homes, then 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to the political treatment
It says that 77% of the Canadians have no access to the political peaks, including to the pig that is determined to reduce suffering when the disease grows into the final fashion of their life, to be home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
And several organizations, for example, Victor-Gadbois's house and the Community for the household of the political treatment of the Grand Montreal area, are specialised more excitingly on the incological patients.
And just this basic invasion of health care in Quebec brings that a number of doctors who are specialised at the political treatment includes the law of etangasia and a suitable murder.
Since October, it is manifestly signed by the pipes in the field of political treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which their non-compliance with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the chebecky health system is not sufficient to ensure access to all persons to quality political treatment before it is possible to agree with the equivalent.
As he says, she has recently experienced a patient who had 14 days to be prepared in a serious disease, and no one would do the necessary steps to make it easy.
It's afraid that the patients don't want to die because they do not have a correct problem.
And currently pays a number of oncologs care about their patients to the last hours without regarding an inadequate prognosis.
The hope of Helene Richard's survival was already fully minimized when she left an annually chemotherapy.
When I made my grandfather to end with the medicine, she replied that she was grateful that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And then she told me it's the end!
It doesn't exist all powerful treatment
Dr. Martel rejects that 90% of the patients who are going to die thanks to their observant doctors because they did not satisfy their friends when the political pig was dismissed to them.
But it is necessary to say that the political treatment is not absolutely powerful in the treatment of disease.
According to Elsie Monereau, the directors for political treatment in the Community for the household of the Great Montreal area are 8% of the patients of treatment of disease in 8% of cases.
At the same end of life, the doctors often use a palitary seat that the patient sleeps until the ends, so that it may be sooner or to be given to him.
We can't imagine that this part of suffering we don't have.
The patient that we don't save pain will still have a greater access to the political sediators.
The diseases who don't have a seditive are always say, "I want to die."
But it doesn't always need to mean "I want you to give me etangazie", it means "I want you to save my pain."
The implementation of this report has allowed a grant for newspapers from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Advanced real skandals in Quebec
The Officers of the Road Management, businessers in structural and public works, lobby political parties and experts on Italian mafia are still reporting what they know about a wonderful "system", in which they have structure, State officers, policies, experts and mafias.
This "obor" has come to the chebec payers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has been broken from the time we accepted the basic measures," says ironical Jacques Duchesneau, chebecky messenger and the former police boss in Montreal.
He made the scandal in 2011 on the basis of the excessive monitoring of the medium-profit in accordance with the Treaty on the Building Motor in Quebec, which then the Liberal Chebec Premier Jean Charest approved to long-term costs.
"The report of Duchusneau" confirmed direct connection between the industry, the transparent funding of the parties and the corruption of the State officers.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," says, "the Ministry's transport on the billions of dollars' laws has only been solved," when some people hold on their instincts to get part of them!
The Commission of Charbonneau, "which has brought to the Democracy two olders," adds the hope that it will be "described by some people's integrity."
Stage unit for the battle based on corruption in 2011
The stated unit for the battle based on corruption in 2011 is also introduced in battle with its army government controllers, investigators and analysis.
To the other "Marteau's groups" who were sure that the monstreal "Peny Card" had explicitly dismissed the infringement of the prohibition...
In the past weeks, they made a series of views and claimed to condemnment and corruption of the general employees, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, an elder of one of the business.
The next list has to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just departed from his oldest area of Laval, the third largest Chebec town.
It is surprised that he accepted the payments for public laws.
Formal accusations have also received a transport engineer from Montreal and Italian origin, for example Tony Acccurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito urged unless the Commission explained the "system" mechanism to obtain public laws.
He sold himself in these years 3% of the charges that he received in Montreal, a mediator connected with the mafia, which then transformed the money to the Union Montreal side, for the bottom of the leader of Gerald Tremblay.
At the end of 2000, he was delighted at all parts and offered more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (by approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals who were then in force.
It also recognized that he organized the illegal funding for the old liberal Vice-Premier Nathalie Normandeau.
Requirements with money-based prices
In Montreal he worked a "system" corruption very much.
Gilles Surprenant, an older transport engineer, described it very detailed before the Commission: for ten years he received from the established donors, invitation to the outcome, golf tourages, restauration, hoke rates and cups in total 736,000 dollars to replace the costs of money in which the price was raised.
Other public workers of the transport office agreed that they had left their rewards for 30% to 40% to assess the factors through unrighteous multiple works.
Martin Dumont's old-site organizator then condemned Tremblaye that he had taken the eyes on the combined budget that he led the spring money to his board.
On the basis of these Tremblay departments, the beginning of November, he departed from Montreal to the crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was between the first monstreal messengers who gave a warning signal.
As Rivière-des-Prairies at the east of the island, it has been raised against the sale of the total ground sold for 5 million dollars and sold for... 1,6 million promotors directly in the middle of the expensive trade with disabilities.
70% of the skin money in choice campaigns
The investigation that will finally be started says, "Thanks to be able to understand the functioning of the system of the promoted marvine system to stop the gangrene and start wines."
The process is "bound, but worthy."
We're in the fase of cleaning the ran, but it is necessary to arrange a own research unit in Montreal and to ensure that these serious practices can not be returned.
It's like he's smoking.
Exactly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public workers have rejected hundreds of millions of dollars," but they are concerned with the task of "the officers informed about this lot", if they didn't help them!
It describes that 70% of financing the choice campaigns in Quebec comes from the spinish money, and with irony adds: "I have heard that it's just a lot of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit the payments of the parties to $100, but it does not say, "Those the choice costs are not exceedingly limited, the sprinkling money from the policy will not be lost."
Increasing the complex control of the public laws and financing system: "When we can't be able to drown, if we're aware of the basis of things, we can rebuild on more bases and with greater control and maintenance of the laws."
If this story made the picture of Quebec and Montreal in the garden, Duchesneau recommends all those who are excusing him to look at their own...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this section, you have spent a full new time with PSG.
How do you explain this development?
You can explain that all individuals went to themselves, or just a new PSG size.
Great players came to us.
Every day I'm getting close to them.
Technical team also helped me too much.
Every day these realities allow me to increase the level of games.
And it's easier at the pads.
Everything's very quick in the photoball.
I don't lose my head.
From my beginning in the INF Clairefontaine, I have always seen a single level.
So you use the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti brought...
The pools from this year are usually to play balls on a very high level.
They also know that every train is basic.
And out of that, the player like me, then he's got a bigger rate to escape and wants to give the maximum exercise.
And more than Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relationship with my position.
He has a assistant, like Claude Makelele, who played at the same point as me.
And has Ancelotti's decision in the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all technology.
Today there is no equation between the best European trends.
He has a great experience and has received a lot of tickets with the spring teams.
He also worked with a wonderful player.
According to me, he won another title in Paris.
In January, I solved a quiet conversation with him.
I had a series of disasters after me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my exercise.
How are you looking at the first part of the PSG sequence?
In the 1st list, Lyon collected the white position.
But we're staying in the end.
One of our main targets is Liga's masters: we've been very easy to go to the eight-final.
What's your club in this party's goal?
We're trying to go ahead.
Now it can happen anything.
But we are sure we want to be a hard support for the quality European team.
We want to first play our qualitative group before the Port, so we can play in the room of eight midfinal home.
Can the PSG be in a short-code horizon of a large European club?
It's already...
To become a large European club, Paris must play titles and write to the history.
It's not like this today.
Financial page has PSG means to take this objective.
And wouldn't it be a great success to win in the 1th lens as in the lone room?
Of course, it would be a big deal.
We really want to play a lot of ring titles.
We've been missing enough in the lone season.
In May, we were crying because we had to win.
We had a great room.
We collected 79 points.
It usually pays you're a clear master with 79 points...
Just another club, Montpellier, had more wonderful.
I think it's gonna happen for years.
Although on the title, the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a weapons available to shoot them.
Do you think the media are waiting for too much from the PSG?
It's not usual to expect from us a lot of regards what happened here and what we have players.
We're just accepting it.
It's the fact that when we're going home to Troyes 4:0 and we'll still find something that's going to tell us in news, it's not exactly nice.
The man asks what people can want more than you.
Of course it's not going to play 4:0 every week.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up the horror style.
You need time to build a team.
We proved my masters to play.
Look at Manchester City, which has not already been able to go to the second section, and then they have also invested large parts!
In view of the invested summary, you will have 15 points of smoking before others!
That's the other clubs and the French ligue.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which had not been too far in the lone street, were sent to another phase with the new PSG.
This shows how one line is wonderful.
I hope we can smile in May and say that in the midst of all the difficulties, we're going to win.
It seems like PSG in all the cases of the Abraham's Golden Exemption.
It's good that it says there's a "dependence on Zlatan".
That means Abraham's very perfect and he gives a lot of hairs.
That's why he came here and shows that it's the stars of 1 ligs.
Everywhere he went, he showed that he was a big player, a world star.
In our team, we respect people and players.
And he respects people around him.
What he got is really extraordinary.
It also led others to increase their own level of games.
Thiago Silva, who is the best transparency in the world, also allows others to grow near himself.
How did you live Euro 2012 with French representation?
It's like a crazy.
I wanted to play this tourist.
I couldn't play as I imagined.
But I did it, and I went out of that stronger.
Today, I'll also play a good challenges in the representative.
And in this I hoped that I've been going to represent.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we need ourselves to be an example.
How are you looking at the first month of Didiera Deschamps in the national team?
They call for him the results.
We're on a good place in the MS qualification.
The trenner chooses exactly, it's a nearby player, and it's able to monitor for winning.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has obtained his goal because we qualified Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings our team to Brazil.
Is there a restriction of (1:1) of October 16 in Spain with a solid exit?
This weapon added to us self-consciousness.
We all fighted for the team.
Before this shock in Spanish, I didn't kill such a shock for my carrier.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sold without bank
All negative of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for treatment between recipients.
As in the framework of these technologies, most often true, here is to feel a clear political view: the convincement of the staying financial system established on bank monopoles is led to financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents as a virtual money (representable for dollars, euro...), a safe transformation protocol similar to the BitTorrent that allows the change of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers entered into the network has already been registered £ 200 000 transactions.
A thousand web pages almost accept bitcoins as a donor or as a payment.
Curses of bitcoin first received maximum of 30 dollars (23 €) in June 2011, five months later, two months later, he moves to the border of $10 (the front of the currency is mentioned on the bitcoincharts.com page).
In comparison with the world's exchange for real money or financial products, it is nothing imponant.
The European Central Bank (ECB), however, is interested in the report of the virtual financials that have been issued in October.
Bitcoin marks "the most successful virtual money", "concurrent dollars and euro" and "free of normal money".
Bitcoin is from other types of virtual money less than that it is as "creditity" used for processing video games, which a person gets a game or can buy (and replace back).
The Facebook social network also developed a similar system.
Every month, but the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the deposits networks of the books of regular accounts, controllers, money emissions and selling and selling.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is in reality between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment to ensure anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by the certificate system with a double key.
The network can verify the right of transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, you can continue to ensure that the bitcoin changed exists in the public account books of ordinary accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase shall be concluded in writing of this new transaction to this book.
It is conducted by the solution of the mathematical task given to computers whose solution is a temporary central banker shall have the right to write this additional line.
It is one of the phase of the file resolution; including transforming a large file to shorter and single digital print.
The computer's "come" this new transaction and add a number to it, then the whole "moving".
The target is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zero at the beginning).
As this number is found, others are easily controlling his rights.
The transactions will then be displayed in the string of all other transactions; any change will be made to change the otics.
If the user wants to pay two times for the same money very quickly (to ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be left because each of them has a different pressure.
The computer that will solve the call will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward shall be divided regularly to two, probably at the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in the move is so limited to 21 million, but they can share them to a million, so the space for the margin here is...
The difficulty of the specified task is also increased with a growing rate calculation.
The network has already been busy with her disasters and falls.
Web pages that safe for Bitcoin were attacked and arrived to decline saved bitcoin.
"The employment is not related to the same protocol," ensures Pierre Noizat, based on Paymium, a company for the payment of real money that uses Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the options for the payment of the skin money through this anonymous service.
But this problem is paying and ready.
Significant players such as Wikipedia refuses the gifts of this conscience.
Others, like WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizman's establishment recently analysed the book of regular accounts and demonstrated that at least 80% of the bitcoins were not obtained.
In November, it was started by the "great snows".
John Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, works with bitcoin changes to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who also is the author of the pedagogical books relating to these money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paythonia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or an uncontact placement mobile, but it uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are better.
The notebook also controls his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for commercials where you don't need to install new terminals or software.
It's enough to share the address that you can "fotograf and recognize" calls Pierre Noizat, which ensures that he has already thousands of users.
The general movement of the hierarchical systems and the transition to the horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin seats, it's still a minute, but in 2013 it's possible to be a decision."
The ECB, in its report, also provides the review of various risks considered as higher if this type of money is successful.
We went out of Afganistan.
What's going on?
The French units left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Chapter and Surobia).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It's time for a African army to overcome control over his territory and to choose their own future and not expect all of us.
The most recent people have suffered in the African Foreign, which we punished because we considered them terorists.
And We also came to the 88 of the killed soldiers, and all those who were disgraced and destroyed.
The Talibans are part of the border extremists, the former leaders who have gone to Pakistan, but often are the foreigners who refuse the presence of the foreign army as in the Soviet times.
They just want to protect their old and archaic traditions, even though they were added to them a Jewish, Pakistans, Arabs, Uzbekis, Tadjikis.
Now, the tolerants and sometimes help of local raisers, but if western forces are loaded, their support will be excited.
The department of the French units from the Niirab base, which I have seen from the top of the mountains located by the French monkey, has been assembled.
The conventions of stones and the pancertained vehicles came to Kabulu without attacking the airport of helicopter.
From the end of 2014, the Talibans will not be so active in Kabul.
Since their instable procedure in 1994 to 1996, the conditions were significantly amended.
Cabul was empty that time, and the land was in blood and fire in the results of wars between various groups.
Their supervision of the country was then considered as their type of freedom, return to security.
The Africans paid the price for the darkness of those strangers who were fully controlled by the Al-Ká'ida organization, however, their situations were not improved in our time.
Some scientists, African governments, and modern talibians are agreed to maintain women in a subordinate position.
The main evaluators of war against the Soviet Units returned to power in 2001.
They became chefters, strengthened States fields that sold as structural lands of Iran and Pakistan, and used large American laws for subdoctors.
They were discredited; most of them were never in battle.
According to what I heard in the campaigns, people like the government that they will not create more bad.
A number of young people want to get away as they go away to those who could use American happiness: the capital's business is significant.
Youths are already built a war and a linked ideal.
While Iran or Pakistan had recognised the modern world and its expenditures were deemed.
Almost 65% of the population is younger than 25 years; in Kabul, 5 million people live in the present, five total populations.
In the cities, the state schools are full, girls and boys walk there.
These young people will need to provide work, they will not want to return to the darkness of the previous parties or to corrupt some representatives.
All, including armed oppositions, like mobile phones; TVs and Turkish series showing modern world, observe everywhere.
The army is now.
Will the offices that are set in her chair be considered legitimate?
Some leaders fight against the Soviet Army have already renewed provincial millions that will be without control of central power.
Afganistan, the rural country with strong local identity should be satisfied by the decentralisation of the west states, but the United States wanted to change it to the centralised state with a strong president's influence, so that it was able to discharge the position of the premier that had already been taken from the setting in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the opportunity of the options planned on April 2014.
However, his country is explicitly attached to the foreign aid since 50 and last years.
No industry could be renewed, no transition works, no essential investment system has been corrected.
Everything is imported; nothing is done, but only fruit and green.
The presence has a private initiative.
Three decades in the country destroyed would be the necessary government control of infrastructure.
It was aware that Afghanistan has a serious increasing riches.
And it just used the feeling that western States were just because they had it.
Without energy to process yellow rounds or mills on the place and without the transport of surounds over mountains, but no difficulty of divergence can be able to do.
The Chineses have almost left the middle of Mess Aynak and left international archeological teams (for support of the World Banks) to investigate the largest budgetary area to maintain the role of the most important employees in the entire provincies.
In one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan will also be required to renew normal relations.
Department of French war units was finished on November 20.
The new agreement on cooperation provides forward to continue regular assistance: girls and girls lyceas, French Catholics on universities, French institution, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support of archeological delegations.
Since 2009, the initiative was "gaining heart and souls" trying to handle an unnecessary task of help and military activities, in which the framework of which the "protection and army steps" of the Ministry of Protection (Chimic) was rejected in 2012, but has received thanks to the unrecommended French non-governmental organization of success in the field of common interest and steps for landing in the fields of mountains.
These works in which the number of local employees have been achieved have helped to smooth the raising: exploitation, sources, long water, adjustment, fruit trees, the protection of the grounds and the extension of trading boards.
What reminder do we take after two billion euros of military expenditure?
More exhaust budget would contribute to improve local life conditions that are very significant in these fields, which are often located in the sea higher than 2 000 m.
The majority has received decades of written requests on a lot of agricultural assistance from local community in Capisa Province.
In order to save these agricultors from the resort of rural groups, they will have an invisible aid in their efforts that would be directly controlled and addressed directly.
Hard work in Egypt
President Muhammad Mursí went to another part of the poker.
While Egypt remains the most separated in his history because of the statement of the statement that temporarily makes him unlimited authority, he decided to play a vacation.
In the Mediterranean, without regarding the opinion of all others, the Office meetings shall apply the conclusions.
A week ago, the head of the State has made this meeting two more months to complete the necessary works.
At least two years he uses Egypt’s provisional text, which has been so many times completed, which enhances the stability of the country and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative only has increased the divorce of the country.
In view of the opposition of the President, he is in his "autcratic deliri", "forgiving his word" and "the law."
However, his employees ensure that it's a means to attach the fastest and political crisis and to accelerate the transitional process.
Two weeks should be reviewed.
It is about a very short time-term step that allows Brothers to depart from the text of the Egyptians to explain articles after the article.
For the President, it is also a way to reach national and democratic legitimity, while all the countries reject protests.
As he confirmed in the talk for American weekday Time, Muhammad Mursy seems to be convinced that the United States will vote for.
Especially because this rapidly organized vote makes the Egyptian people before the ultimum: "Accept my text, or let me leave unlimited powers," which, in other cases, should be concluded after the approval of new provisions.
And in this special view yesterday, 85 messengers of the establishment meeting with the greatest islamists were approved.
The majority of liberals were failure.
In the half November, before the statement of the statement, they struck the doors with the ability to make their opinions.
Human rights, citizen society or religious minorities have followed their steps.
In order to be achieved, 11 persons from the number of replacers were quickly completed last morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brother.
Then it is not surprised that the provisions were often excluded.
The comments continued to stop that one of the non-speaking sports had been played around the day... hours for prayer when some members of the Committee stopped the view that the hours of the meeting were not correctly set up.
The text on which it was voted yesterday is based on 234 articles.
The objective of general attention, Article 2 is finally agreed with the version of the provisions from 1971 and states that "the resources of the guard rights are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which is the introduction of the Islamic law one of the basic requirements, have confirmed that the terms of "reports" are replaced by the term "justice" which would allow more appropriate application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article is not prepared is the mark of their good will and respect for the other part of the Egyptian company.
"Crimination" means liberals that see only a linguish problem.
In accordance with them, the islamism of the institutions is carried out by other articles.
In particular, Article 220 of the Council Affairs University Al-Azhar, particularly for the control of the laws agreement with the guard law.
According to the Egyptians Sophie Pommiers, it's amazing because "the bodies that are allowed to express are not chosen and they have no democratic legitimity.
You can see the beginnings of the theocracy."
The freedoms are still more discovered that the next University director should be less dead than that remaining.
"Therefore there was no specific religious consequences.
With this point, Egypt remains a framework of the citizen state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not damn, but universe workers, a number of them studied in French schools," the peaceful attention of Alexis Blouet, who prepares the work for the establishment of transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "the negotiations may exist in respect of the expenditure of Article 220 because the terms used in it are in the religious dictionary.
It is particularly link to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, name. red].
And in the future, there can be a question on which measure civil judges are competent to make it out."
The yesterday approved text, except religious pages, is very criticised because of the various powers made by the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothership continues to have their expression limits to resist the past mode.
Another sport place: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the advice of the representatives of the army, the budget shall not be verified to implement Parliament, but the National Council of Defence.
Then they will not be prohibited in military courts, as it has required a commitment to protect human rights.
This Agreement shall be discussed in accordance with the text that is based on them against freedom, of its doubts.
The courageous act of disorder is preserved and the urgent is further prohibited, which may have serious results for the freedom of explanation, especially for pressure.
In addition, no article remains a protective woman, not exceeded Heb Morayef from the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to it, it is the only basis of the requirement of the conformity referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous case.
While the President of the Egyptian had to go out yesterday in the TV, the demonstration is planned today.
The staffs of the state's head will be shown on the Sabbath.

Turists, on the word

On the path, it's better to take your money not in yours, but in the dollars you can easily change for the shekels (they's $1 close to $3,8 shekel).
The town transport is particularly buses, but in Jerusalem the speed travels and in the city of Haifa is the only line of metro in the land with six stations that associates the bottom city with the top.

"Great and powerful" reports to Moscow: emigrants keep money on language
While the messengers and human rights protection are still discussing the law on the required language tests, they have already appeared undertakers who sell the "limited" certificates.
To Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities will come every year 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are located in Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan, Turkish.
Their only goal is to make enough money for family support.
On 1 December he entered into the effectiveness of the law, in which each migrant would have to make a test from the knowledge of Russian language.
This rule shall therefore be paid only for those who are intended to work in the sector of services, live and community, lifestyle and small commercial sale.
However, FMS promises that the appropriate tests will be required for all visitors in time.
However, tests will be made not only of language knowledge but also of the Russian history and of the principles of law.
The knowledge of the language will also be required to confirm to reach and extend work authorisation.
The exception is paid only for the citizens of the country where Russia is official language.
The law does not apply any persons who had successfully achieved and received academic diploma to SSSR in 1991.
Use, jurisdiction and protection of rights
The network of experimental locations will work under the Russian Institute of the Russian language, the United Nations friendship between the nations, the Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petrohrada and other Russian High Schools.
The migrants can provide tests in all cities; now in Russia is opened more than 160 such centres.
The initiative on the implementation of testing supported and the sentences of State pain and FMS (Federal migration services).
But before the law entered into a validity, the human rights were able to make a number of times in the pressing question: and what would it actually bring?
What will change the responsibility to know the language for Russia and for the only visitors?
So, in particular, the migrants respond to the migration services - it is allowed to reduce the number of people who suffer in the consequence of the "otrock work".
Many people are today talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explaining the President of the FMS Russian FMS in Tadjikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be already started before their department.
Only the organizated advice system allows 90% to resolve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems affect the emigrants without call, without education who don't know languages and have no medicine view.
Unknown tongue - says Zebelev - is the future migrant sent down to the thresholds of unbelievable people who will help him to ensure "command" to be inherited, holy residents, in which he and ten others, as he himself, to lose all months without food and documents and to drown for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of interest from our migrant workers.
"In their own power they promise one of them, but after they come, they'll be able to cut their passes, they don't pay the promised rods," confirms the head of the main taxi mission MS Tolib Sarpov.
Don't give it!
At least that many citizens of the Central African Republic, who are intended to go to Russia, recognize that they don't only know the language of the country where they want to get, but they don't have experiences even with the given work.
Of course, it isn't even their sins, as often difference: only very little Turkmens, Uzbeki, Tajik can allow you to get at least the basic education.
Since their families need something to disturb the children, unlike the fact that they have to be nicely clothed, around and save in school.
As children are achieved to the productive age, the first opportunity is to be made for work.
Unknown tongue is hard - they recognize.
"You feel decreasing and less valuable."
It is true that, with regard to the law of language tests, human rights have shown the protection of one important thing.
Testing will be executed only in the migrants who have legal positions.
If they don't have him, they won't fix the tests, nor will there be any other official work.
Most migrant workers live as before in Russia are illegal.
"Come welcome or unautorised input has been deleted."
Many of the coming workers say that to get official status in our country is not easy.
The cause is burrocratic transactions and all these languages difficulties.
Legislation besides the money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubbers.
But the false record can get quickly and only one and half thousand.
The Russian police employees know that we have false documents, without registering, and with the entire case of exhibition.
"There are one hundred, two of the cigarettes, thee," he shared with the newspapers about their experiences in Tadjikistan, umed Chushkadamov.
"Now, don't be weird, buy a bitch."
In the first day of the implementation of the language law, false witnesses of migrants were not only.
The FMS employees have already rejected several false witnesses on the fulfillment of language tests.
Feeded evidence are printed on normal color printers.
Of course, the new leaders were not very hard: each of the migrants in hope that it was so easy with tests solving, payed for this document seven thousand rubbers.
It's two and half times higher than solving the official test: this will be the migrant workers of three thousand rubbers.
The main work of the future is to ensure that the system before corruption is that the workers could not simply buy evidence, including government officers and human rights protection.
The Government authorities still can promise for foreign workers who did not first conduct tests, needed time to solve the rate of Russian language.
For visitors who are not Russian, the work in areas where they do not require a active action with people.
MVD (the Ministry inside) does not include the illegal market with weapons
The share of criminal acts with legally maintained weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia provides a proposal for law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the government authorities on recent events: thus the cases of shoes that were concerned without victims, and the masker prepared to the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, whose consequences were lost seven people.
The police wants to deactivate dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can get the licence for weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This thinking supports the head of the Committee of Depression for Security and War against Corruption of Irina Jarovaja, which promised that the changes of weapons will be submitted by the State Spirit in the near future.
Not everybody is satisfied with that Russian State authorities are trying to handle the problem with the way "slove traveling".
In the network, the open letter, which cars - managers of various society-shooting organizations, requires to refuse the law.
The percentage of poverty with registered weapons is minimum, reported Vasilij Lesnikov, lawyer and criminal talking with the Russian BBC editing.
According to the Statistics of the Internal Ministry for six months in 2012, 142 criminal acts were made with the use of guns of the registred officers of the inner office, while all 1168 thousand criminal acts were fulfilled for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the legal laws in civil weapons are not accepted to the trusters to move to the "new" market.
According to their words, we can now find a free weapons in Moscow for lower price.
Currently, the Ministry's internal states that the situation with the expansion of illegal weapons is under control.
Additives: from officers
"The Black" market with weapons is based on several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Barañic, who worked ten years in the employment of the Ministry of School and General Square.
Screenshot page accepting weapons
First of them - "The army or military path", it means a weapon that was declined during the battle on the Cavcase.
"The weapons have broken the Russian officers and the soldiers," says Baranika.
Another type of "new weapons" are locked by weapons in security power representatives.
The Baranec explains that there is also the ransoms of police staff and the weapons locked directly from the officers of the officers in criminal management.
The illegal "private" is achieved to sale of military staff.
In many military boards, there are often explosions.
"It is shown that some fires were based significantly - to hide such a mank," says the old soldier.
The story offers the word Barance and the manufacturers of the weapons.
"In the present, private weapons, which are not competitive on the international market, are now involved, and equipped with weapons that are added to the Black Market, including Moscow," says the representative.
The next source of the "new" market is the passion.
Especially the large number of guns and cars come from poor countries, such as Kirgistan.
"It's their production, sometimes weapons are produced in a small floor, and the mafia that organized their floor production," explains the ancient soldier.
Where's the gun?
The experts counted the nearest part of the individual resources of the non-legal weapons on the "near" market.
The report on this issue was processed in 2011 in the analyse Centre of the problems and the development of public management.
Specialistically, they discovered the statements of the Ministry Internal and the Russian Statistic Office, Criminological literature and the data of public data portals concerned on the weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons, the investigators, come from military and executive authorities.
The half of all of the weapons was raised up on the black market "the official workers whose work is connected with weapons," says in the report.
According to the data that are available to researchers, 17% of weapons of weapons of weapons, in 14% of the cases have come to the weapons in their production, 5% is "near archeology".
Provider-consultant of one of the businesses with weapons that asked us not to see his name is convinced that the weapons found in black archeology are not already buying - they're just too old.
At least, as it says, the vessels are sold for new challenges directly to military staff.
The employer buys a unit, for example, the TT guns.
You're gonna buy the weapons with him, and he'll sold it through the ball.
"That brings her to the city and sells her for 900 euros for a couple with two officers," she says.
"The right is that the police is good in the picture, and therefore, when they start to build a plan in the publication of criminal acts, they will carry out control costs in businessers with illegal weapons," adds the advice.
"Come in Luxembourg's area."
The selling with the most party of the self-shooter is located through their knowledge.
I've visited web pages and blogs until he's getting a guy who gave me a chance to go to the "Provider" platform where he's gonna be a man who's bringing me to the "cook", where we're going to work together.
I've learned the price of the price.
War reports Viktor Barañic
If I want to get a weapons, I need a known one who knows the way out, she tells the soldier. - I have such a known, but I don't trust him.
The sales on the market are, but there's also need to go, hypothetically, from Mr. Ivan Ivanovicz, who asked me to tell me that the daughter has fallen out of the dawn."
And now I'll get out of the man I'm sure.
He's also added to me, because he knows I don't do it.
The starters are looking for various ways of weapons.
The military Viktor Barañic tried to buy an illegal weapons in half of 90 years when he worked to publish this subject.
The schema has not changed according to his word.
They gave him a album with photographs where it was "all what you thought."
"I felt like in the Luxembourg," remembers the soldier.
The buying, according to the word Baragner, they don't offer a wheel in the pytle - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, I just don't just buy -- we're going with the sold in the forest and we're going to put it down.
"They give me a chance to shoot, and when I convinced that the weapon's shooting well, we'll start to work," describes the proceeding of the knowledge.
Consumer
The searchers will bring you on the web sites and groups on the "Contact" where they are offered to buy the weapons "for various purposes".
There are no documents or personal meetings needed for this.
"State to have a number of money," they write in the title of the web pages "Cooper the weapons of battle or automatic."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and questions.
And you're saving the unbelievable?
"Obviously without licence," asked the user "Ivan" (right is stored).
"I'm buying T.Moskva" - it forms the "Fedorenkov".
Federal Security Service recently decided a large network of web sites and people who are going to buy a military weapons can shoot a lot.
People play as hungry fishing for the ground and then get the cars on Sibiria.
Military report and higher military officer Viktor Barañic
I heard about such schemes: web pages are usually registered for the border of Russian laws.
The people's gonna take the ships.
Buying payment through banks.
"In response to him to sold photos and descriptions of the weapons where the weapon is hidden," reports the print speaker of the non-governmental organization "right to the weapon" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Barañic confirms that you can stay without weapons and respect your offices.
Federal Security Service recently decided a large network of web sites and people who are going to buy a military weapons can shoot a lot.
"The people play as hungry fish for the ground, and then they've got smokes on Sibiria," confirms.
Makarov for 100 dollars
When you buy an illegal gun, you will pay the payment of the employees usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to the word Dmitria Kislova, from the non-governmental organization "Right on the weapons" you order the Macarov's guns for $100 to 300.
You have to wait for a month and half months.
The weapons shall be distributed from the stocks to the long-term storage through the provisions of the Middle Article.
According to the official statistical Agency, the number of these criminal acts in Russia was entirely 7%, and 22,9 thousand cases, and the number of clear offences and weapons, weapons, exploitation and exhaustive equipment was reduced by 7,8%.
In the United States, Fifthood and Supermarket Workers
Works on the base called "McDonald" will go to the fourth of all American teenagers
In the last days in America, it brought a low protest against the low-markets in the Wallmart's hypermarkets and in the restaurants of a quick range, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
Then no one can imagine whether this flash moves to the nineth field or if it's soon disappeared.
The entire action supports departments and numbers of Lewis society organizations.
Furthermore, the increase of smooth payments that are achieved by workers in Walmart and in the rapid exploitation systems, is the objective of the protest organizators to achieve the creation in their policy organisations.
Now this economic sector is practically unreasonable by the employee.
46 cents per year?
The actions started last week after the Thanksgiving Day, in the named "The Black Fifth", when the organs of living self-productors in America, reached millions of citizens and in some cases were carried out and was carried out.
In this day, some workers of Walmart in the world worked at 2,2 million people left their workers and demonstrated with the assembly and the left activities of the national transnational trade charts, which are defined by people with lower and central classes.
Walmart sells everything throughout the world, from the full over the woods and the car battery until the shipping, the birds and the milk.
The products in its sales are average of 8% to 27% length than in large supermarkets.
That is why many employees with lower employees in the sale of Walmart sold only in the work.
Availability and sorts of goods have made from Walmart's chain one of the largest companys in America.
According to the critical words, Walmart can allow you to sold goods so easily because it just pays a little bit of his employment.
They also take care of bad work conditions, such as the absence of automatic vehicles or manual scanners.
The Demonstrators on the "near fifth" required the increase of the payments and assured that the costs for health insurance provided by companies have grown from 30 to 100 dollars a monthly.
The typical worker Walmart gets $9.5 per hour, but it doesn't respond to high expenditure, says the employees.
Scientifics from California University in Berkeley admit that if Walmart increases the average rate of 12 dollars per hour, this company will be $3,2 billion each year.
It's a average of 1,1% more than this company is based on the payment now.
If the Walmart company moves the increase of the middle entirely on the market of consumers, each visit will be sold only 46 cents more.
For a year, the lawyers will lose about $12,39 more than today.
Walmart's companies show that the protest was only in nine countries and company should not make practically no troubles.
"The Black Fifth" in the vending company remained from 8 hours of evening to the fourth to the north of the next day, and during this time, Walmart sold about 5000 goods for a second.
She's totally carried out in the black fifth, at least 100 million transactions.
The Officer of Dan Fogelman introduced a conversation on the link website of Huffington Post, that the workplace left the whole "minder than five" of Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "for more medium without", which was organized by the offices.
"It's an unrecognised board!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not a commercial house of Walmart (they are not too far in this progress city, and therefore there are nearly not), but "McDonald" and another leaving restaurant.
McDonald says he's sold billions of portions, and then you don't even pay your unbelievable disease and doesn't pay you exactly for your honourable work!
Jumane Williams, member of the city Council in New York
In the present time, the minimum rate for work in accordance with the federal laws and the provisions of the State of New York 7,25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants have a progressive increase in this field, but only lowly, and in the middle of their employees in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this dear city, nobody's worse in this town.
I don't understand how you can exist for such money in New York.
The employment at McDonald is at least fourth American teenagers who work after school on party accounts and live with their parents.
Just a few people see his main source of life or plans to stay there.
I'm still in the conversation with the McDonald employees who are surprising that they must live from these money and sometimes even cut off their children.
On the other hand on the Wall Street Journal, the comment, which the author recognizes that it is unreasonable to have children, if you don't know how you're taking them.
Protest participants started in 6:30 morning at the "McDonalda" at the 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, requested to get at least 15 dollars per hour, which is more than the double of their current minimum measures.
They also requested to be established in the shopping of rapid excursions.
The United States laws are prohibited to ensure the establishment of abortion organisations and to maintain the activities of abortion and forgiving.
On the other hand, they'll only make it easy for life.
However, enforcement in the rapid exploitation of the organisation is also compatible with objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is usually high fluctuation of employees.
Not matched
In this day, the deep protests were also achieved in the number of other milk restaurants of Manhattan.
The explanation of this action was in the South meeting at the "McDonalda" near Times Square, where there came some local democratic policies, especially a member of the city Council of Jumane Williams, who said, "McDonald" says that he sells billion portions, and then you don't even pay for a disease and doesn't pay you correctly for your poor work!"
Demonstrants also attended support of other prominent New York Democratics, such as the candidate at the town of Bill de Blasio, who said, "We have to go together to support fisheries workers so that they get just rewards for their work and economic prosperity as each newspaper serves!"
As it described by the newspaper New York Times, it was the biggest action of his kind in the history of the American Sherry's speed-up.
But there was only a few hundred people in her, even though they were not all of them a quick accommodation employed in New York for ten thousands of people.
Whether this event becomes a secure that leads the floor of mass smoke, it's still increasing.
"I'm gonna give the brain to smoke in the middle of the middle."
In the middle of modern technology, virtual reality is the popular development of reality; in the last time, it means the meaning of the world, especially through the border of special branches.
At the beginning of the year at his age conference, the Google Working model of this newspaper was announced in November that the request for the corresponding patent was also granted Microsoft company.
With a conversation with the interactive 3D technology technology in Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim, it explains that the scientists of this company are very early.
Love is a perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in air with hot hands, the creation of virtual public prostration.
- Please tell us the framework, what's your research group?
- We're talking about human interactions with machines, but we're trying to move the borders of this interaction.
The human is still looking at the stage of work with pixels on the screen, at least sometimes the screen of the white.
We want to see 5-10 years before and prevent significant changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect snippets - it's a step forward, and at least no Xbox is not on sale without Kinect snipers, because for all, it's very interesting to control through gest.
- What's waiting for us in the future?
- Not as Kinect's system has transmitted interactions to physical level, very much interactions still goes on the screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input rate has improved (system accepts more data), but the output rate is still not particularly.
We are trying to change this, we actually work on 3D display systems based on various technologies including projectives.
It's necessary to leave the computer world to our physical world, to make it more real.
However, it is necessary to meet not only users but also space around him.
Then we will be able to fulfill virtual objects in a lot of appropriate form.
And in the first--wheel with those stupid virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vote control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it?
- Of course, he can't think of all of it - he raises a particular question because we don't always want to inform others in our area about our activities and purposes.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the control of the devices on public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about the plots, but only about such shoes, short.
Gesta would not take a camera of the device, but a frame that would look at the moves of bones and swallows.
He's still big, but theoretically can reduce him to the size of the cups of the horse.
However, in general, the future provides the type of control, such as gesto + voice.
- How about that?
- How do you ask me, for example, to give you this limonad?
You'll tell it, and you'll show it right now.
- I'm just just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very nice to recognize.
- So you want to build the user to apply what can't be in the present moment or can't the machine?
- It's not really necessary, but it's a single approach.
I think we need to work in the near future, especially on the development of new types of snipers, which will be able to overcome human reactions.
This may be, for example, the laser snipers that provide directly good deep resolutions, it is very important.
If you have to talk about your work with the Xbox Sensors Kinect, what are your requirements for modern camera?
Isn't there enough solution today, deep or something else?
- In the basis of the present generation, it's what we can separate in our work on a tridimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 Megapixels speed 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the single Megapixels, but as mother and depth.
In the present view of the things, all the current technologies are inadequate for us -- it adds the work of algorithm designers.
So we have to have a memory not only the differences of X and Y, but also Z.
So very important is the speed, the number of photos per second.
Human moves are directly dynamic and current data tones 30 photographs per second are just a little, especially for gesta.
Stephen Betishes from our Laboratory in Redmond made a snippet with a set-up processing in length 1 to 100 ms, including the current, serious snipers are close to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everybody understands how it affects the interactions of a man with a machine.
For me, it would be a very useful equivalent of such equipment, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some pictures for a second more.
- And the higher number of cameras isn't necessary?
- In the Kinect system, three "cams" are now used from which one is actually infrared sender and the other - accepting the retract signal.
And the third camera -- it's actually a normal dream of the visible space.
This doesn't use to establish the depth of the object.
The biggest number of cameras could be able to resolve the problem ...
Or to disturb him because he would increase the required estimates.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system of Kinect, playing the location of the camera and see how it will help us to determine the 3D position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (in the difference of Google) didn't represent publicly his bracelet.
You don't think that if it's about the use of the technological extensive reality through special branches, is it one of the most promised platforms?
- Of course, walking and not yet holding smartphones in the hands broken, it's not very appropriate, but I think the most stronger variant would like reality extension when it could be possible on the basis of clouds platforms to override any time from the smartphone, the project display and the next round.
Bryle - it's a very personal device, which is their power (see only you), and currently also hardness - extended reality on the basis of the fire you don't allow to work on virtual objects currently with other people.
- Imagine that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is not only to Tony Stark in the "Iron Man", but also the normal killer.
There is a problem on which critics often show: There is no doctrine reception!
The hands don't feel anything!
What response is your group preparing for this call?
- In my proposals, I'm often saying that the extensive reality is the seventh after being going through the interaction between human and the machine.
I think the fulfillment of the heat weapons could be a huge range of eight.
Then one of the interesting tricks is used - using the other hands as a certain type of base for displaying.
It's a wonderful way to sign the threat!
But there are also technology that are really involved to add the "images in the air" - such as interference of several ultra-language cards in the definited point where the skin is located, calls the humidity feeling, but it is still very low - as if you're focal on the board.
It is also available to the increasing effects of the nervous ends in the bottoms - also the promised direction.
- You've been trying to cover the brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we've never been trying.
There is further calls that will be fighting longer - as a person who is physically in a very comfortable space to believe that he turns open, practically unless-- we also work on the concept of travel treatments (including not as in clubs), moving platforms and also large colds.
If the brain smoking is a goal, it's a job for many years.
That's what works for virtual reality so applied to researchers -- many things are in simple starts.
Victoria in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the proceeding of the "Petrohrads' Vorgard" project, the new citizens who are in the field are an advanced culture and science.
On the top of the list, there were already significant positions of the Petrohradad span, which are overridden by the town's border, often recognize in Europe, and not have achieved the universe.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is a great chief Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a young man who is all clothed in the Red which you met here in the Russian Museum, here at the West Garden, here in modest hospitals and on the vernices.
Cyril Miller's images whereever they are designed, they always apply the data of the signs.
Cyril Miller is one of the pure social and philosophical petrohrad explorers, the creation of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a wonderful man of petro-hrad's front of the end of 80 and the beginning of the 90s.
Besides that he is a citizen, his revelation on the streets makes a smile on the face of the citizens, he increases all the relief.
Recently he took a flashing and became a petro-hard flashinger, because he saw all his godly life, philosophy and images.
- Cyril, why are you going through the whole city in the red, not in the yellow or in the tourist?
- I chose a red color as a designer who lives with a view and image.
In this world, it represents a red compromiss color between artist, image and publicity.
It's likely to pay that everything that is just a little different from the green, it's agressive, and makes the bad properties.
But my officers are intended to be able to talk.
The whole story of my executive acts is especially the invitation to discuss.
And when did you understand you have to be a artist?
- In the exhibition of the culture house in Germany, where my job was established.
I understand what's my way.
Then, I didn't understand the field of old free non-official arts and new, free types of artists.
I've met with the arts of new bottles, with post-gases who brought us to Pushkin's 10, and the other bottles were not.
It loves me to divorce, clothing, music, all branches except words.
- And that's all served in your art-clinice... - I was important to feel in the Center of Peterburk, where they should be gathered all the best powers of creature.
In 1995, I was located in Pushkins 10, and there was still a musical club, a bohemic club, a Peterburk Bohemia's house.
There were many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Schnura brought with the "Ucho Van Gogha" project.
Schnur and his friends were singing under a single song, dressed in the attached trikotes, in the middle of them Igor Vdovin, who is now in the way.
When the head started playing alive, she became Leningradem.
Trachtenberg led a lot of hali-galian time programs.
We gave them Trachtenberg, so he started his great carrier, the basic education and a fine preparation from us.
Gallerie "D 137", club "Gribyoedov - it's a dozen Art Clinic.
They're gone here our workers and staying hosts.
I'm a hero in the past century, when the culture has signed something else.
In 2000, the investigation was organized in print, the special price was "Man in our city."
In the name of the "Start Year" I was called me, so he ended my top.
In new times, according to old rules, I am a man of truth, honor and culture in the past century.
In the present years, it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristics in a recognisible way.
- Many of my pictures - these are the hites in which the present and pronikacy are alive occupied.
I'll have a program design "Russ Museum in Klaunech".
The clubs are the overtime category.
Before I was a society, today it's so painful and horrible.
But in the clusters it's all swallowed, it's tragic.
I love great, I have great ideas.
For example, to save the world by the way of total transparency in the challenges.
Today, people are seen by clothing, orientated on the external mechanism, not on the internal man.
Or maybe he can't give him his hand and he needs to put him into his face.
And the claim will be removed by the surface.
- We've seen you recently in the role of the city flashineter. - The culture city should have such a hero.
And who should be her if I'm not?
- And can it be a nice commercial science?
- Today, it should be a commercial, useful science, tattoo, sweet.
It's going to disappear the culture.
Before people stayed in fools, they loved one, just one of the other people.
Today, everything has been divorced on microshops, today is very hard to enjoy all.
I'm not a studolar banker to love all of them.
Today, we need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And to Stasu Michajlo, there's a few thousand signs!
- They're coming to him, there's a sexy social sherry.
And at the culture, 300 people will come and 10 thousand of them will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything will be worthy.
I have fans, the main is that we don't shoot anybody and doesn't disappoint what's alive.
When I was young, I made the pictures that saw at one collector at the wall together with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the images that people have finished.
Today, people's going to get sometimes.
They say: spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no consumption culture, it's a difference.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who live in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money because of the creation of images.
And I'm for such culture.
- Cyril, what's wrong in Peterburk?
- Nice officers for culture.
There is such a story: a worker over culture.
Not every one of them, but it can be a culture.
For the time of a series of cars, it wasn't all that, maybe the cars did not understand the cultures, but they realized that they needed to support real employees.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people who could be employees in the Petrobahad, but they are in somewhere in the cocktail, because they are needing great experts who are correctly evaluating these officers and lead them to the right way.
He's prospered today.
Dad Erart, but it is different that they say truely that we accept not all the modern science, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's after you Peterburk?
- Peterburk - it's not the main city of culture, in Moscow is more culture, there's the right bird.
And on our throne, the science is worthy.
We need culture, but we have more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
In Europe, there are very many people who are convinced who like to walk on the exhibition, concerts.
There's just a lot of layers with us.
We need the science to become moderately as it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is implemented by St.Peterburg
Rodit and Vesmery
The earth's in a worm.
Global opening or colize with a killed asteroid.
Cosmical cosmical cosmicals with the earthquakes on the road are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, how to maintain their family in unrestricted conditions or on the given replacement planet?
I think the choice is not big.
In fact, there are only two planets that are possible to develop, even if they were just hypothetic.
"It's Venuses and Mars," says the highly established scientific worker of the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg (SAISCH) Vladimir Surdin.
While Marso's better conditions for life, Venus has 500 Celsius temperatures on the top.
Living there only in a large higher or in the universe of Venuses.
In the world, the scientists started with a floor.
It's already half the century ago, the trials of growth were made.
Four generations of games developed on a sacrifice tree are nothing different from their land relatives.
Afterward, the smoke was carried out to the orbite - very small fruit muscles of Drosophile.
In 1979, the universe was sent to the entire branch sheep to check how the embryo is exposed in an insufficient state.
We get absolutely normal birds at the output.
But then the problems are starting.
"The problem is that this bird has to find an opposition, must be set on its own feet and start moved," says the Laboratory of the Biomedician Institute (IMP) RAN Vladimir Sič.
If they don't find the ground, the birds fall chaotically and make cooking.
After 10 hours, the amount of eggs were raised to a simple instinct.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And it was hard that they just died for four days.
"Twice we left the birds, but then we refused it, because it's just impossible to work with them," comments the mistake of experiments in the universe Vladimir Sič.
The last "miniarcha" animals flyed on a victim travel 16 years ago.
At July 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but they'll be only one head.
He had an experiment with pokens who were sent to the universe already gravity.
In fact, they didn't find anything overborn there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - it's about a unique experiment and such trials must be done," says Vladimir Sichev.
After accessing to the land, the fields were born by seeds.
However, the approach to the problem of increase directly in the universe has not yet been achieved.
It's a hard job.
Lifes in the loss of the common environment cannot just realize their heading instinct.
A man, on a difference from animals, can be in principle.
Human satans will dominate abstract thoughts and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiences do not implement.
But women fly in the universe 50 years ago.
The biggest dangerous Tyreshkov's worse.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chiaca has gone, and nobody could say if he's going to get years to the universe.
Can he be able to born a child after this year?
"Because no one has yet answered to this question," says the veteran of the race-beaches of Vachtang Vachnizes.
In June 1964, more than a year after a plane to the universe, she born the first woman-cosmonautka Valentina Tyreshkov's daughter.
My father was also a cosmonaut of Andrian Nikolaiev.
In 1988, the second son of a woman-cosmonautce Saturday, who visited the orbit twice and worked in the open universe.
However, the risk remains.
We have just a few little cosmonates who have been born long years and have grown healthy descendants.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous in orbital years," says Cosmonaut-Pilot, the Soviet Heart and the Lord of Russian Valerij Poljakov.
However, the humanitarian needs to search for new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection and creation of artistic gravitation.
The CPK Hydro laboratory is an obligatory step for air.
Here, in terms of zero accessibility, cosmonates develop the need to work in the open universe.
The water's like the state of the weakness.
The need for adults is water to be agreed, but in its way, in its way, for small children, it is natural.
Small leaders seem to be confirmed that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a conscience between the child is in the middle of nine months in the mother of fruit water and then it is easier to apply to them on water.
The principle is logical because from the time of birth, from the time of the first purchase, only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget the child something," says the instructor of the planning of Marina Aksenov's new birthdays.
Increasingly said - if it's a new-born child's status is unnatural, then for women is the most natural gravity, a attachable strength.
In the situation, it is very quick to be baptized in the grounds of branches, the swallows, the capacity of the body to sprinkle fruit.
We can leave this side if they will function the stimulators of favourite actions.
End of the end, it is possible that the birth is in a special comor in which the mother's organization brings fruit.
"What else?", says Valerij Poljakov's basic questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs a lovely gravity.
If the organism does not apply to the country's accessibility, it will not be able to make the right form of the hair or the equipment.
Novorozation on the offering train is not possible as a adult in a special clothing, in which he could tremble.
It's just gonna be rescued of what it needs for its development immediately.
"If we go with you to a experiment that allows the child to be born in the foreign environment, we will bring a healthy person who will not be approved to the outstanding environment," predicts the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Commission.
So the solution of children in the universe is just a theoretical question today.
However, there will be a time when reality becomes, and the earthquakes will be raised in their corabees on a far planet, which will be the house of their descendants in the universe.
Boss NKU: Swedish control failed to commit policies
The market is in accordance with the public laws of good controllers and quality legislation, but in its application.
In the conversation for currently. This says Vice-President of the Highest Control Authority of Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correctly his application - it is what is wrong with us according to my opinion," comments the current situation of Kala.
The same conclusion also indicates the common control of the Chess and German controllers.
For example, the wrong practice introduces access to Peter Nevertheless to the "sharkness".
Recently, Mr. Premier said that ODS doesn't have an officer to handle his controls - is then disabled or allowed?
"The law must be established, however, and if it declares anything, the President of the Government can't deny the office that has the obligation to control and exceed the obligation," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Government Committee in the Poland, you have discussed a common project between the German and the German, in the context of which the legislation related to public laws in both countries has been compared.
What's going on specifically?
It's about the parallel control we've started about two years ago.
Only it is said that the European legislation provides the way public laws to resolve, the following is individuals of national legislation and then the same practice.
We have given all these things together, and even when the control is not yet finished, we have shown very interesting differences - generally said the legislation is likely to be "extreme and perfecter", but the same practice is in some options better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create further and further more sufficient rules, but it is necessary to take place on the same application of the right.
What can this project really help you to help what of it is for you?
Such common controls would be able to help us to interfere with efforts to exceed laws, reduction and fulfillment of limits if there is no positive impact.
Economic means to obtain the corresponding thing for understanding (but not always below) price to exclude pollution and accidentally criminal action.
But if we reduce the limits of the law, we don't need to get it.
Perhaps this system will lose such a "papier" quantity that those who want to look for the fields in that system will be cutting a lot of simply than if the limit remains higher.
You are talking about the problems of Tuland with the translation of legislations relating to public laws to practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office like our NKU here, or is it set differently?
What's going on with the Offices, as the NKU works there in the Bundesregungshof, which is organized like us, and also has college, are only a little different way, but in the basis of both authorities are in the basis of the two offices.
Also, the authorities are in a certain way, however, that Germany has society coordination, so these accounts are also at the level of individual society countries - in this system is a little different from our system.
BRH can only control social money with us by the national media.
The public centres that are directed by countries and externals are controlled from the level of social accounts.
What's the mystery of legislation, so it's easier than ours?
In fact, I would not like this without specific data, but in some views, Germany is marked as a model, but it cannot be sure to say that it is better in all.
So it's necessary to have better controllers?
I'm sure it's not, but I'm saying again, I don't like such a comparison.
But it is necessary to say that the countries that we think are a model are involved with the whole number of problems.
Otherwise, it would not have been an offer for them to cooperate with our office, isn't it?
What about the Turkish legislation, which has marked the law of public laws for your office, has already appeared?
With regard to that the period of validity of this note is increasingly short, so it is still not shown in control actions.
Because we're doing ex post controls, it's necessary to count a certain expectation.
We observe it only in the preparation of future controls - we started our new tool "detection risk of economy" through which we have proceeded at least 14 thousand public laws, and analysed them - there will be the changes clearly shown because the limits, the conditions of certain types of election management will be edited and similar.
So, do you think that this law is often property, or any further abusion of the burocrate system?
I think this law is certainly a step to the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can guess that it's the rules of "conscious" and it's not possible to keep them.
For the implementation of previous rules, persons are already controlled by the provider (e.g. regional operating programmes of the Regional Council) to that each disadvantage of the law on public laws of the budget is essential.
So, do you have the price of the law in this way to condemn?
I don't think so.
The system needs to expose those who want to impress him and disappoint him, and not to keep those who are allowing a formal doubt that does not have effect on decisions.
This system will only create a bigger pressure on the burmcracy.
And what about that?
Let's show where the way's not going.
Recently, Mr. Premier said that the ODS won't be able to handle the control of that "sharks" - and what does that mean?
Is the scarcist disabled or allowed?
However, the law must be established, and if it declares something, the Government's President can not deny the office's activity that has to go to control and exceed the obligation.
He can say, "We'll change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're doing anything.
In the law on public laws, the rules are directly appropriate as to be made formally - which is right to protect the public cohesion.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when interesting with the best offer is excluded only for formal disagreements.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correctly his application - it's what's wrong with us according to my opinion.
The streets are pitchers, most, but food
In several places of the Republic of the Republic, the walls of the woods are also encountered.
Most of them are food cars, sometimes higher care.
Carlovar country
In the Carlovar country, the streets have been dinner, but the places, and also beaten.
The temperature is between five to ten grades under zero, but it's going to be lowly opened.
The destruction in the region has been established and in the neighbors is only low levels.
However, on the mountains of the Green Mountains is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The locations were also lower visibility because of the weakness, exposed from the data of the available national engineers.
The R6 rapid routes and the communications of the first class are now in the region without limits.
However, the attention is in the place, for example, in some movements, where the plane can be smooth and smooth.
It's also all the ways of the other and third class, including the mountain streets.
But in some areas, the rest of the dead and the places of the snow is still living.
In particular, in high places, it is necessary to carry up a higher attention.
Pardubic and King-Hardadian country
On some ports in the East Chess are worried, in high places and mountains can be on the communicating level of snow, he reports on its pages of the Government of More and Downtown.
The carriers warn the leaders before the ship, especially in the high places of the Pardubai country.
The Nalade can be around Lanšcrouna, the Court of Orlice, Politicals, Sviva or the High Mita, and it is particularly on the other and third classs.
Chemicals are covered by the I/43 and I/34 streets in Svitav.
The snow is particularly on the powers in the Krkonois and the Orlick mountains.
The dream plane is in the highest places on the streets in the period of Richnov over the priest and Trutnov.
In the East Chess today, it is the most clearest to the ground without a smoking.
The temperatures are usually moved between negative three and plus one grade Celsia, a low wind.
Plenary country
The streets in the Plzeni country are coming tomorrow, but places with higher care and vehicles are needed to apply the time.
That's after the morning, the temperatures are moved between three to nine grades under the smoke.
After the past of destruction and the following approval, there may be some communications in the fields.
The locations have to calculate the drivers, and the visibility will be easily improved.
It is described from the information available for national engineers.
The D5 Down is almost unlimited, however, a higher attention recommends the communication manager between 80 to 131 kilometers.
Most of the motors of the first class have the plane of smooth and smooth.
On the southern Plzeňsk and Tachovsk, but they can be a stripper.
The communicators of the second and third class are low, and in this case, they shall also apply advertising on the tissues.
The directors should be mainly careful on the less frequency paths in the area of Suma.
Olympic country
With the dream box on the street, we need to count the leaders to the highest place of the Olhoma country.
After chemical disposal, she remained on the Black Hor sitting and on the road on the Videlian Cross.
The carriers in the territory were exposed in the night of slaughter, on the Sumpers, according to the managers of the road, had a range of three centimeters.
In other parts, the vehicles are most driving without limit.
"In Sumpersca, there's a lot of rest of the snow.
With the dream box on the Red Hor seat, the drivers have to count in the direction of Jesennik," said the CTK discharger of the Sumper Management.
In the territory in the night, their colleagues in Jesenic, the ways to the highest places are now according to them after chemical explosion of holes and mockers.
In Olomouck, the streets are unlimited, however, at the Steernbersca, the leaders should be watched in the woods, where the cars remained low.
East country, Liberal country
In the morning, some of the hardly coming places are noticed today on the north of the Czech.
Except some locations with the dream or the lead is closed and the horse streets from Telnice at the Knick at Osteck, which are exposed from the police database.
The temperatures are also in the low grounds under zero, so the rain and the sky are obviously achieved.In the neighbors, especially southwest from the Czech Centre, there are no problems and the streets are smooth.
Executive complications are not yet listed.
The shipment of the aircraft reports the engineers, especially from the road of the East.
According to the meteorologists for her, the ideal conditions were in the night - over the day of rain and the cloud, in the night clear and dark.
From the main taxes, the conditions are also mentioned on the I/13 street at the border of the East and Liberal country.
The weather from Telnice on the Knicks was used to be broken by the rain trees that were burned under the snow to the car.
Simon Ornest: On the concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think he's got to end the end of the world for a entire month?
It's just one of the other famous reports we're likeing people.
As along with the Cape The Tap Tap Tap, we're just playing, and we say we're the only head of the world that can gather the enough positive energy to depart from the end of the world or defeat him.
In the prosince, you will also organise a project that is just a single three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to readers?
It's about the entire beneficiary action we're planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential for the end of the May calendar reported on 21 December at 11:10 later.
The day before December 20, from 21 hours, 3 concerts in Prace, Brna and Ostrava are consistently concerted.
They'll end the cold during the time when the Kiribati Island in Tichomar, which is in the time area for 12 hours before us, ends the May calendar.
Who came with this idea?
It was originally my idea, and we were all thinking together with our expert Honzo August.
In addition to that we want to join the enough positive energy and defend the end of the world, we also want to think about what situation this world will bring to our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we also created a unique collection of bottoms, tricks, tickets or original keys against the end of the world I'll buy on www.e-tap.c.
The Tap Tap Tep, together with other interprets, also singed a thus called hymn against the end of the world, named "The end of the world has been cancelled."
It's a very favorite YouTube today, also on these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it's in the complete end, so if everything's going to do, and the end of the world will not be able to...
They sing it all interprets on all three concerts together.
Hymny also offers a unique direct transport to the Czech TV.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the cycle plays Tomas Hanak, singing in it also Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural scene, with regard to the order of a lot of beneficial actions and concerts...
We're trying to introduce them intensely in these projects.
It appeared that most of them are interesting and bathrooms with us.
What's going on from the concerts against the end of the world?
In the absence of the unbarrier education center of Studeo, which has been conducted in the sixth year with the citizenship of Tap in the Jedi.
For students of Jedi's school, the doctors are regularly employed in activities that are bath and interesting.
Samoother students have no means to deliver themselves to the doctors, so we are trying to allow them this way.
In the framework of the Treaty in the future, a single building to which we move with this project.
On each concert, several music groups and interprets.
Why did you choose them?
We've tried to meet a program that calls all generations including children.
For example, in Praia, China's ships, Lesbians support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jire Search.
All details are visited at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some similar "bombast actions" and to the future?
In May, we will first go to Prash Year, so we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting hosts.
In the next year, we would like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, I would like to connect it to Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimistic, you have already gone out in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is only a group that creates individuals.
How do you control these paths logically and organized?
It's not so terrible as it looks like the first look.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, their vehicles must travel in a weak space, and we will, of course, pluck a large quantity of costs and bottoms with tools...
However, it has always been done without problems, the CSA and the British Airways have been greatly prepared for us that I've been divorced for many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
Thanks to the exits to the border, you can compare individual differences in unbarriedness, public access to indicated and similar.
What did you still met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better with us, we just were witnesses in Russia that it's still in the entire beginnings.
Opti Praze is a very barrier Moscow, here is still innormal to move a man on the electric car himself in the center of the city.
They don't pay the same self-consciousness there, as the vehicle needs you to give a privilege in the expenditure.
Fortunately, there is already a civil society that is trying to advise people’s problems.
And in what other ways do we still have to achieve the growing country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to say that performance and improvement of the situation is always involved in the opportunity of people who are concerned about it.
In London and in Madrid, it is totally normal that people with hard endictions are just moved to public, they can go to the toalet, to the museum, whereever...
But it's not too common that there would be a large number of people with the active participation of the society life, in which we're even a little before the Tap Tap!
The respect of public or unbelievableness is one thing, but at the moment when we will be significant sportives, artists, brains, politics, or lawyers, then things will begin to change reality.
It's still the unique cases of people who have strong will.
Capel The Tap Tap is in the present very popular, but let's go back for a few years back, what has you committed to put it in 1998?
I came as a guaranteer in Jedchenca, where I had a lot of young people who had something to do.
And as I'm a musician, I'm playing another saxofon, so I've found a special music crawl together with a college.
Well, in time, we're talking about what our moderator says, Lady Angelovič, a little shocked out of the hands.
But the population came to the last years, or I'm wrong?
It's true that it helped us when we started to connect with the known songs and also work actively for the propagation of the capels.
We've done that the work that doesn't see is basically like it doesn't exist.
We can also allow quality medicines, equipment, and further.
Was your goal to get it with the Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt potential to do something else.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one seems another.
It's his logical way, all news are taken carefully and remains long.
The livings that are united are very little, but I'm going to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first deal with a person who first sees us is of course sorry, it's natural...
But this forgiveness is just enough, because people with an enigma are not a suffering of all lost lives we need to loud.
They are people who can live a full life and develop themselves, of course, for the proposal that they have needed means.
I'm saying that when something is able to make people with the gendike, it's not just for them, but for the whole company.
Have this success also helped you to be a big boss, how many people have mentioned you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be in many things incompatible and require a certain disciple.
But I think it's just normal.
Some people are coming to us with romantic imagination and heads in clouds, and when they find that you need to go two weeks to try, get on the preparation and travel a lot of time on the concert paths, so it's quickly to leave.
But this works all around, in every group that wants to work, and who wants to get something.
The Tap Tap has now twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only the only Lady Angelovič.
We're open groups, people go and come, it's not gonna be defeated.
Whoever has the will and the rich, has always the door open with us.
The day of experiencing before the end of the world, on February 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Travel in Praze Incheba Arena, Brna Fléda and Ostra Plynoye for participation of 12 chapters and other musicians from the Republic of the Czech Republic
All three cities are in the end of the evening offers telesm in a single song of the Tap Tap Tap 'The end of the world has been cancelled.'
The objective of the concert is to collect financial instruments for the development of the multi-barrier education center of STUDEO at a single establishment in Praia in a total of 25 million Kč
Incoming to the concert is 400 Kč, children to 12 years have severe income in the pre-production of Bohemiaticket
Poland and cosmos.
In the past week, the European Cosmic Agency was adopted as a twenty-seventh member of this European Cosmic Agency, as a second country from the East East Blog (see the ESA member of 12 November 2008).
Spain started a lot of cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the next year, a number of projects of the Agency was participated.
Of course, the path of Poland has started a lot of years ago.
The aircrafts in the cosm were able to have the Poland overseers already before the Second World War, but they did not always meet the understanding.
Remember, for example, the preview of A. Sternfeld in Varshav Astronomical observators, which represented thoughts of his physophonic work Income to the cosmonacity.
The thoughts of the young engineer (nur 1905) left the boyfriends and after years, Steernfeld reminded that only Dr. John Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld in 1934 received the income to the cosmonautics in France the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirscha.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonautics.
In the Poland magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books of those scientists.
Gadomski became the world's known propagator of cosmonautics, and his reward was evaluated as well as one of the shorts on the turned side of the Moon was named by his name.
In 1925, the next tree was established in Poland, which had to be reserved by the racket engine.
The famous author of the proposal is not known and they are not known nor the details of the project.
It is not clear if the racket should be used for the tree disease or for her smoking.
The information about this tree is known only from a good pressure.
Since 1933, the racket shoes began to build a Poland stroke.
Research was ensuring the Challenge of Army Technics in collaboration with Professor Sword Wolfkem and Professor Gusta Mokrzyckiegim.
From the materials contained, it is obvious that the research has increased practical tests.
Of course, the German army's coming was interrupted by the investigation.
In 1937, in an extra pressure, it was found a proposal of photo-electric smoking rackets that proposed the Rorazin Ingegner and in the next year, Rakieta went out the work of the airtorped and the rakietobomba aeroplane of Leliwy-Cryblock.
Both projects were defined for military use of racket engines.
Instead of war with all the projects of military use of racket techniques, the Middle Scientific Advisory Committee (Timming Advisory-Scientific Committee), which coordinated all work.
The Committee was based in 1937, but after the two years of his action, the war was finished.
Another work carried out after the war in the Poland Press shows thanks to the work of the Poland Astronautical Society (Poland Astronautical Society).
First is the note of the company in November 1954 of the 1954 Report of Problems, in which four of the astronautical articles are carried out.
In one of them, from Professor M. Subotvicz, is proposed to create a company that will be occupied by cosmonatic.
In that time, projects of artistic types have already been developed, and it was clear that space research was a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, Poland astronautical company (PTA) tried to enter the International Astronautical Federation (based in 1951) and the PTA has already been a serious member.
And in the next year, the first president of PTA Kaziheim Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) was the Chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
This function remained until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA was significantly participated in the development of very successful meteorological RM rackets (Meteorological Rackets), which became the first Poland Rakett, which had conducted scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was finished in 1957 and at the first start of 10 October 1958.
Rakett with access to 1800 meters was a lot of about 80 cm, and its quantity was increasing 5 kg.
Later, the perfect version of RM-1A was established and in 1959 was started in the Bledov wilderness of the Aeroplane RM-2 rackets.
Raketta was a long time of 1,4 meters, and its weight was almost 11,5 kg.
Another development type had already been capable of real scientific work - RM-34 racket had to have access to 14,5 km and its task was the monitoring of high wind.
In particular, in 1962, further development was stopped.
The follower of the first RM type was raised by the Meteor-1 racket in 1962 to 1965.
Raketta was conceived as a double, her total length was 510 cm and the starting temperature was 32,5 kg.
Three types were issued (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were limited to the size of space for scientific devices.
Meteor-1A rate was available for 0,4 litres, meteor-1B object 0,34 litre and meteor-1C for object 0,62 litre.
Maximum access to all three types was 37 km.
In 1965 and 1968, the Aerial Institute of Development of Metaor-2, which the first aviation tests started in January 1970.
Raketa Meteor-2 had 380 kg initiated and was able to provide a useful rate of 10 kg up to about 60 km.
The Weather-2H and Meteor-3 were launched recently.
In 1960, the Commission for Space Research has to be remarked in Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR for two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, the Italian pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was in 1978 after Vladimir Remko's second intercosmonaute.
The interruption of the law on public works is not a solution.
In the past week, he interrupted the fundamental court of public works.
The excuse was called to publicly live discussion.
It will be sure that it will be interested in looking at the issue of a larger view.
Liberally orientated economic systems in the EU as in the globalised world are based on more, non-regulated economic competition.
In its effect, it means that individual economic disasters, national economic systems, stand in permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free, no unlimited movement of the private capital together with an independent financial specialization.
The impact of the significant differences of the price of the work, (minder), is to the price rate.
In this regard, it is necessary to understand the state when the manufacturer is trying to be imported by the import of the left goods in the economic concurrency with the "committing" price of the competitor with the purpose of exploiting a greater part on the market and to increase its own cycles.
In the massive measure, it means for the majority of businessers to translate the production to the foreign, or to buy it easily, or disappear.The result is high independence in countries where the prices of work are compared to other high economys.
Since the private capital has no Community responsibility and the responsibility for its production of unemployment, it is necessary to increase social costs of the State.
The whole situation allows non-governmental officers to pay the data and to replace the economic and social entire accidents that have been drinking in the honey.
The situation is, however, known that it is not necessary to introduce specific statistical data.
The independent practices of the private capital are established in individual economic situations when the governments of individual countries are urgent to enter into a separate cohesion with the purpose of reducing the social level of their own population with the purpose of accessing to the foreign capital country.
Otherwise, governments give the private capital to all own citizens without regarding social accidents.
This is particularly shown in the changes of valid laws.
The goal is economically to take the own citizens to take the price detail of the private capital, especially in the area of the border.
However, this happens in the case of long-term unemployment, but the limitation of the rights of employees in the field of work law.
The result is the growth of poverty together with the growth of difference between the poor and the rich.
In SRN there are already a number of years of public foods for poor people who cannot benefit their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In the context of the increased competition capacity of German economy, it is usually common to the cases that the workshops are directly achieved that they should be paid to the minimum existing.
This scandal was published also in the case of assistance employees of the society dream.
The useful measures practically all the southern States of the EU are increasingly guided to the same situation when people are under the pressure of the catastrophical fall of social levels to emigrate as it was in 19th century, or animals for hungry rods of society in hope that a private investment capital may be along to the country.
You need to ask where it comes?
If this is from other EU countries, then the poverty from one country is moved to another, or does not come anyway, for China, India, Brazil, Turkish, Marokkaan, or Egypt, or African still works for the European Mediterranean.
That's about all Latin America.
The liberal theory and media to be limited says that the state cannot be able to participate capitally in its own economy that the economy is leading to economic katastrophy.
The Private Capital of the Sweden continues to advise that the State may not include the rules of guidelines to the economy.
Afterward, it is necessary to ask whether the private capital does not affect, currently rules the policy and the whole state in its own egoistic meaning.
There's a unique answer that's right.
In fact, there is practically all powerful existence and in all States all the entire lobbys.
The result is a fair situation in the corruption area, providing the costs of each other, laws, where practically all the criminals are, but nothing is punished.
In SRN the situation is that the State Ministry for Financial Federation provides the implementation of the proposals of laws to private legal companies agreed with the industry.
These proposals of the law are then conferred in Bundestage.
The whole power does not come from the people as western types are reported, but from financially strong groups of prefering own interests.
Obviously, liberally orientated democracy is now achieved quickly, as Appianos describes it in his work of the Crisis of Roman Republic for the time of Ceesara and Pompeia: "The state was already long in the full distribution and the authorities had been forced.
For tables, unlawful achievement and using stones or swords.
The subplantation and corruption fell without any challenge, and the people went to choice with the vote before selling," ..."Caliters of the office didn't just go out, so he was once in the consequence of this divorce was a state of eight months without consolidation." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The current company is based on an independent preference of its own benefit without regarding the entire interest.
The private capital is not able to understand and apply the entire efforts.
The result is now, as well as at the time, an unexpectable decade of elit without any effort to reform the deep race.
We should therefore look forward to the use of fascist and communist systems in the non-compatible liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th century.
In the present situation, the record of these systems can be considered as a certain interruption with expecting another round.
Especially catastrophe is the fact that the present elections are totally ignored in the future the potential statistical losses of life, humanitarian and social katastrophes that we are now witnesses to crimes against humanity, as we know of old and new cases.
The interruption of the law on public works is not a solution, at least not permanent.
The Government of the Republic of the Czech Republic will continue to search for ways as to reduce social levels.
This trend is systemic.
The solutions are targeted by political and social reforms that send a capital participation of the State in the economic, enhance the influence of citizens on government and enhance the position of the private capital in the company in the efforts of the State.
Israel: The Laboratory of Caos.
"Nothing will happen from violence and never can't" Sting in Fragile's song with her main verse in the reflection is "Not forget how we're cross."
"If my sons don't want war, there would be no one" died Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayera Amschela Rothschilda in 1849
After the last full of violence between Israel and Gaza, many reactions have been made as always.
One of them stand after Israel, arguments his right to themselves and Palestinian to the role of terrorists, others support Palestinian, arguments the rasis of the Israeli State, genocide to the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel passes to the role of the terrorism.
I don't want to think about who is periodically reacting to the killing of a victory and whose victims, the ends of the people of Israel today, including the samo right fields, have been born in the current political situation and the beginning of violence.
I'm going to offer the readers a view for the defense, the view of the one who serves in particular 95 years remaining injury (recommended from Balfour Declaration in November 1917) at a small coast of the Middle East country.
Some of my opinions are supported by available historical facts, some of them are declined on the basis of my own understanding of the person whose group is the main hybate of the events of modern history.
The story of mankind is in the first sort of story of power.
In every episode, we can look at some of the great Alexandra or Napoleon.
What is not so appropriate if it was always those persons that directed automatically their steps and whether there were a person who put their actions to the objective of the exclusive purpose.
We have to allow us to live in time when the world's riches are concentrated in the hands of several units and that to this concentration of money and that the power that is exposed could not get to life for one generation.
In the middle of these astronomically rich families, it is one that could be considered to be the head of the cooking (I don't know anybody yet, but I don't interpret it) - Rothschields.
He doesn't write a lot about them.
Perfectly.
The First Press Agency (Reuters) was already buyed in the 19th century to stop their names with high criminal effects in which they stayed in the background, and they had always marked power, richness or both for them.
They have the main parts in at least all the central banks of the world and against the country where they don't take or prepare wars (for the attack of Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after Iraq attacked, it was five countries, after Kaddafia's office was only four, but between Russia, the Central Bank of the Russian Government.)
Whoever tried to raise this family, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank of Rothschielda Bank of America, started in the process of civil war to give their own (the government understanding) money and was murdered in 1865 in the divade.
JFK began to pay his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, was murdered 1963, an elder Louis Mc Fadden was lost in 1936 after he wanted to invite FED to devote a large economic crisis in 1929.
Their touha by global power led in 1859 - 1871 to formulate the plan of three world wars to the most highest, 33th of the light of Albert Pikem.
The first war had to be taken to remove the large monarchist state entire in Europe, the second should remove the Colonial Government, especially the Great Britain, and the third has to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 to 1 billion people (the number of slaves for their agreement and Luxus stays and does not need so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecuménism is nothing other than the preliminary for such resolution) and the final translation of absolute power.
The method that the most rich family group of Rothschieldy works is the choice of crisis and the following solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are but false and always lead to disappointment of the situation (see FED's enhancement to not repair the crisis as the chosen in 1907).
So after the murder of the Hassbury followers of the R-U Throne Ferdinand in Sarajev, they destroyed the Caribbean Russian Russo's execution of the Bolivia Revolution.
The first world war has finished the surface, military and economicly unrestless, German capital (which has not needed wars to destroy the Russian Carbour), and, afterward, it has come to discharge the central European power, Ukraine.
In order to easily disappear the second world war, bankers have left the political policy to create a strictly conflict situation in which the Germany has established a large war repair, which has created the prevention of radicalization of the weighted mass, and then is enough to support Germany enough powerful, vineyards that indicate and single solutions of the Leader offered, and also create a multinational Czech Republic with a smaller Germany, which had been very, very, very, very, very functional, colonels.
In the end of the 19th century, Rothschiel's construction of the Cynthistical Aggregation, which one witched on the creation of the Jewish State, especially in the history of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the main city (return to Zion).
Balfouro’s declaration has already established a proposal for the massive immigration of the Jews in Palestinian, the first pillars with the local Arab citizens.
The terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The second world war was exhausted if Hitler had lost a string on which the international bankers had maintained him, or everything he had done in the plan was hard to deal with it, every suffering of the European Jews in the concentrations had made a proposal for accepting the Jewish State of the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and as the German military repairs had been made at the Second World War, the state of Israel was created by the fire of the third war.
If the international bankers are able to destroy it, the Jewish nation will be like in the second, victims in the first line of battle, now together with Arabic or general Muslim Population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a serious laboratory, the source of the brain and the chaos, not only in the field of the land, but also in the international measure (we take only as a spectacle shares the people on the prostitution and the refuge of Israel).
Who is the victory and who sacrifices in Palestinian - the Israeli conflict, where the crumbling plants the crumbling in the unexpected string of violence, when at the beginning of all, the chambitability of individuals and their rate by global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simply residents of Israel from their leaders, because such as we are, the international bankers support people to choose in the choices of their own candidates.
The current president of Israel is a typical example of a fashioning, to international loyal bankers, policy, which makes everything to explore the war with Iran, which, in view of the Iran member of the Shanghai organization for cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), has grown up in global conflict and in respect of Iran over the Hormust Prime, which has passed 20% in the world-wide (the rope is only 2 miles) and the destruction of the world economys.
In which light now there are words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is global crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world row in their presence is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the residence of human population serves a degree of financial aristocracy.
The world where each new birth is implanted at the birth of chip, which makes a total controlled lives.
"And put all small and great, rich, and poor, free, and slaves to have on the right hand or on the road of the ceils, so that he can't buy nor sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of his name.
It's necessary to understand who's understanding to calculate the numbers of the animals.
This number marks a person and it's the number of 660."
Argo movie: When it's the least, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he contained the advantages of Islamist students of the American Ambassade in Teheran and buyed 52 diplomates as handmaids.
They were allowed to be exchanged as a high-shirt chair of Mohamed Rezu Pahlavy, who was in the United States after revolution, who was the patron of his mode after a few decades.
For American administrative situation, there was not a positive east - hot ship over the board, because it would be so important to be confident in other countries.
But in Iran, where the revolution had been raised in the teokratic mode, it was not able to achieve.
It was the morning for the Press of the United States, which later spread the failure of trying to release the hands with power.
The prisons of diplomates were finally released after 444 days after the exhibition of the Algerian Government.
Their deal has called the field of solidarity and the contrarian feelings.
Debacol in Iran was explicitly attached to Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in 1980 President's choices.
The film of the hero Bena Afflecka Argo describes one episode of the history that American has brought a detailed victory.
Besides the embassy of her, six employees were excited.
After the entire peripedias, the Canadian assembly was finished.
In cooperation with Canadian authorities, the CIA had made them to get from Iran, however, helped extravagant story story - they went to Canadian passengers as a member of a movie ship that looked on the location for the storage of science-fi grandcofilm in the country.
Accommodation
The plan that made an expert on the "exfiltration" to Tony Mendez, requested also Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be faithful, the film project was written in specialised magazines, the print conference was organized, the effective production company had a real office.
The details of the operations were long-termly expired, the movie goes out of Tony Mendez's reminder.
Afflecko's film is a special combination of more employees.
On one side, a political thriller, such as "caper movie", a story of the box, an exemplary - can be a series of Danny's partners.
In the movie, there are also grounds - on one side documentary sequence from Teheran (in the title sequences are shown icons of the events and ways that the same situations were introduced in the film - big differences are not available).
On the other hand, a passy from Hollywood, along with irony and a peaceful surprise.
And then there's another scene from the CIA and other officers in clothes are exploring situations at one tables, on office travels, in the phone...
Ben's Affleck's aware way he's restarting carriers.
With the expression of the brain, it became the respected register, and his heritage has stopped beyond the ironical notes.
Argo is his third worldwide film, after the dark crimes Gone Baby Gone (2007) and thriller City (2010).
Also, it's the first dream of Afflecko, which doesn't be raised in the register of Boston's house.
The citizen for the atmosphere of the location was also included between characteristics that the registration of old films increased the Hollywood standard.
Affleck shows him in Argu where Teheran's "game" Canada.
The best scene in the movie are explored in the streets, when rebuilding real events - the executive sequence of an ambassadee is active in their faces, which also focuses on emotions and unprecedency, which rises when some of them are cleaned.
The similar effect of Affleck and his cooperators are in the mental scenes (false steel on the teheran bazar).
Too many storys in too many places
The rhesis had to also agree with that the story was not really powerful in the meaning of the films of the scenes.
It works very successfully with this, sometimes something really thinks - there is nothing so elegantely gone (the scene in which the horrible crisis on the Teheran air is returning the phone in America and the honey after the ranch is attached to the hairs).
Slabin's Arga, but it's the disaster of the need to show too many storys on too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the role of Hollywood cooperators even very sharantic, but their positions would serve more space and they are not only in this film.
Afflekko's film so little loss dramatic tattoo, it's a dream which is able to monitor with a peaceful interest, assess the realization and back style that enhance thrillers 70.
But it's just hard.
As an advertising of a certain way of life history and evidence of how the representations of all powerful and knowledge of secret services are replaced but set up.
Rules for infringement of ballons, bans and circles
The server www.bankovnipoplattky.com, which quotes an annual anket on the most sustainable bank payment, has now decided to report the consent of the "the most abhorred Regulation or ideas of the EU party".
"It has brought us to the last event when the EU plans to accept 40 per cent quote for women in the leading of large European firms," said the Procedure's Anket organizator Patrik Naer.
For example, among the named absurds is the recent decision of the European Court on the development of a satellite for men and women.
There were also women in the prices of life insurance, because they are objectively less risks.
"There incredible ideas of the EU party can be called people to the end of the air year.
The same vote will be fulfilled to the end of February 2013," announced Naser.
In the middle of the EU Contracting Regulation, the biocarbons are also required to reduce the biocarbons to the thick products, which, consequently, the nature's disease, continues to use the use of combined steel temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances or the Directive on the size of smokes, which has been explicitly healthed by the vineyard.
The crisis has also rejected the fact that the use of the expression of an anointed mass or the exhibition of classic requirements from the sale.
Quality bans have 14 centimeters
The exploitation camera often decides under the pressure of the trade or industry lobby which often requirements in Brussels to take a certain State or a group of States (as the Chess now and the severe vetus is required by their bank requirements).
Let's take the lobbys still because, for example, the most highest quality banks had to achieve the length of at least 14 cm and should not be shown "anonymous claims".
However, the European Commission was therefore encouraging that only harmonizes the adequate national standards that have complied with trade.
The EU's standards relating to fruits and green fruits have already been able to ensure that existing Directives are guided to consume foods.
The candidate for winning in anket may also be the EU rural Regulation, in accordance with the sales of infucture ballons, should be noted that children are younger than 8 years should not be infused without the observance of adults.
The EU has been called here to American research, in accordance with the ballons between the players, leaderly caused to death children to suffer.
The same limits are now paid for children to 14 years when footing in the woods.
Curious ideas are born and home
It is therefore appropriately absurd that the rules relating to the own European Officers - everyone who has some official functions in the EU can not be able to use the Greek name of Macedonian and must speak in place of the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Laissez Faire service of the Liberal Economies in cooperation was called in anket, including some above absurds, and the Union Regulation on the objective of food rules in the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum limits of food resources that could be found in the CRR territory on the day of our entry into the Union.
The ship was then exceeded, for example, established in concerted nuts, because he had a high temptation.
Anket organizators also took the idea of paying some countries because they have no sea, and the idea of paying a question for a question.
However, these ideas were not discovered in Brussels, but in Praia.
"We're happy because we don't have the sea.
We request the European Union to refund," reported the next Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CHSSD).
As a argument, we had been born a lot of burdens and, in consequence, intervention costs had to be fulfilled to export.
Because the Czech has continued to contribute, the EU had to pay for hundreds of million euros according to Palace.
The European Commission, finally, has gone out of the CRR in order to organize the tender for the purchase of towns from countries that have no access to sea.
The request to reach a question was offered by the Foreign Ministry for the Local Development of the Minister Paul German (US-DEU), particularly to apply requests from Brussels.
EU: Biomary Regulations are excluded
However, in the Member States, the provisions of the EU's regulation and the more effective functioning and the development of the whole Union are often served as a recognition.
The most important problem is, for example, the EU's demands on projects that have not marked anything common to the European integration, but the Member States have used in payment operations.
The emergency between the Czech reveals that, as well as other EU countries, the CRR should fight in Brussels on the right to specific indications of its traditional products, which will not always succeed in this case.
Even after the sixth battle with Germany and Rakushany, the margins of Olympics, however, the Tumarian rum that the tradition of us gains to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to be renamed to the tumor.
The name of rum can only take products from the tristan destilate, not from sugar rivers.
In the official list of products registered by the EU, the world-wide feta and gorgonzola society, the German Lübeck or the parmatic shops have already seen, for example, the carlovarian solar, the horn and the throat chlor and the cheatical cloud.
Protection of the EU's mark then can also glorify the pardubical perimeter and horrific trombs.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm a Amateur, Khamura.
Mr. Senator, how would a man think he wants to convince the president?
I don't think I'm a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without problems, I don't candidate anywhere.
But I can't see how the last twenty years of the country will be deceived how bad they run here, people increase the data and the age of department.
I didn't have to be political.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And as I had 40 years ago and I'm an independent disaster, I have no other opportunity to affect things than candying the senator or the president.
You got to the Senate, but you've got a shot on the Grad.
Don't you turn back to people who have chosen you?
All the time I said I'm going to fight about Grad according to the results of the senate choices.
Afterward, I convinced that if I was chosen by the senator, I'm going to convince the President.
My goal, but it's not function, the function is tool, as I can do my view.
That's why I need what's the biggest influence and what's the strongest mandate.
But it's not only that we're going to be in business and TV, but that we're sending everybody who wants to try to change.
It is added to the media that devote humans and that are freely lying with freedom.
I needed to say that I was a newspaper or I was a counsel of Jiri Paroubk.
Let's go to your vision.
At the battle of the Great, you have expressed the responsibilities of the policy and the returned majority of over twenty millions.
You have to change the law.
But as President, you don't have such authority and only the Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to resolve it?
When I lobbled as a citizen to be free of life, it was possible to proceed.
The problem is policy - when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or right, he refuses to deny, and the citizens keeps it.
As an independent disaster, I have a greater potential to receive support from all Parliaments parties.
My presence is that I can take something that is best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Are you thinking about a right man or a left?
From the Chess view, I think people's ordered me at least left.
It's not important for me if a little left or a little right.
It's important for me to go forward.
I don't care if someone is left or right, but I want people to join.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if the CSCHM or the ODS will make it, and I will also be against the bad thought.
You're reading when someone says you're a popular.
But you don't show what you said?
When you create a bunch in the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to close it.
Someone can call it people, but all the proposals I speak are already in the world, or they have talked about them.
But without support for Parliament, you'll have only passwords.
And you don't have a long-term policy with this.
Or do you think if you're going to follow people and talk to them that you will be able to prosecute, for example, a criminal and aware responsibility?
I have no other chance.
Provide policies, newspapers and publicity and try to get them on our side to ask them.
If I was chosen by the President, there is no problem to arrange the television direct transmission, where I request the President of Parliament's parties to ensure the sustainable and criminal responsibility for policies, officers, judges and State Defence.
And they'd have to share why they don't want her.
If there is a strong person who will be named non-shirts, you can click on the political scene.
Take the right choice of the President, it was a public pressure.
I'm saying I'm a Amateur that I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and views, I'm trying to look for a relationship.
I first started in the policy and I'm trying to get a major support for my programme.
I'm trying to save myself, but if it's not going, I'll end six years and go back to the private sector.
Sometimes it seems like Okamur should save the Chess.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I don't do anything in one person, so I'm taking a number of known people, if they wouldn't even be able to the Senate.
I went after Radim Janczur, who rejected a lot of jobs.
So, at least, I supported the research newspaper of Jan Lorenco, who discovered suits with a lot of high oil.
I candid that people are really worried, but now I'm on serious.
Seventeen percent of people have not gone to the choices and those who have gone, most of them have chosen the representative of the establishment.
We're just two independent in the Senate.
People have invited the Senate to make the changes difficult.
But I will fight for my vision, for example, by the right choice of officers or captains.
Would you like to make your own sides?
I didn't think about that, because I have no time to check out the age of every potential side, and I don't have money.
I don't have money nor on the president campaign. On my transparency account is only 20 thousand.
You don't have money?
You're talking about matematic advices, what's yours?
I'll take a privacy to 60 million.
In Prae, I have a location for 25 millions, live for ten millions, more than eight millions, a collection of artificial works about ten millions, Aston Martin for 3,5 million and the Superb Scope for millions and then I have a couple of millions on the account.
At Aston Martin, I've got because it was my club dream - I always liked James Bond, who led in the car, was a galant to women and also fighted against the evil and the disorders.
You're leaving Aston Martin, you've got $60 million and you don't have money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to give your own money to it.
It's not too convinced.
I don't have 15 million in the camp.
Is that what I need to do?
I've got 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, she witnesses that my program probably doesn't have such interest.
And I don't have to pay the campaign for my own.
The campaign payments are based on what I'll get to the senator pay.
But I couldn't pay to the son of the English school for 30 thousand months.
If I just wanted to buy money, I don't know.
So you're gonna continue business to live?
Didn't you say you're gonna fuck this activity?
But it doesn't correspond to the higher payment.
As I promised, my activities were partly smoking.
For example, my leader will be my leader.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much were you as a businessman to take a month?
Two hundreds to 400 thousand, I'll get back.
And if I'd be president, I would finish my business.
You'll find the whole conversation in the Saturday Exhibition of Right.
MVRDV architectures are evidence that real welfare is not only in the head - for example, Pyijkenisse and recently established Hora Book - 2 images
"This building seems happy, it seems to be futuristic, and finally it's again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the street border.
Stefan Spermon, the IT technology in the nearby big company, less, "It's a good house."
But I ask what we need today.
Everyone has Internet, iPads and electronic books.
Nobody goes to this book in an old style, right?
Disciplines, sisters in a close near Rotterdam without own job opportunities that are not available for visits, keeps special records.
This case with 800,000 citizens shows the less education in all the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this deeply situation, a few years ago, the decision has fallen to the global education and set seven beautiful minis of the efficient monkeys designed on the eurobanks.
Success of education of opiny, but it wasn't worthy.
So the citizens recognize that there is only the only possibility of the statistics: we need to have a book!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectonic Atelier of MVRDV, the master of the low-sharing column graphs and the master of funny, often, even even cynical structures, took something with normal calm and consistent treatment in 2003, with five books under the board and the smoke on the face.
And while the Commission still looked very exciting around himself and rolled the branches, the door of Maas raised his gifts on himself according to the size and his actively actively fulfilled the word "The beloved cities!"
So this is my proposal on Hora's book in Spikenise, such as Boekenberg!
Thirty years later, 30 million euros were raised.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parks, supermarket, mail and several accessible homes with 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, the Hora book was designed by the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also called for Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The white fasad, which could still not offer more than a postmoderous range and an increasingly smooth railway, for which you had almost expected a medicare, is more rich for a little judicial architecture.
First, but now it has the first public cultural state in his history.
A long path to the book
First rate: reader eldore under the cycle on the seed.
In the middle of the mountains, however, the real spaces and readers are shown up to the higher topography.
On all sides, the interference is light and transparent, the ground of the smoke and the elegante lying lights clearly express the atmosphere of the public threat.
The city environment is perfect.
You see park lakes, dogs and boys and girls who play football.
And the books, the books, the books.
"Normally standing rules with books under fasad and in the middle is a great dark space that is most inevitable and inevitable," says Winy Maas.
We set up a classic space setup up the feet, and the space for readers we went outside.
The Hory Book is shockly useful: in the middle of the officers, the Internet library, the shock club, the ecological centre and the middle home technology.
Specific joys are black police on books that are one shadow of the wall, a parapet, and one time the board of the fields.
The view, the structure and the structure of the alien.
On the unknown structure material, the heads are even packed with architecture and structure ingegners.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," says Joop Trouborst, leader of the project at the cities of Spikenisse, on a question of the standard magazine.
So, in a fresh agricultural business one day, we have raised a suitable academic product from agriculture.
For many years, it is used as a base under the radiation of milimeter rounds from synthetic climates.
It's easy and time-efficient.
The dark textil has one, two sezons, and then it's shooting in a weak disaster.
For the library, it was round - first in such a quantity - listed on the board about four centimeters.
The colors of the landscape (KLP) in dark, homogeneous and hard material, which will smooth a little as a new car and a little as a sport bottle.
After 105 feet, you'll get up on the top.
At the end of at least 500 meters of long steel, you will be rewarded not only by a fantastic view of the city, but also by the Netherlands steps and fictions in the floors.
They're looking for the atmosphere, but mostly about the right air depth in the high literature.
Dars for a new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is in the middle of many beautiful desktops, a proper project that is about the ecological," says Trouborst.
They'll get out of the earth's team.
Although the Hora Book stands under the cloud, the sun lights within a short time, and it also in the sun's days.
Large fat tree wood stealing tree stealing three to smooth fashion serves as smoking and maintaining a large part of the sun schedule.
The climate in the room is very happy.
The rest of the role is full of automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, the starting sceptic of the IT branch, has already visited a new book.
And Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Godarde, which also refers to Boekenberg as "for a long time expected soul" Spikenisse.
The reason: each citizen of the city was invited for a few weeks ago to open a book from his personal fund.
The first fulfilled optical spaces should be not yet completed by the book, which now reads 70 000 cups.
Concept was witnessed.
The police are completely filled.
"Nothing worse than a half empty book," says Winy Maas.
"I think our invitation now has a certain relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she'd just be on the ground.
The MVRDV has been attached to the king's discipline, which is in a famous jargon stated to identify.
The story of literature was written.
Let them be young and unbelievable.
That's the default point for identity.
"We have to play a greater role."
Germany has stopped voting when Palestinian's adoption decided.
According to the expert on relations between the United States and the European Stephan Saboa, Berlin is balanced on a large diplome.
Deutsche Welle: During the beginning of the week, Germany first signed that it would vote against the proposal on the Palestinian state of the United Nations.
But then Berlin stopped the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be for his special relationship with Israel.
But now I think it doesn't support American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence — however, it would not be too critical for Israel.
During the rise in Libya, in March 2011, Germany was also listed to the vote when he went to the discharge of non-legal zones.
You finally asked NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position in several international subjects?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it changes its front-term policy, and it is the direction of the policy that has been raised by the United States, directly to German front-term policy.
The situation is more difficult that the Europeans have no coherent and single policy.
So Germans are between two fronts.
He's expecting them to play the most independent role, but they're not normal.
I think they're in their role early, but they're on the way to the "normal" field policy.
To the foreign policy, which they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from German view?
It shows the preparation to take place in the case of national interests and positions that are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German frontal policy is motivated to the economic policy, so exporting and its relations with certain areas, both Russia, China, or close East.
The German economic interests are in a certain way other than economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany needs to protect their interests.
Have economic interests affected positions in the near conflict and voting in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large residence at the nearest east, especially in the States around the Persian Agreement.
Therefore, it must be careful to not be afraid of publicity, but not the elections in Arab countries.
It's always playing a role.
But I wouldn't want to sign a lot of significance, it's not completely a single relationship.
However, it plays a significant role in German considerations.
Have German relations with the United States been declined when Germany had been fulfilled in the case of both important decisions, for example, in voting on Palestinian?
I think in Europe and even in the United States will have a great understanding for German positions.
That's why I don't think it was a dramatic crime as in the question of Libye.
Even from the Germany, it's a certain respect.
This signifies that the international player must be considered and its interests must be in mind.
In Europe there are different views of Palestinian initiative.
The United States were clearly spoken to the wind.
Is there a distinction between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed in the consequence of American internal policies.
I think the Government of Obama may have a significant understanding for European positions.
However, in the consequence of the secret political situation, this situation cannot, of course, remain publicly.
I think the differences in the views are actually not as big as they always feel.
When you look at relations between Obama and the Ministry President Netanjah, Obama does not have much over Netanjahua's policy.
Isn't it difficult for Germany to introduce their great relationship with Israel and the United States on one side and with the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that's exactly the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germany if it exists coherent and unique European policy, which is not at present.
So they cannot be part of larger lines, and they have to leave things from their own position.
They're just doing this with yours.
I believe that Germany will replace the rule of leadership in the future and will press Europe to the European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany because of relationship with Israel.
That's always a civil team.
But I think Germans are clear that they have to play the most independent role.
Do you see German himself in the role of a significant international player?
Or is the leadership role for Germany still hard?
Germany is still not normal, it's still inadequate, and for this country it's still hard to play more role.
For example, when we look at the European Crisis, then when Germany takes a greater role, the anti-nemic lands will be exceededed.
This doesn't make the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be explored by enemies.
In this regard, Germany is in a lot of difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for the most different neighbors and views, and it is not easy.
However, the impact of the United States in the European policy is not permanently fulfilled, but the EU does not fulfil this vacuum in the present time.
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Although they don't like it, they're inadequate, and they're doing it more unbelievable -- it's the life!
Stephen Szabo is the director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, a institution in which academic and experts in the policy of Europe and North America are together studying transatlantic community.
In addition, it is a German Marshall Fund, where he was specialized on German policy, the United States foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection mark" in China: when Puma and Armenia are the only Chinese

After this, it is hidden the marks that are completely registered in China, however, with the original company there is nothing common.
But he uses protections so long until they are required by real masters.
And even then, it's not clear if the rights are home.
"For the foreign is still more difficult to protect in China his tags," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who is specialised to prevent protection rights on the Down East.
Every week, my write table will be a new case.
The passengers have enough letters more to log in their tags.
Gucci's tag, for example, is Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada allow Prada-Kny to register Prada-Kny.
This way is legally copied by German companies, a manufacturer of the Sports of Puma.
Pattloch opens the officer with the records of the sign office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one of the Chinese company was left to protect the trade mark of Zegna DF Puma. A beautiful name that is compared to the model house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that Chinese masters of the world are in copying and destruction of soul property.
In large towns there are several commercial houses in which they almost sold boxes.
But the cases of Pattloch are different, and from the convincement of their mandators, China's companies are in contrast to receive the official right to use the marks which are already protected in somewhere.
The Chineses call it "Bang Mingpai", a composed tag.
This word is addressed to Bang Dakuan.
There are less women who have a lot of rich men.
The Chinese authorities don't know any sin.
"It's the business, we've got to get it," calls Pattloch.
"It's a difference, the exhibition is dismissed, the image's decoration is great."
Financial losses and judicial costs of posted branches are going to millions, especially in the favorite oxygen products.
According to the data of CLSA market research, China is a total of 15 billion eur per year of the third largest market of goods and markets that grow faster.
However, the explanation of doubts in the registration of the tag can be able to get hardly and something it is.
The ruling can be achieved until nine years, with the most important results.
Pattloch reports the cases when the court refused of disasters because the name has been called a long time after the "leading reality".
When he's an inquiry side, he needs to pay the plagueer, because he's cut his tag in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's a jungle law.
Known cases are also involved in graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler gained the legal sport with the producer of Sanya's establishment machines, a company who recently overcomed the German producer to the beton-smooth Putzmeister.
Thus, the Chinese can use the emblem which seems to the star of Mercedes.
The Geely community, which buyed Volvo, used originally the mobile white logo that recommended BMW. The sport was compared to Geely had to change the logo.
The Lacoste manufacturer of the Mobile Resources of Lacoste was played in China with the passengers from Hong Kong and Singapur, who turned aside with a separate direction.
The Chinese authorities don't know any sin.
The CTOM Agency also suggests that there was no need for the cause of too small number of employees and spaces in 2010.
But in the long-term year, "the work process has returned from the noise situation to the standard."
For instance, the number of non-processed shipping management was 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, the office is still waiting for 81 500 strips of equipment.
Something against this is delicious
As it is in China often, it's an impressioning numbers.
In the long-term year, the CTMO has been conducted more than 1,4 million requirements for the protection of tags, which are at least at the third time more than 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China's subsequent to himself brings a list of new meetings in the world.
It's also paid for the number of all valid protective tags -- it's a total of $5 million.
In 2011, 1,8 billion judians were chosen on boards.
Only, it means that each income in the middle of 1280 Jews or 160 euros.
The start of the sport is a number of cases, as indicates the case of the German family company of Freudenberg.
This concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiator over seven years.
However, Germany had obtained that his illegal manufacturer was interrupted.
Yet, the pattern made sure the Chinese rights to the brand of Freudenberg and further.
We would like to forget that, because it cannot be protected in Germany, Hanno Wentzler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Mnich.
The CTMO Office also rejected the shipment of the ministry.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has been housed rights, however, the refugee in the sport fights further to day.
It must be a terrible attention.
Now it's the issue of the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the thing will lead to the good end and glorify the professional of the courts.
But he also says, "The guidance is extremely valuable and stands for us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could not be calculated. In the company archive, they had to even look at hundred years old writings to provide evidence.
Five years ago, the Freudenberg company offered "the highest sixth part in yours" for the purpose of comparison of the sport.
"You see what this means for us," says Wentzler.
It's horrible that the dangers of the remote east will also cause Europe.
And that's what if the immigrants are there, they're sure they're saved of unsaved tags.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to in Germany to notify Freudenberg's notification for wood and cock.
This sector of trade activities has been longer reached, although it has been able to reduce the registration.
"It must be a terrible attention," says Wentzler.
He also advises Pattloch to German companies to be very careful in trade with China.
It's not enough to take care of the international brand rights. The strangers would almost have "all that is in any way to be protected, logging in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it may be much better than recording.
In fact, if the Freudenberg company in the last history of his drama will be marked, then it would probably have to pay the license payment for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pressed in a sport segment from the market.
World War Day against AIDS: duplication, singing, help
In Heidelberg, Imbongi’s congregation - and in Swedish, they have the joy of seroots after parents who died in AIDS.
The connection process that convinces more than 8733 kilometers.
First there's dumping: cockboy high boats, basketball boats, damage ships and pan muscles are looking for the park and quickly finding it.
One, two, three, four.
Then I'm so laughing up the songs - alt, bass, tenor and soap - they're dressed, mom, and they're stretched together.
The 29-year-year director Fiete Hopfa is almost smoking out of his textile bottles when he connects his voices in a lot of wonderful gestures.
It's lunch evening. In the musical Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the congregation of Imbongi is trying a new song.
Fifty songs and songs came between 23 and 69 years from the study of human genetics after the household.
"Om'Obani" is not easy, every church voice has another text and also in a very strange language - drum that speaks 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and Switzerland.
Help to help
Unids, the United Nations Organization for AIDS Aids Programme, describes that 34 million people who are infected by HIV infected in the world.
23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Switzerland there are 245,000 circles after parents died in AIDS.
HIV is already more than 40% of citizens.
For 180 surveys after parents died in the AIDS, in the Esitjin Island found Voices for African patrons in Germany.
70 of them visits the school of the second grade.
For 15 or 20 euros monthly, you can overcome the patron.
It guarantees children's school, university and one dark food day in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means in the cycle of "the story speaker" or also "the one who praises."
Nobody can speak in this area, just sing.
At least ten years, the congregation is singing in this strange speaker, and sometimes it also brings it back from where they are originally going: South Africa.
In the air distance of 8 733 km from Heidelberg, there is even at the north of the Sweden Islands of Esitgeni, which is conferred to the ability of the German congregation’s voices.
40% is infected
It lives in the field of 2000 people, some of them are still in a simple smoking or smooth smoke, and the largest part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have understood the virus of HIV.
In Esitgen, it is to see in the smallest, the whole Switzerland: the highest infection of HIV, the less expected life length in the world according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of a man's preliminary, which decreases the risk of half references, does not accept the citizenship.
More than 40% of people in Switzerland takes a virus of unlawed immunity in themselves, and there is no doubt that they die in the nearly thirty years.
This universe discovered the congregation on a common way after Africa on January 2005. However, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets that were not only parently mistaken but all: food, clothing, education.
Without the final school education, they have no chance in the poor country.
In the beginning, it was still a private investment of individuals who were allowed to send a child to school for a couple of euros for a year and give him a dark food day.
However, for a year later, the congregation was based on the "Voices for Africa" congregation that since that time is raised on surroundings after parents died at the AIDS, almost professionally.
Factory of sexually transported infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI is syphilis, chlamdyes and cave (gonorea).
Many viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomavires, genetal herpes or hepatitis.
Municipality and branches are parasitary SPI.
Who is the most attached group?
Syphilis and capabilities are especially in men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha is declared that at least four of the five cases of the syphilides that were spoken in Germany are transmitted to sexual contacts between men.
In theerosexual adults, there are sexually transported diseases that are often produced, chlamid infections, trichomonads, candidoz (e.g.), capacity and human papilomaviry.
HIV is in relation to us a few of theerosexual adults, but 20 per cent of the new HIVs are along with this group.
Between young people with chlamid infections are most often more than in other citizens groups.
According to the European investigations, three fourth of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, between young people often provide human palomaviry.
How was the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be spoken.
The number of loaded sifilids in accordance with Robert Kocha was 1697 disease in 2001 more than 3698 disease in 2011.
The number of new infected HIV is reduced since 2007.
In 2011, it was about 2700 cases.
It's a decade of a decade less than a year ago.
What signs are advertising to the heavy disease?
Infectious diseases may be able to call for genetaly, difficult to move, excuse, disease in the underbreak and steel or broadcast.
However, often do not affect any pain or other signs, and it is therefore not observed.
How can you protect them?
The dangerous indications can reduce the condoms, however, they do not provide a gradient protection.
For the origins of sexually transmitted diseases may be partly transmitted and infections with uncleanness and a serious physical contact.
Therefore, the experts recommend, especially in the case of a periodic management of sexual partners, a regular investigation.
In the case of time diagnosis, the majority of the SPI is possible to improve and protect later results.
Thanks to the patron, good gifts, and in the last sort of honourers who can sing throughout the Germany will gather some money.
"We have already sent 200 000 euros to Esitenia," says the President of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is carried out in the alone village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman that can be prosecuted.
It also assumes that the young children find more courageous, for example, at some of the grandfather.
Gogo, as it says to the old women in the dark tongue, they're in the boat of the ice.
Some of them also took 14 sirots, gave them a throat over the head and tried to get children every day at university in school.
Children who have nobody are going to escape to Khanyisile, a famous woman who pays together as two coffees who are day-day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" was also based on the school, two corners, and together with the American Health Organization of the PSI had decided that many people in the universe could not make HIV tests.
It's not obvious, even though she's sick in the entire country, everyone's lying about it.
King 14 marriages
"AIDS is absolutely a table," says Annette Lennartz, "the cause he has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, there is a very amazing land where the king is officially maintained by 14 marriages.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III., is known by his unmarried lifestyle.
Polygame in place of democracy.
This State approved ways of life is also caused to be the cause of HIV virus in the past decades so rapidly expanded.
But too many migrant workers who developed the virus through the land.
Annette Lennartz says that the condoms are even at every roof, "but no one uses them.
Culture is another - unsaved piece."
To support at least a little cultural exchange, the assembly of Imbongi walks once for two, three years together after south Africa and sing a writer of full challenge, war, confidence in the future and of the Black Continent, which many in the Southern Continent still know from the time of apartment.
A bus full of white people who sing sing in black words - such appreciation brings not only reward and joy, but also have been spreaded in many strangers of the border soldiers.
The path is always going to Esitgen, where the songs visit children who have a patron.
Although this universe steals on maps, there is more than known in the field of Azulveni river.
"Go to Esitgen, there's light," people say there.
And when you come back to Heidelberg, which is a 8733 miles from here, to the white songs in experimentally to Bergheimer Straße, you see that it's light and here.
Messaging: NASA is located to Mercuru
Sonda Messenger found evidence that he's on the Merkur planet.
It could have a lot to 20 meters.
The United States National Airport and Cosmonativity (NASA) showed the existing aircraft on the Merkur planet.
Although the nearest Sun is close, there is also a wounded water, as it spreads out of three studies that in the fourth century published the beautiful magazine "Science".
Sonda Messenger found evidence that in the area of this planet, which is living in the permanent dark, there is a wooden steel.
It's at least 30 centimeters, and it's possible even to 20 meters strong.
This water came according to all of the comates or even from the asteroids that were cut down to the Mercury.
But let's not take the air into the relationship with existing life on this planet, he said the leaders who work on the Messenger Sunday, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Merkur can get up to 426 Celsia grades.
However, Naalesy could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life were achieved in other areas of the sun.

One of the largest and most amazing pictures of Hubble Telescope: faith galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies are in the context of their colors.
The officer published by the European South Water, shows several thousands of light years from Trifid's remote milk in the surface of the Shooter.
The name of Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (separated on three parts, three parts), because the dark branches of the plot shares this star birthday on three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonoses astronomics photographed the prevention of spaces: in the distance of 400 million light years from Earth, a woman of two spreading galaxies and must not be unreasonable to coliz.

Our views to the universe: the most important telescopes
The remote view found in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. It was still used before Galilee Galilee for a year later to observe the star.
Since that time, the optical distances still increased - and the views that are focused are still more deep.
The largest spectrum in the world was 30 years, and it was from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope on the observers of Palomar near San Diega.
The image was a half of five meters.
In the American Arizona, there are large binocular telescope.
It allows to look at the universe using just two cycles, each of which has average 8,4 meters.
Gran Telescopio Canarias in one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is serious. It's just a middle of 10,4 meters.
Zrcadlo Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reach costs.
Although its average has the rate of 11 meters.
Inevitableness of the left form of construction: the telescope is ensuring with a high-screen steel, which is limited to its movement.
In the highway, the telescope is fixed and the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
His speciality is a high green smoking of light.

The Cosmical Telescope Kepler is a party from March 2009 after extrasolation planets - especially after those who are citizens.
2. February 2011, NASA stated that from the beginning of the mission, 1235 candidate planets were detected.
The last preparations are documented on the image before Kepler's universe telescope is launched.
The universe district James Webba (JWST) will first be shooted in the universe at the Ariane Rackets 5 in 2018.

The scientists are out of that the ice is on the south of the Merkur.
However, there are no relevant data for this planet, because the Messenger rounds around this planet close to the north field.
Radar measurements have been shown for a few ten years that it is in the Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger branch, which was sent in 2004 and is the first in the area of Mercur, the scientists now have confidence.

Even there is a long-term museum.

Searching in the country where 97 people are still relatively young.
I'm going to go, Talish, we can call a romantic divorce.
Microbus will raise on the road with many balls with a lot of cuts, low river, and simple self structures.
Everything is green and amazing, like, we're in Blackzwald.
However, this is the weirdest South Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away.
It lives here the cavacastic ethnic group of the Talish who does not know too much, except that he speaks perfectly in Persian and Azerbaijan and has a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is a lot of monumental architecture from the Soviet Time, which is sometimes disagreeable in small mountains.
The Turists of Europe are not here, but the coming from Azerbaijan's main city of Baku is too easy.
323 kilometers are required for eight hours, because the streets are only one-proof.
The poor riches for which the country gives thanks to the Nafth in the Caspace Sea have not yet been achieved.
However, Pilate Fatulajev (48) is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku blessed the Great Price of Eurovise in May - and we will have the next year the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaev.
He's a director of long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here's documented life at least eight tattoos of Talish's around which are older hundred years old. Fatulaje shows black-white photos.
It's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136, he's born a child.
However, the smooth star of this museum is the sheep of Shirali Muslumov, which was fully 168 years old.
However, the family letter doesn't exist.
And in view of the elder man with evidence of 122 years, the age of Muslim appears to be a countrywide.
"He was born in this area in 185 and 1973," explains Fatulaje.
This man was three times married and had 23 children.
So, wasn't Shirali Muslumo in his age about a few ten years?
However, Rembrandt Schulz also heard about the aeroplanck people in Central Asia, the architecture of Max Planck in Rostock.
"Incidentally, many people live in some of the Chinese areas, Japan, or in the field of Hunza in Pakistan," says Schulz, "the people in Sardinia live extremely many very old men."
However, because of the missing bases, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when the matrices are missing.
Each day of the locked steel
However, the fact is that people in the area around Lerique are increasingly often enjoying the Bible’s age.
In the present time there are 20 persons who are older than 100 years.
So why do you live here in the south of a lot of years?
Azerbaijan's chief Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special gens of Talyish.
The director of the Museo Fatuljea believes that it's in life.
However, it is that exactly the calorical cup of Talish who love meat, bread, and especially meat products, and of which many days drink the cup of the rolled meal, is so healthy, the bromatic view doesn't seem faithful.
Or is this the original way of life that keeps young people in Cengegar, a small part of the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajev.
In 97 years, this landing width is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, who says that he has 143 descendants, lives in a simple tree house that is typical for the whole Cavcast region.
They're sitting on the ground with an emergency, which is not collisionally.
On one side, eight people live here, besides one of the sons of Mirzaje and the daughters.
Two little children are smoking on the bottom.
In the kitchen, it's prepared for the hosts the tea that is given in the typical "harmad" tickets.
The white dress of Mirzaje creates a perfect row and hides a long dark blonde copy, whose gorge covers her son before us.
I've always missed the hairs of a milk, so they didn't look up and keep the color.
"I never used the champagne," says Mirzaev.
Monthly life interest is sufficient
She's always eaten what happened from her own shoes, rackets, brambles, games.
For my whole life, I didn't buy food on the supermarket once.
Then he tells me about his man who was in the army.
That was the worst for the second world war.
But everything was better when the wood overseased Geidar Aliev.
Propaganda seems strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult that is around the statutes of the father of the nations who ruled his land as a diktator, in Azerbaijan does not know the border.
He was in the power until 2003, then he took his son Ilham.
The old people in Azerbaijan are at least unbelievable.
Mirzajeva gets amount of 230 manates every month (by approximately the same part of yours). This is the rate of the rate of which it will be good to live.
And maybe he has the truth and the old son of Mirzaiah, saying, "The stars of men live in our culture of great truth."
They live in the middle of the large families, are loved, rejoiced and happy.
If it's not a reason to stay in life as far as far as
Human Rights Cache in the statement
The revolution returned to Kahiry.
The exploited demonstrations in Kahira declined the deep disposal of the country.
The office is discussed about the future position based on the right of the shadow.
The Egyptian President didn't shoot the pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And because of this, I'm responsible for people and before God," he said in the State TV.
His word was defined to the whole nation, especially to Christian Kapts, liberals, light muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still unexpectedly discovered in the crashed obsession, they have fear.
The fear of "the God of the State" on Nilu delivered to the powerful Muslim's brothership.
Mohammed Mursy had almost obviously dealt that he had limited the competence of the statutory court and expanded his own to "protect the revolution".
However, the 61-year engineer who has the title of the American University in South California really wants to save, there are not the United States or the world clearly.
Does the judicial power be disappeared?
234 paragraphs, which are attached to the establishment meetings with the supervision of islamists, have rapidly approved in the 15-year maratone, are partly exhausted.
As in the previous statements, the jurisdiction is also based on the "reseasures of the Islamic Law".
But what does it mean "sheets"?
It was, and it was the issue, and it could be afraid that the Islamists of this islandic formulation and the legal free space with it uses for the most precious expenditure of the sharia.
At least it explains the new added paragraph: In all the cases concerned with sharian, it is necessary to consult the University of Al-Azhar, which is the most significant islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole Sunitarian island.
It is not necessary, but it may mean that clerus will carry out a monitoring of law, which would bring the judge to the fact that its own right.
In the proposal, there are many expenditures
The problem is also that the civil authorities of the military courts should be continued to be maintained.
These courts served by the Government of Mubarak to punish the obsession.
After the fall of the dictionary, there was to be 11,000 civilists in military range.
As they are in the proposal, it should also be protected by "the right basis of the Egyptian family and supporting its moral and values."
This is a legal page formed so immediately that by this paragraph, the State institution could even control the contents of film science and literature.
In understanding, it doesn't mean anything else than the prize.
Recently, no paragraph does not explicitly limit the equality of men and women.
This is why another paragraph commands to hazard or to deceive the prophet Mohamed and his messengers.
However, it remains unexpected to what it is, and how it will be broken.
It's likely to make a formula that it is deleted by "the destroying of people."
Does the president's caricature have already been done in this case, or is it a funeral to account of the laws?
Moreover, as many of the other in this proposal, which Mursy proposes to sign and, according to their words, will "come soon" represent the Egyptians for the purpose of human vote.
"Revolution has come back."
A few weeks ago, the opposition against islamists is formed.
Thousands of people were gathered together in the unnormal dignity at the fifth evening at Tahrir's destination in Kahira and promised to destroy the original list until they began paying.
"The Revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who placed in the President's choices on the third place.
Nobellov's Nobel prices and an old General Director of the International Agency for the Atom Energy Mohamed Baradès announced that the proposal of the schedule is "in the story".
In the middle of the short reports of Twitter, Mursy's advice has committed that they want to carry out "poach against democracy".
"When the referendum is reported, we'll go to his palace, and we'll throw him up," said Jasir Said's opposition.
"Now we are not suffered, the blood of our brothers is not yet suffered," said the Egyptian media of the opposition policy Chalida Aliho.
Some judges announced that they don't want to see the referendum, which would happen wrong.
"The Koran is our mouth."
The well-organized Muslim brothership reported an air-demonstration, however, not to the subject of Tahrir, but after a great prayer on the other side of Nilu before the Caribbean University.
Many of the wounded women and the partners of the salaphists who called, "Man requires the implementation of God's law."
They cried to the Mursy: "Peace the earth!" and saved: "The Koran is our mouth."
The fight against the symbolic target of Tahrir, on which all began to choose the state of a similar civil war.
This Mursy's representative was obviously not wanted to risk.

Norwegian rackfish: The most cutting fish in the world?
Five million people in Norway use one of the most highest life standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Can the secret of the success of the country be linked to the local apept for a married fish?
Take a few overseers.
Place them in the middle of spiral and mockful photoball equipment.
Let it lie a week.
So you can get the paralysed racks, one of the largest northern delikats.
I'm in a small city of Fagernes, three hours from Osla.
It's a dream, a beautiful view - and in the air, it's all awful snow.
Rakfisk is a wounded bird in the water for a year - it's interesting for how much you want to smoke the fish.
As it comes to be hungry and starts to be hungry, the Normans here in Fagernes are starting to celebrate the festival of this, how to say it is the best, the most softest food.
"You're going to be a syrn and then drink a skinwave," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional hazard, but also called "Rakfisk General", which is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat little fish cows and drink them with a large number of alcohols.
"Some people like waterbits than rakfisk," says Havard.
Foods can be able to overcome the skins.
I'm trying a couple of cows.
If the fish can get out of your nest, it's not so bad - it's like sush, which was on a long bus path.
Rakfisk is a very different period of poverty in Norway, and because there were no aircrafts, the fish were driving in aircrafts with water and soil.
Then we are in the middle of the midst when they were well excited, out and eating - the minds would be unfortunately overcome alcohol.
Before a generation, thousands of Norians were urgent to leave their land and search for work, and most of them emigrated into the United States.
In the present time, the population is quickly grown - more than 13% of the imigrants creates a large number of work, high training and a wide treatment system.
The Sweden residents, the old rival that had been recently more rich than Norway, lead to the country for work.
Raphic is considered as something important, unreasonable, even though directly endorsed part of the northern earlier.
It's between the better food on the market.
Even if the love is all - a small drink cup or a sandwich is going to get you out to 9 libres (14 dollars) for a kitchen.
Norway is often not in the world reports - and most people are likely to do so.
The name of Anderse Breivika, the right rasist extremist, who shoot 77 men, women and children in the past year, are still reduced with disasters.
Instead of this, the shooting is called "the damnness of July 22."
Norways can only believe that in their medium country there was one of them that could have achieved such brutality and murder.
Today, Norway is the growth of one of the largest world-wide and plant industries from the beginning of the 70th century.
"But it's not the only reason why it's so good for us," says she's on the introduction of the talars with a white raffic with our rings of Anna, who with his long blonde hair and surprising blue eyes represents the prototype of the north happiness.
We're as you're talking about, aware of people.
She's English, like the English of most people, is extremely unfair.
We're not going forward, we don't like the show.
Norway is attached to its very careful richness - except a small percentage, most of the money of this sector is invested into a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading to the world's finance cut off the money that they had not had, the Norway had the smokes in their months.
"Think we can smile in the shadow and walk in the west year, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an unfortunate smile.
I'm in the snow front of something to eat, I've already got enough.
That burger's probably something else and it's beautiful.
But evening is a nice fish again here.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where the rakphic is given to the dinner and where hosts call the best, or even for those the most fair fishing.
They have a connection with a living television transfer in which the moderator is with a cloud tail with the rack.
It's like Eurovise's hot conquest.
"What shooter do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thore-Jurgene?"
"There is our point, Havarde."
It's called a smile and a smile.
With a damn man, maybe a powerful aquavite.
Or maybe all of these fish.
Enrique Pena Neto from Mexico has a hard start
As the Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto is prepared for the Office, looks for Will Grant from the BBC for the calls that are officers, and for the excessive expectations of their colleagues.
The transport in Mexico City is particularly bad in the present time.
In the city, even in those best times, there were a number of key travels to the main town and carried out on the road chaos.
Nevertheless, the objective was not to reject the achievement of the employment, but to refuse the protestant in access to the Parliament.
On the Sabbath, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena This will receive the president's shirt and transmit the leadership of the nation.
It's a nice job.
Mexican officer of Felipe Calderona was a good business, however, the country is in drug wars that had already been offered for a victim of 600,000 lives for six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said President Pena Neto the American President Barack Obam in the Working Work at the beginning of this week.
I will discard the new security strategy that allows us to achieve this goal.
Before he took his hand with the American President, President Pena Neta received political experience as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
The new leaders are also distinct in his old household, humanitarian and distributed state that covers the main city.
It's a nice man.
For example, in the foreign city Valle del Bravo, they remind him of him in good.
The citizens urge the development of tourism in the aircraft and the construction of infrastructures.
To the city now you can get one of the new dialers that had left Pena Neto to build. These deals are a larger improvement for the railway and helbolic motors that were before.
The Disc with his name also refers to the wall of the modern sport and the imposition interactive museum with climate changes.
"We hope that it will bring real and permanent change," says the friend and political partner Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the State Board of President Pena Nieta, the Site of the Institutional Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope in interesting and real changes in security and economic areas that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in the power, the PRI page was exhausted by Vicent Fox.
The messenger Olvera admits that after 12 years, the president's ball Los Pinos is waiting for a lot inside from Enriqua Pena Neta.
And denied the statement of the absence of the new president as a person without a sustainable content.
It's a very rich man, very excited with a wonderful land.
He's a great Stater, and mostly he's a man who can hear.
But on the other hand of the State, this is not a gain that has from his old government of many people.
In Nehualcoyotl, as well known as Ciudad Neza, can not be contrary with the lowest Valle del Bravo streets.
A lot of remote traveling in many recalls the objectives of the own main city of Mexico.
And the problems in the samose right neighbors are also raised and cities.
At the beginning of this year, the army was invited to help the control of drug gangs operating in fourth, especially the violence of women.
Only in the past two years, there were in the fields of fields in the great dealings of the department was brought to the body of tattoos murdered women.
During Pena Neto Governor, more than 1.000 women were killed in Mexico, which is more than in the notoric violence town of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is a synonym for innocent women.
In the best case, Pena Neta crisis says that in their operation in the office, the murder problem was unable to be inadequated with a murder problem.
And in the worst case of his guidance, they are accused of closing the eyes.
In Beton's house, typical for the ransom fourth, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of his dreamed daughter Mariana Luny and throws a plot.
According to the official version, Mariana was killed in 2010.
However, her family believes that she killed her partner.
"When I came to her house, it seemed like her body would be slow," remembers Mrs. Buendia.
There were marks on him after the dead and she started a dead loss.
As her mother tells his story, Mariana looks down from the image on the wall, immediately next to the cross, on which the only word is, "It is righteousness."
However, this is what the family says, exactly what was given to them.
The State authorities had been driving to me as if I had been an older threat, difficulty, and privacy.
They want you to just accept what they say and wear.
"But it can't be right when it came to a lot of mistakes and forget," says.
The Sherp, president Pena Neto, is granted to a great responsibility.
In the past six years, ten thousand families in Mexico were held by violence, and the new president promised that after his operation in the office would be his priority.
"I hope that he will be the same president as the Governor," says in Valle del Bravo, an elder of PRI Olver.
But it is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are the most afraid.
Bradley Manning didn't suffer to the bad manage, the military procureur
The military procureur is trying to make up Bradley Manning's threat to the severe investment.
The hearing is measured on Maning's residence in a military construction in Quantico town in Virginia.
Obhajoba wants to be denied on the basis of a serious manage with Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of the rate of thousands of secret documents.
The military procurator is trying to demonstrate that the army of Bradley Manning, who is accused of the most secret material in the history of the United States, has made a lot of opportunities to steal on the severe training that he has suffered in the military system.
Ashden Fein at the cross audience of the military military manning at the pre-earlier audience in Ft. Maede in Maryland stated that we reported weekly visits which Manning had with the members of the units for nine months in Quanticu in Virginia.
The cross-review that occurred in the process of hearing on the proposal of debt to refuse the case leading against Manning because of a severe disaster in the time of suffering, which was suitable, was a day after Manning had witnessed that he had considered himself as a murder.
The analysis of Army Debates held in June 2010 is accused by the rate of thousands of secret documents in their service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the fifteen hearing, Fein was a military procureur with Manning formals who had been fulfilled after meeting Manning in Quanticu, where he was held up from July 2010 to April 2011.
Maning's officers asked questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him in the fifth of these forms, Manning admitted that the achievement of the parties of his guard was a "increasing" and the entire driving in the equipment was valued as "excellent professional".
Formulators don't show any debt on the wrong conduction, even though the agent Manning asked directly how he was coming with him, he said Fein.
Manning replied that the fears regarding various problems were expressed with awareness and that the officers who visited him were talking to him about these fears and said that they would take care of them, but they didn't not announce these problems.
"They said no problem" (after they discussed fears), and it wasn't necessary to mean that I didn't mention them," said Manning.
Denise Lind also asked Manning why he didn't take up his person in January 2011 when he met with the Commission on auto-sexual thoughts that had been expressed for a few months ago in the formula.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to reduce the "prevention of destruction".
The army pointed out that this limiting mode (one grade under control of self-association) used for his protection and security of others.
"I wanted the supervisors to know that I'm okay and I wanted to interrupt this mode of preventing destruction... that I could use the highest quality of life as I saw it here," said Manning.
Manning, on the fourth, tested his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held at least two months before he was transported into the conserved prison in Quanticu in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he was in Kuwait considering a murder, and one time he went down there because of the tea.
He showed that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him, and what happens in the world was very comfortable.
"My world was smiled only on the base of Arifjaan, on the kitchen," said in Maning fourth.
I thought I'd die in that clothe.
Manning pointed out that after coming to Quantica, he spent most days (minimum 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small total without any company.
Manning said he was allowed to have only one matrage, covering, shopping, some clothes and branchs.
He said that he was trying to walk because he was sleeping or just leading on the day against the laws.
Manning showed that he's always sleeping with the light from the outside of the objectives in the eyes.
He showed that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side, they raised him and had to turn him back.
Maning's legal manager made formal courage to conduction with Manning's soldier in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
In the fifth, the judge Manning also asked the accusations that he brought in the fourth explanation, regarding that after he was given to sleep a night in his goal in Quanticu, he was also inquired to stay neighborhood before the guard and other communities in the morning.
Manning stated that when he was counted, he was not allowed to hide his covering.
On the fifth audience of the judge Manning stated that from the command of his guards he said that he had a cover that could be hidden, but he recognized that no one had given his command to her department.
In the fourth night, Manning stated that he was donuted to sleep nah, because he tried to show that he wasn't dangerous.
Manning showed that he said to the officer he could use a ship from his board hair or his permissions to hurt, but he didn't do it.
Manning stated that the night was removed from his destination, his slide, his skins and bracelets.
His lawyer hopes that he takes his experience in court from his prison and that in the case of his statement before the military court that the beginning is expected at the beginning of the next year, he explicitly reduces his trespass.
Behajoba said that he planned that Manning is committed to sin in lower crimes and that he will fight against other offences because they are too extremely.
The start of hearing is planned for this week, it is expected that the military procureur will preserve the vacuum conditions as appropriate.
Pentagon announced that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions relating to all prisoners held in the treatment of max.
In the middle of accusation against Manning, the help of enemies, the legislative publication of informal documents on the Internet, the transmission of information on national security and the public possession or records.
If it is accused in all points, it may be judged for life.
My crisis of Mexico-American identities
She says that many people were able to leave Mexico because of the unrequired opportunities they are there.
The Mexicans have a crown to win those who have gone; they remind them of hard times, says.
Navarrette says that the Mexico Americans are laptops between two worlds.
On the last path to the main city of Mexico, I was sold by the dawn, and I came to the space for the imigrants agents, where I raised the problem.
The pipes were shown to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicans" and the other for "Extranieros" ("Scientific").
I stayed there a few seconds and I didn't know where I should go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called Mexican.
It's an ethnic shortcut, like when my friends in Boston are called "Iry" and my friends in New York themselves are "Italy".
So later, I've finished the "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my father's house wasn't necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I'm speaking Spanish, too well to do both sides of conversation in this language.
However, I don't have a parent speaker's words, and I can't be free of the American call.
So I went out my American pass and stood in the front for "Extranieros".
I was thinking about the moment when this week the new mexican president Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obama.
On the programme, they had a regular issue that will take place when the leaders are meeting these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of Mexico economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans remain in Mexico as they go to the United States.
He wants to connect to the United States and Canada and create a trade block similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neto promised that he would continue in the Mexico War against drug carts, even though he had no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemies.
Most of the Americans probably never thought that in 1848 the United States had attacked Mexico and used his leader under the weapons to rewrite half of the Mexico area in the United States.
But for the Mexicans who think in the age of the centuries, not for minutes, are reminders of all.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little critical about Mexico, you can hear in Mexico pressure and between the elite of stress on how the Americans contain suffering of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezumy are going to go to war.
But for Mexico, it is a real relationship with more than 35 million Mexico Americans in the United States.
You want to talk about the enemy feelings?
That's a lot of things.
In Mexico, there are victories and gains, people who offer the country, and others who are not.
The only reason why many people live with Mexico roots in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in some points of our family tree was a person, possible parents or birthman who had received the opportunity and had to go north in Mexico.
And more than it seems, this person replied the profile - dark coffee, bad education, origin of the poor ice andd.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to him.
Don't go to Mexico.
And even though we live now American dream, we walk good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live American dream, not Mexico.
Our identity may sometimes be uncomfortable, but our loyalty is not.
He's in the United States.
And we know that many of the elite Mexicans who are in the government class doesn't like us.
This feeling is a single.
He sees us as a reminder of low suffering and looks at us as a subtract race that is not enough Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be good, our way to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is only because of their opinion about mistakes.
If our families in Mexico wouldn't let her leave.
And we wouldn't find a prisoner now, with a good life in the United States, but even with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadaljar and in childhood, was legally accessed to the United States, reminds me that between Mexico and Mexico, there is an embarrassment because the Mexicos understand what they are, and the Mexico Americans do not have it.
Even if she's a party of the United States, she looks like a part of two countries.
And today, many of the Mexico Americans, who know, do not feel as part of one.
We love mexic groups, Los Tigres del North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You'll get it the best from both countries, but you don't have the roots.
In Mexico, he looks for us as Americans.
And in the United States, we were considered Mexico.
And to be more complicated, some of the mexic leaders and part of intelligence, as I learned when I was out, want to relax with the diapora again.
They want mexic Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and make mexic interests in the United States.
We should tell our American communities how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to enhance relations with Mexico.
No.
So it's not going to happen.
A lot of enemy feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of the accommodation and long-breed corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it's a great country.
I feel like it's for you, buddy.
It's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States as they worked with Mexican before one and half century, they must accept the fact that some Americans still feel not asking how they were associated with their families in particular more age.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battle, New Neighbor East
The end of the palms between Israel and Hammash could still be the fundamental basis for peace.
Can sometimes have a long peace between the Arabic and the Jews at the nearest east?
Another blowing round indicates that each of these accidents is bad.
In the middle of general resident agreements on who started it, many buildings were changed in the throne, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilists, and six Israelites. Firstly, the rackets of Gaza were affected near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropole, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelites and the Palestinians seem to have seen in their long conflict, all around them will change the nearest east.
The Arab Year has changed old arrangements and Palestinians and Israelites, so that they should like or not, they are arrested in a caos in the region.
Maybe it makes their fight more blood than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it can stop their death path situation.
The war that doesn't win nor will perish.
In the first view, it seems that in the present time there are no many reasons for optimism.
Even if the locking of the balls closed on November 21, the wars of this week would have been shipped by rows on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic Affairs in Gaza since 2007, will state that the Israelites have used to steal, even though Gaza had suffered a threat.
Even through the killing of several leaders of Hammas and closeing 1,7 million Gazy citizens in one of the most accused and the most vulnerable coats of the planet, the Israelites did not allow Hamas to destroy.
And in fact, Hamas has the impact on the West Bord, another Palestinian coast, which is currently raised by his striving rivals from Fatahu, the more dead Palestinian fraction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hammas can be very good to admit that the time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world received greater influence, so Hamas received powerful and rich friends.
Turkish, the renounced regional power that had ever been the nearest Muslimian association of Israel, was added to the side of Hammas, and Katar, one of the most poor and traditional countries in Zaalia.
The people of Hammas say that the Islamic half of the Israelites, around the north of Libano, where the side/milice Hizballah, over Syria, where the rebels, who are still more clonning to Islamism, may sit down Bashara Asada, to Jordan, where the bonds of Hammas are over the kings.
And in particular, on the southern side of Israel, Moslem's brothership was changed under the leader of the President of Muhammad Mursí in Egypt, the greatest and strongest Arab country, equal in the region.
Huswa Mubarak, a secular department that ruled in Egypt 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hammas.
Brother's brother Hamas, and his leaders are more influenced by public ministry.
In the future diplomacy, Hammas can appear as a player that cannot be excluded by Israel or America.
In addition, the Israelite residents will come to deep ends.
In the military termology, Hammas was stored back to bed.
The Israeli anticracket system of Yellow Cockle proved his price and a lot of Hammas was destroyed.
The Israelites may be better sleeping - a minute.
In diplomatic terminology, America is the same as always, and many European countries have also sinned Hamas from the beginning of the last round of violence.
And mainly - Israel prospered, especially under the leader of Benjamin Netanjahua, the President of the Government, which mostly ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rackets were killed at about 30 Israelites since 2004, he was directly quiet in Israel from their own robbers, from the part of the walls in the west side, the main part of the Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish assemblies that continue to develop and through their contrast against the international law.
Premier Netanjah, whose side of Likud was on the beginning of the campaign to the elections of the 22th year, associated with the rather radical group leader Abigdor's loverman, is in a good position.
Why to disappoint those Palestinians to give them their own state?
If they really go on the west side, wouldn't they burn rackets, as they did their country in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind the wall and we'll shoot them when he shoots the heads.
Perhaps the residents of severe lines will win, however, the Arab Year can change their payment.
Even though the Islamists who have power in Egypt and other countries have Israel not too much in love, their priority will be raised with home problems.
Israel's costs for protection are higher than the expenditure of all its four Arab seats together.
The start of new wars with the local superintendency field will help the new Arab government to heal its economics.
The fact that President Mursy collaborated with President Barack Obamou to get the loading of the balls is a good sign, and it can mean the beginning of something new.
Moreover, the Israelites should look at the situation of a long view.
At the time that the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates the exploitation of Palestinian rights to self-defense with a shooter, which must be explored one day in the areas of Israel's occupied - as a bus that has explored last week in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already endured in the democracy and democracy in the Jewish State, and this situation is still deceived how the Arab population grows.
Blood accidents against Gaze every few years in order to punish Hamas will still choose more diplomatic money.
Both sides need proofs.
The answer is what understanding people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these news: two States when Israel will cause the field of security.
In a short-code examination, there is a little hope that the stop of the balls provides pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the processing of this thing.
Egypt, joined with Turkey and Katarm, must be able to stop a weapons to Gaza, has better position than ever to convince Hammas to accept the thought of the Jewish State based on borders from 1967 with the exchange of parts of the land and part of Jerusalem.
The Arabic exhibition also needs to press the agreement between Hammas and Fatahem.
This would have done more than an unindirect proposal for the establishment of Palestinian State in the United Nations.
President Obama also has his part in the way to bring Israel to the one table.
At its first choice period, the presentation of its own peace plan was immediately made.
Now, back in the White House, it seems to be the same tolerable in its income to the process.
That's a short-scream.
America has an important interest in the stabil east.
This means peace comparison between Israel and Palestinian.
In Australia, the law on smooth cigarettes were established
On the invisible green boxes that are the same for all tab labels are drawn warnings for hair and disease parts of the body.
The Australian laws have entered into the world’s first type of tabac and cigarettes, and the logo and the colors have replaced all the green oil boxes with happy images of disease parts of the body and showing children and new births by the persecution of their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the names of the labels are expressed by the same small letter.
It is one of the most precious modes in the world relating to the tattoo balance.
The Australian Federal Government says that the goal is to repeat young people from purchasing that this disorder will save his attitude.
The studies show that if people don't begin to buy 26 years, it's 99% of the chance that they're never beginning to buy.
"And in very small children you can see that you understand a message that the tabak society tries to sell them together with their product," says the federal Ministry of Health of Tanya Plibersek, and quotes studies that show that children have a crown in the log of thinking to be a principle.
While Australia has one of the less numbers of cupcakes in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the cycle of the national society, other countries consider the introduction of continuous steps.
The tax industry against the implementation of these laws was hardly lobby.
The Tabak company stated that this law increased trade on the black market, which will bring to the left and available cigarettes.
"Thanks this legislation will be a serious increasing consequences," says Scott McIntyre from the British American Tobacco Australia.
In China and Indonesia passengers bring more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others say that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand on the cigarettes of the cygarettes from the force of the service to cover the smokes, two months ago, when the British American Tobacco company, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had played their challenge to the laws to the most highest court, increased from the point of NULL.
She said that the Zico company sold at least 6000 coins to the large-country sold and waits for new resources.
It's a good business for us.
As possible, experts introduce the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is measured.
After all the Australian laws prohibiting the TV reklame, sponsoring sport events and required to hide cigarettes before the right view, the tabak marketing has been moved on-line.
Australia has committed the Internet reklame by local companies and web sites, however, it cannot be limited to foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tabak industry and remains only this small space for propagation of your products, it's a online space in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the public health area at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman announced a higher evaluation of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "medium Honzo".
We need to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves the cigarettes of Marlboro and gave her work and created this video, or is the marketing company in this?
The British American Tobacco Australia says that the industries have been involved in how they set up new provisions than on marketing.
The review was so far that Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic paid for the attack of new provisions - countries in the World Trade Organization pronounce that the trade is unjustly restricted, in particular that none of the countries with Australia does not mean significantly.
The conclusion of the SOO decision is expected at half of 2013.
The Ministry of Plibersek says that the Government has led a conversation with other governments considering similar laws in respect of fear.
Canadian was the first country that introduced the needed warning photos in 2001.
Now it has been expanded in more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Regarding more laws, the Great Britain, the New Zealand, the South African Republic and India are considered.
A lot of cows in Australia are lifted up.
I don't have any influence on pictures.
I just ignore them.
"It's just going to get a cigarette and a cocktail back," says Victor El Hage when buying cupcakes with nourish photographs in the mouth.
Truly, it's just one reason to stop fucking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, whose own trafic of King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, says that thanks to the single kitchen is more difficult for him to equippe in the guarantees.
"I've been able to get a little hour, now I've got four hours," said Yu.
"The power should just deny them, and then we'll say, "Okay, it's the end, we'll close the wall," he said and decided with his hands.
In the world's unfortunate connection is not so bad to be disappointed
The last day of thanksgiving, I was unexpectedly traveling five hours on the airport when our aircraft had a mechanical difficulty and we had to wait for the next airport.
So we had a lot of time to think about the wedding.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
At least half day at the air for the next year, it's a good time, even through the distribution of books, magazines and iPhone (including duty-free business).
But some scientists and experts on children's development are still more coming with the glorious wealth.
They say that for us (and our children) is good to marry sometimes.
The brain will go to the interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And in view of that most of us are not constantly connected to some screens today, we have no opportunity to benefit.
So we need to support the nudge?
Yes.
No, no.
But I'm going back to that.
First, as many people, I imagined that the nudity was a new show that has come to the coming of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history on the Canadian University in Calgary, who is author of the book of Boredom: A Lively History (History Nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, there's a lot of story," he said.
In the walls in Pompei, there was a Latin record on the nudes from the first century of our airport.
And then, it's also the question of how we define the nudity.
It is difficult to be defined and discussed in many different ways, John D. Eastwood, a psychologist professor in the York University in Ontario in Canada.
After looking at the research literature and the introduction of the objective group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined noise as an experience, "I wanted to do something that would be pleased, but I wasn't able to do it."
Nuda is different from the aptation that a person is not given to anything but she wants to be.
She says there's no need to do anything in the packy.
He says that the nudge nuclear is "unlocking the warning process connected to a bad rate and a potency of a short time."
Nuda can remember a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, the tendents have a problem as an environment or the world, while people who are in the depression are seeing a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're naked, when we're only difficult to focus.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the period Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed the last experience in which the participants listed to the ship, on which a person reads the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a voice and unreasonable TV program in the nearby room, others heard it so convinced that they heard it, while the third group didn't hear it.
Those who have heard the threat of the television program reported more noise than the two other groups -- had difficulties to focus, but they were not sure why and described these weaknesses.
When you are trying to focus on a hard or hard task, you can interrupt attention to the neighborhood, Mark J. Fenske, a neurologist professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something weird, "come it's looking for bad parts on the company line, it can spread music to help you not to be able to be."
In fact, he said, now we know that the crown and the smoking that often looks like the sign of the nuds can really help fight with the nuds and keep people physically more careful.
"The investigation shows that the children who are allowed to go back will learn more and keep more information than those who are urgent to sit in silence," said Professor Fenske.
We've all lived a nudge -- my plane, a smoking player, especially a long-term film.
But some individuals have greater chances to wear than others.
To help scientists to measure the nudity of scientists in the past 80th century, they developed "Stoppnice for Nudity" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The Student takes questions as "More things I have to do is repeat and is monoton," and "I have much interests that I have no time to do."
The help of these scientists found that the boys have tendencies to be more than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and especially if it is necessary to have more and different external stimulation.
However, the teengers are generally neutral.
In 1991 Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Social Development on University of Illinois, made an experiment in which he contacted at least 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times.
He discovered that 32 percent of adults showed that they were in school and at home works, while 23 percent showed that they were nudged when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents showed that they were naked.
Professor Larson said that he didn't know whether the percentage of noise was now, about 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "the summer is the highest time for noise" which is in significant measure caused to make children and young people no longer control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is it a good nud to you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in their extern form, people can lead to avoid absurd physical risks, play rare games, or disturb the vessels as a way to reduce it.
On the other hand, many philosophy and writers discussed the connection between noise and creation, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied a problem after more than two decades.
"It's a way to give you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychologist professor at the U.S.U...
But the brain doesn't always know the most important thing you should do.
If you are weak and use this energy to play on the kitar and the vaccin, it will make you happy.
But if you're looking for the TV, it will make you happy for a minute, not for a long time.
So if your kid is naked and you're giving him iPad, he won't be hungry anymore, but he's not learning how to get off or lead himself, said Professor Fenske.
And, "This other management will be moved from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child's not only learning how to be disappointed, but gets more self-controlled in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the noise.
But we don't have to be too critical.
Our goal should almost feel agreed when we are from the achievement of a constant disruption of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We commit her from the need to weaken more, but the nudity is painful, unclean to be connected to something mental," said.
What people really look for, he said, is the way to leave and use free time.
"In the middle where we are still impressed," he said, "it's hard to find ways to be disappointed when the ghost is shutting."
No manufacturer in Colorado relating to the new law on marihuana
The 19th-year-year-year-old Anthony Orosco, student at the highest high-school and photobac from South-East Colorada, has been accused of criminal acts for something that will be quickly in the whole state - for a number of marihuana grams and drums he used for her trial.
Mr. Orosco said that a close day went with a few friends in Lamar, on the plans of the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police found in the marihuan car, Mr. Orosco was invited to prevent drugs and exploitation to use the drugs - detailed crimes in which they are for 100 USD - and the date of judgment was appointed to him.
"They were hiding us as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
In the past weeks after the colored voting on the legalization of small marihuanas for rereading use, the responsibility of hundreds of small drug cases are nearly in place than on law.
The centuries of crimes for the marihuana detention has already been interrupted here and in Washington, which has approved the similar measures.
The police department has stopped committing adults in 21 years and elders to carry up a small quantity which will be legally authorised after the law in the past weeks will enter into force.
But the prisoners in the concertive areas of Colorada announced that they continue to continue with existing cases relating to marihuanas, and are still accused of people for distress.
Currently, a number of cities from Denver's subject to the west mountains votes on the protection of the opening of new, the State of licenced trades with marihuana in their areas.
"This case is so quick that I don't know what happens," said Daniel J. Oates, a police officer in Aurora, east from Denver.
The heads of the threat and regulators in Washington.
And they seek the proposal to set up the licence system for shipping, production, distribution and selling - all in terms 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, in good or evil, is before most States in marihuana regulation, first for medical use, and now also recreational.
"Colorado has more regulatory market, so he will be a good leader," said Brian E. Smith, speaking advice for the license for the sale of the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith allowed, no place or system can be done more than suggesting what could work.
"There's no real presidence that we're going to go," said he.
The Washington law, e.g. I-502, has the efficiency of 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum in which there is no State license system, but legal disorder yes.
And there are some mechanical questions that should be resolved during this period, for example, to consider the State Directive relating to the "associated access" to the licenced marihuana with its trade law to 330 metres from school, parks, children's ship or children's centres.
"No one will be more difficult to locate the licensed trade with convention than in the cities, especially in the metropolitic areas of Seattlu," said Ben Livingston, speaking center for legal conories, recently based on research groups.
On November 21, the police officer Oates sent from Aurora to his members of the e-mail, in which the city's prisoner will no longer exceed the permissions for a small number of marihuanas in each age of 21 years and that the police will stop the accusation of people for these crimes.
Leader Oates said that the police will provide a citizen law for the regular party of the medicine marihuana and that he will continue to steal drug overseers and dealers.
Welld in the north Colorado, a Ken Buck periodic browser represents a better view.
After the vote, he announced that his office will continue in the absence of the cases of marihuana treatment, mostly as a way to press the user to look for the treatment.
In the present time, the accusation of 56 grams or less marihuana 119 people, even though many of them are more accusations.
"Our office is obliged to shoot the criminal offence that was criminal acts during the time he came to them," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places, such as the extern period of Messa, where the electorers refused the marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of a period, has no longer committed to a small number.
The periodic interpreter, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to ensure all the cases concerned.
"I don't think I'm losing my time to continue to exercise the law until it's changed," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the coloured choices have been supported, the introduction of the recreation marihuana to the governor and law system will never be easy.
And the contradiction reactions, for instance, the State was declined with regard to this large Green Experience of the deep distribution between local officers.
For the periodical procurators, it's "culture barryer", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, who has been committed by the marihuana treatment, and the local speaker of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on Marihuana.
"It's a big part of their lives with a lot of people that they can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states that are made to the small number of marihuanas as alcohol are Colorado and Washington on the best path of national test cases for legalization of drugs.
The officers and the State authorities plan new limits for legalized selling and currently expect awareness of the federal government, which is still in the plan to assess the sale and increase marihuana for federal crimes.
Marhuana's legalization officers hope that the Ministry of Justice will be made free.
Moreover, through a number of marihuana soldiers for medical purposes and patients who use it, which have been taken attention, have left the major federal government of trades with medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 States in carrying.
While the antidroga agents may not have been carried out the door to cover a small drop with drugs, it is probable that they may be able to ensure that the State of regulated trades with the recreation of the new laws allowed by marihuana, Kevin A. Sabet, an elderly adviser in the area of anticipation policy of the President Obama.
Some colored cities are not expected to proceed federal authorities.
Before the election day, some local governments have approved moratoires on any new trade with marihuana, even though it will remain a year before any business can be opened.
The last week of the city of Montrose on the west of the State has been proposed by a half-year command and is likely that the next week will enter into enhancement.
"We don't want to feel in the situation when we give a person a licence and then we'll have a great federal interest," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the town Council.
Our neighbor voted against this plugin.
We're looking at what she voted, against what he said.
There's really a lot of questions here.
Peteronella Wyatt, "I was taken to go out of Oxford because I'm a conservative."
They are not just universe students today at their views.
I don't remember that I'd never mind the studio in Oxford.
Like my father, my elder brother studied the university that I thought he was the largest world's science, modern Greek symptom motivated two civilization pilars, free thoughts and tolerance.
And then, at the end of the 80th century, I was going to go to the first scenario of my life, and I came to the first scenario of my life.
My father was hungry and wept.
My friends were crazy.
The Journal Evening Standard stated that I gave it, because I had a motive to love students in the nearby room.
The writer A.N. Wilson declared a loud statement that I went out because I was naked to drink from the rolled branches.
The truth was less complicated.
I've escaped.
Yeah, I've lost because I was the subject of systematical scanning and fear.
Not because of my American name or reality I came from the private school.
I was followed by the only reason, and in this honourable glass, it was like a barbarian: my father, who was raised Woodrow Wyatt, was a high positioned counsel of Margaret Thatcher and I as the Concert Party.
You can ask why I'm talking about it until now.
It is just because the last reports indicate that the new generation of students from the middle of the middle of the same persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hate of concert students in Oxford is so big that the last week of these students had the same protection of equal rights as gays, persons with health and ethnic minors.
Conservative members of younger (JCR) on Corpus Christi College says that because of their political opinions they are "timely actively isolated, designed to personal attacks and is given to them that they are not welcome."
They request to create a position in the Universal Committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their opinions may be free.
Their situation has not helped the recently mentioned documentary order of BBC Two with the name Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Agriculture: young, smart and right) about a student's political division, which conservatively expressed as a spectacular and non-onicist.
In order, Joe Cooke, an old President Oxford University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Oxford University - OUCA), who led Rolls-Roycem, was clothed in silver clothes and had a silver head.
In other high schools, the concert students say that it's with them because of the high school's introduction comes as "of the victims."
20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association of Nottingham University), said to the nearly news that "left influence on universities grows.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club, and they don't come with us."
One-year-year-old student of historical history on Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands for a greater protection, says that such climates are "increasing", while the 19th-year-old president OUCA Stephanie Cherill said that in the access of JCR members of the people from the middle of the middle.
"This represents a threat for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the good living conditions of members," says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was smaller than one member.
I arrived in September 1986, 18 years old, and incredible way.
Hate against the Concert Side was the most horrible.
A year ago, the University refused to reject a honourable title of ancient student Margaret Thatcher because of the clusters in high school financing.
With the atmosphere, the stalinists will also be afraid.
During the first few days of the week, when the new students are involved between themselves and the professors, I was able to build a piece that had to come.
I realized that the professors are not only approved to obtaining conservative requests, but with the poverty they also participate in him.
In the tree of obedience, the hornical policy, privatization and resistance of governments was brought to the tree of holidays in the South African Republic.
My first proposal was intended to translate the French text from the 18th century to English and I was not prepared for the following.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "come for the first paragraph."
I've got a lot of shoes.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face as a smoke, was a lot of yellow.
"Thatcherovs refused to learn French, or are they just stupid?"
Other students have gone.
I'm in the eyes of the slides.
"I'm suggesting you at your free time to take some French basic lessons, so if you're not too occupied by the Community's issues," advised Professor Pitt.
I've come back to my room.
I was sitting alone at school at evening, when I felt easy shopping on the ramen.
He was a second student named James, who was a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said.
It's crazy.
Everyone who is surprised of the concerts is dead.
It's too bad for me, but they know that your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the concertive elements suggest that they are labourists.
Later in the local office, I tried to prevent.
I thought I wouldn't agree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick appeared to be unfortunate.
Student of the first year's philosophy, political and economy who (which iron) went to Eton, said, "You're a fascist daughter."
You're laughing.
Other students noticed him.
I've been rebelled, spin.
"How do the concerts love?" asked one.
They're young to each other, right?
I felt like they had to feel homosexual before liberal legislation since 60 years.
Can I ever get the normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been worthy to meet with people like those who think about me only after meeting?
I'd have to change in the labour and get my natural balls?
Three years before me were developed as a pure ignoration and isolation.
The only open concert professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who sitted on my faculty.
He was hated not only because he was concerted, but also because he was the advice of Margaret Thatcher for the foreign policy and one of those who write her words.
He wasn't there.
This place has hated for his provincies and malerity and for his accommodation to marrisco-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he went to a professor in the Bilkent University in Turkish Ankara.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started going from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for a bunch in my unbelievable metropolitic friends and families.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
In his studies in Oxford forty years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," said pathically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the town of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His wonderful eyes were suffering.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just shit.
If you'd go away, I'd worry about my heart.
My citizen department was worse in London with a frequency of fresh expenditure.
My friend, also the concert of the Concert Party, cut down the press and turned up his conviction.
The next week in the process of education, when another teacher of his story in a serious sure he told me I was an enemy of people, I decided to do so.
Although I was red in my studio, I agreed that "the mothers have broken my brain" and I called them "the old fools."
The bottom was just a short code.
My father's carrier in the front of my oxford carrier.
At that time he wrote two columns every week in Murdoch's news.
My doors were closed.
I ran inside, and after five minutes my persecutors left it.
When they went, I cut off the coffee and took the first floor to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead stress.
However, no 18-year girl or boy should be in the education of such a threat of fear and emotion.
However, more tragic is that it was Oxford, not only 14 concert premises, but that also hides in this day for unserved news of places with equality and freedom of thoughts.
"Valentino has more elegant than honor."
For the opportunity of the "Valentino: Master of Modem Creators", which was started this week in London, ABC with Naty Abascalo, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiss and other glorious Italian Representatives.
Somerset House, ancient restaurant Isabelly I. English, is the only place in the British main city to host Valentina Garavani.
The representative confirmed this when starting the "Valentino: Master of models", which represents more than 130 highly models of its athletes created for the last 50 years.
"I'm built this cluster," says his unchangeable Italian advice.
This expenditure is the conclusion of the story in which "He Mr" is the only Protagonist, which could not be written without his respective client.
Valentino always felt the ransom and remote world of the aristocracy.
The first room of the exhibition, which is achieved until 3 March, overcomes private corresponsibilities and photographs with the most significant signs of Snowdon, from the Princess Salim Aga Chan through the Greek Princess Marii-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino makes these personal reminders as the triff of his society assembly: from a simple town of Voghera in the northern Italy to an idol of international "boom smith".
I like King's family is nothing wrong.
"They're at least a cygaret smoke in a great copper, as do some beautiful pop-music celebrity," says the baron Fiona Thysen-Bornemis.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in Alpa, and we were good friends.
Valentino is a professional hostial and hosts are busy and with elegance.
"All of us was very happy when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains the exmanent "Heiniho" Thysen and the near friendship forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugene Niarchos.
"Valentino always liked elegant than honor.
And it's a star of him."
Valeria Mazzova preview Valentina
The charism of the proposer doesn't forget the argentin model Valeria Mazzova.
"It's a lot of years that we've been looking at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to go to him for a evening.
We were 20 and between us was Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his holiday, eating, music, he turned into all things and felt his spirit.
All invitations could feel important and loving," remembers the top model that began working with him in the past of Paris’s week-second mode in 1995.
"He's never out of the way, because his proposals are a single work," he ends.
Providence of birth
Gravity's life is not a story of inhabitants, but actually restored loves.
He loves people with good training and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was stopped on a person at seventy meters of long passage that offers a role exchange: a visitor is changed in the model, and is going to observe the "obbecenst" dreams that have a Valentian mysterious work as raiment that chose Jackie Kennedy for his room's saint Aristotelem Onessis, who had the Monica Vitti in the "Noth" or the cabbage that looked for the Farao Diba.
In the public, the names such as Sibilla Lucembursk, Gloria from Thurna and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norsk, Rosario Bulharski or Sophie Habsbursk.
Naty Abascal and proposer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "not forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were calhots, kids, gillettes and sacks from back-zim collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the proposals museum.
"I'm giving him before others for his wife and great love to women because he's understood our beauty," adds the old officer of Feria.
"More I like the colors that he uses, they're very clear and give the face "shirt".
The proportions are perfect."
No princess and modem icons Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how Valentina first clothed.
When she came and lived in Italy, she wanted to be filled and had the opportunity of clothing one of his evening clothes...
Finally, she was waiting for the end of the 90s.
"My first clothes from Valentine I bought for the opportunity to celebrate my brothership, prince Edouard de Ligne.
They were red clothes that had smokes with volunteers, a big food and a smoke without a railway.
It was a dream that became real," says the widow after Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to the way, his courage is overtime," explains the Italian aristocrat, which lives belonging to Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg has stored the proposal of the celebration shadows "beautiful... because the clothes are not only clothes, it's also a file of reminders that have in themselves."
"King" mode
The golden branches of the building in Somerset House are the satellite garments of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
For the creation of these hot clothes of slonobin colors with all perlames, twelve types of different countries and the length of four and half meters were required for four months of work and 25 "hole" (as the name of the property of its slides).
According to the newspapers of Suzy Menkes, the largest authorities of the specialised pressure, these shadows represent the border of the top mode of the end of the 20th century, "Return client from the high company".
Valentino raised in the years of elitarian "saver-se" is now his best example.
Garvani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest statement in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and the named series of the Host Legis describes much cost as any of his husbands.
"My attention has always applied his choice, calm, corrected and perfect look," recognizes Princess D'Arenberg.
"The last month I saw him on the gal in the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Jacqueline de Ribes, my big friend.
He was unfair, he didn't leave any steps on him."
When the princess says...
The most serious dream in the world: the ports of the ships in the Cawah Ien
Four euros are driving in the area of Indian soaps with their life and health when they driving 70 kilometers down by smooth roads.
They are people for which their work is hell, and they are like those who work perfectly in hell.
This is the case of Anta Weayi, one of the 400 horses who are in the lives of the Cawah I's soap of Kawah I's on the east of the Indian Island Java.
For this reason, each day of fat until the day of a curriculum, where the serious flowers are disappeared from the ground, and when the air is connected, it goes to a certain state.
After that, the large locks of the seeds that are at 70 kilos, the branches of the two buses are raised on the roads of two buses on the bottom roads.
At the top of the supply 2 386 meters, it's only 250 meters, but it's about 40 minutes before it comes to the wind temperature up, because they keep the equation and are exactly considering their steps that they don't destroy and don't get into the propaganda.
They know that any challenge could stay in life as one French tourist who was raised from Kawah Ijin's road for years ago.
The tops in Kawah Ien are built five cents for each kilos of the ships
When they are up, the way around tourists who are photographing them, as if they are oxygen in the circle, and they are soon raising hard ships to the ship that the worthy company has put on something low, in the oversee height of 1850 meters.
It is one of the PT Candi Ngrimbi company, which is in the supply since 1960 and never paid his workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (5 cents) for kilos of seed.
Then he sells it for 100,000 rupies (83 cents) to the petrochemic industry, because this disease has its place in each day and is used for production of hair, amusing pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dinamity and even to white sugar.
"It's why it usually takes 70 kilos, we'll make about 46,000 rupes (3,8 euros) every way," explains Anto, which usually solves three ways day.
One path remains three hours and at the end is destroyed, but it can make 138 000 rupes (11,5 €) a day.
Although it's like an increasing amount for such a small effort, it's the triangle of what he's doing on the field.
"The day of the top is very high here. For example, for the collection of the coffee is paid 15 000 rupes (1,2 €) for the day and pay for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 €)," explains the notice that worked on the Turist Island Balli as a town.
There was 75,000 rupes (6,2 €) for the day and work, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, the ice near the supply, because of a serious reason that is in Indonesia, the same convinced as a sire: "I married with a young girl from Bali, who is Indian, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has astma, he's worried, he's still respirating, and his eyes have toxic flowers.
In his 27 years Anto risks life three times a day in the Cawah Ijen sop, which has already been able to choose his money, although he has his face protected special mass and brakes.
He's astma, he's wrongly respirating, still a hair, and his eyes have tough toxic flowers that are out of the socks.
That's the price that you need to pay for to get his dream.
"I'll work for more than two years because I want to open the business or study the Spanish or French," he promises more than the indigenous English.
This sympatic and intelligent younger could be a tourist leader, a number or a recipe in the hotel, and instead of the work of the neighbor work.
Parts the branch tree with other naziers and every day rises in two hours morning, because the skin doesn't break out in the night and its characteristic yellow color is changed in blue and in the week of darkness.
And through the shadow of the darkness, Anto's in the shorter, and lights the way of a little light, which has been attached to the helm and sold it for its money.
At least 400 neighbors exceed on the sheet of the sheet of the sheet from a short day
Although the company has a higher accommodation, the difficulty of the resources has not been limited by the support of costs, and does not provide the loaders who work on their own growth and with such efforts, no rescue.
In fact, no part of 30 000 rupies (2,5 euros) from an adjoint for photographing, which is with the input of 15 000 rupies (1,2 eur), choose a natural park from tourists who are coming to photograph the soap and its human mules.
"This work is for a lot, and not for people," Madrusin, a 42-year-old room, worked in Kawah I'm three-year-year-old, since he left schools.
He can take up to 110 kilos and ensure us that he keeps working, "How far it's going," because he needs money for education of his three sons between 18 and 10 years.
I'm not going to go back, I'm going to die here because the shoe was my whole life.
Although the wind blows the horse and the smoke in the eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and smokes the horses in the horses that are out of the shoes, the tops are so sure that no one is hard to suffer serious diseases... but it is obviously of their fresh respiratory difficulties, arts, pains of cold and crash on the border of your bodies.
Oneinik, who raises his slot on the back, can only put 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues produce in 15 tons of cycles, and then three stones carried out the stream of the stream between the woods to the busy in Tamansari, 18 miles away.
"I'm not going to the east, I'm going to die here, because the supply was all my life," says Oneinik and then opens the shield of the mouth in which some dogs are missing.
From his five sons he's the oldest, thirty years old, he also makes the ships.
The time is plot, but the established battle of one of the most difficult rules in the world survives from generation to generation - rumes, which execute human mules in Kawah Ilen.

Singapurs claim that they have no children, carrier, stres, and costs for living and education.
"Singapura's residence needs growth."
I'm married, and I'm a owner, you're my wife, and you're a lady.
It may appear incredible that this slogan is part of the reklame of mental bombons, but even - or maybe just so - with a video in the beginning of this year in Singapur has been expanded on YouTube.
These winds are part of the rape that uses the local shoes of the type "we'll give a bullshit in the bulls" as the extent of birth in Singapore.
The BBH reporting agent who created the video will hope that this reklame will be given to them to warn the problem in a funny way.
The officer of Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use music influence to fulfill the "the citizen's obligation."
"It's explicitly about the Internet's interest, so it was to be funny and funny.
It's the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had to feel that it's the subject we need to touch.
We knew that the government tried many things as to expand parfums with farms, or to organize listing birds.
Many of these ideas could be created, but not very functional.
So we thought we didn't do this most creative thing, as it's the rape to resolve this problem."
1,2 Children
He who doesn't make it a lot of worms is a singapuraus government.
Annually, 1 300 USD is designed to encourage citizens to have more children.
Government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 for the child, provides maternal allowance and adds financial doses.
All these measures had a small effect.
Singapur is a rich city State with a growing technological technology in South Asia, also known as its representatives and social controls.
Birthday rate in Singapore on the development of citizens is currently 1,2 children for women.
Finally, the rate of born value 2, which was considered to be renewed in 1976.
Why do the Singapurs have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and the family of the National Agency for Civility says that it is because of "best education" and "the larger carrier opportunities."
"The people have a larger scale of possibility, if it is about life targets and priorities, it's not only wedding and family," explains.
These changes in society standards have contributed to increase the number of freedoms and to decrease the marriage and children. The result is reducing the rate of birth in Singapore.
While the immigration policies have been tried to dramatically increase the migrants as measures against the number of citizens, it was called a disagreement among the local citizens.
On some of the singapur web sites, you can see uncovered xenofobia against many new assistants, especially Chinese, criticised to maintain low payments and small trying to integrate.
The increase of the immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the government side of Singapur has recorded his worst choice result from the beginning of independence.
After choices, the problem was attempted to resolve through the quantity and higher contributions for the frontier workers.
Unexpected results
While the age of birth has known impacts on national economic growth, money receives, costs in health and immigration policy, there have been certain unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government's trying to make a lot of small houses.
For example, she began to influence trades with inability.
The Office for City Development has started to regulate the number of small lives known as the "club from boat" which can be established in certain cities.
These lives have 46 meters of fourth and had great success in sale.
However, it is afraid that these villages can support young life style and turn developers to establish a large family house.
But Lim Yew Soon, the general director of the developer company EL Developers, says that their "clubs from the boat" are selling faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and so they're sold for days to weeks faster than houses with greater dinner.
That's why they're much better for our money."
However, it suggests that new standards make clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Extreme extreme
Singapur is a city.
Although this new rules could be guided to increase the peace of the birth of the nation, the talk with the Singapurians working in the financial quarter in the center of the city indicates that they will not have a great effect.
"The people are still in the stress, houses are dear, like education, so many people are disappointed," says the young officer.
"The others have children.
But it's important for me to pay for your own money and time," says another, like twenty-year-old, young.
Mans and women mix carrier, stress and costs for life and education as reasons for children.
So if the government is trying to be able to take children, they are the same end of the Singapurians who have the last word for the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to the Dictionary of the Kingdom of Spanish Academy, there is something that has personal consideration or "the property of private life which every law has to protect against any destruction."
What is this private for a 16-year-old man?
How does this definition apply in its day life and social networks?
Do you understand the danger that it is issued when it publishes the issues that would certainly not tell anyone in a regular communication?
The newspapers from El Periodico spoke five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years, who are often users of the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the privacy of the "the whole thing of its own" in the personal round and the "username and password" if it was involved on social network.
"My biggest secret I wouldn't publish," says the decade of Jorge, in order to explain the significance of private in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where the accounts have been two years ago.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," says he.
"I'm giving good photos or photos as we play.
I'm talking to those who know.
I wouldn't share a photo that wouldn't be mine, or a photo that would be funny to someone," says.
This boy knows that it's bad to publish spectacular photos, photos of the persons or photos of crimes, or write low or grievous comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends who have FB and his nine friends on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
It's between them and the mother who has the name and the password of one of the accounts.
"I've made a Twitter account so I can express my opinions and write interesting articles.
I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just giving them there.
"Social networks are funny, I can talk to friends who are far away or quickly to communicate with friends," says.
Unfortunately he says he would never receive a request from the unknown person.
It wouldn't be careful if someone recommended him a unknown person.
The event of Joseph's fourteenth year is different.
This teenager own accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and on the last mixed network suggests that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of that because we have something common, for example, music," he says.
According to this boy, no one of them didn't put him on anything, nor he wanted a address or a phone number after him.
"If they'd take me or ask me, it's easier to remove it from their account," he agrees.
Joseph contacted Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
Tomuto boys are not a strange experience with what is called cyberbullying today.
"The known friends have split on social networks.
They ran him out and asked money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
The victim wasn't exchanged by Joseph's account.
"It's just a privacy mode."
Then he explains the series of steps to set the account safe.
At the difference of Jorge, this boy would publish photos known in unbelievable or trained situations.
"Obviously, I would have done that if someone had been looking for me or would just want me.
Even if I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, the English teacher and the Advocate of the Education and Training Affairs, has to make children and access in social networks directly orientated, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to be informed.
It indicates that "Internet has become a means to search for information, but when the social network has appeared, the game rules have changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic employer Marc Prensky, a pedagogic solvent on the University of Yale and the author of the Digital Works and digital accommodation, has brought these ideas to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital households are children and young people who were born during this technologie.
We are digital accusers that we have to teach them, and then we're learning ourselves right now," says.
He explains that it's about the basic subject, "Why do we ask them to find what it's appropriate to publish, publish, and say, and whatever it's not, in the future, when they're not struggling on it."
And to be - what's about around - disagreement, in time when the most likes is to be favored, having thousands of friends and not thinking about the results," adds.
According to this specialists, it is the most efficient way of showing what is the private, the setting of questions that are able to think.
"To tell them that they don't do anything, it doesn't work," adds.
Next Marrielos Porras calls some of the possibilities: There are things you should not tell a stranger, so why are you doing that on the Internet?
Or, would you like if someone opened your photo, as you opened the friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When you marked people on photographs from the famous, did you ask these people to release?
And another one, they need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to be kept in the Internet as well as outside him.
They're the same rules.
"A man besides the Internet leads respect, moral and other principles, and it should be on social networks," says.
View
Stuardo Guardia, Universal Professor, teacher on the first grade and education adviser explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules of social networks.
"If it understands every reason, they have a good basis to talk to children about the results that can have a account on the Internet.
For example, what is about the age or what is allowed to share or publish," says.
Guardia is the opinion that it's the key to remind the traditional rule of children "not talk to strangers."
Summary of South America ends and Report of Lima was not published
The sixth president summit of the Union of South American nations (Unasur), held today in Peru, has not been published by the Proverbs of Lima, which was published and signed at the end of the seven present Presidents.
Agency Efe has tried to reach the access to the document signed on the sixth meeting of the State heads and the Government of the Unsur, but the officers of the frontier and the president officers, which, at the beginning, concluded that the public document after the conclusion of the summit, would be published later on the Peruan government websites.
They further stated that the content was published by the Peruan President Ollant Humalou in several short print statements.
The newspapers had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the operation, the video was transmitted from the President meeting without sound report with the "Confidential meeting, the sound transfer is limited."
A small number of information that had available newspapers was provided to some governments who had been acting in the future, but not peruan speakers.
The only document published during the operation was a list of participants with the President, which was not called hundreds of newspapers from various national and international media requesting more information.
Afterward, the Peruan President's media office has been sent by the e-mail to the "confirm statement" with the summit, but it is only on the explanation of the President Humaly, and not on the official document that has closed the summit.
The last hosting hosted Peru the third summit of South America and Arab countries (America del Sur-Arabes, ASPA) and even in this opportunity, it was not published originally by the Promised Proverbs from Limy, even though it was required to print horly.
On official pages ASPA can be found that the document was published recently.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities ensures to ensure that all newspapers were sended, but they were completely dismissed.
The Sumit concluded other common obligations by Chile and Peru to adopt the Haag Court of Justice, which solve the training of border between both countries.
President Peru Ollanta Humala and President Chile Sebastian Pinera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in Haag, which at the lunch begins to hear the defense of the two parties to provoke the sports that started against Lima.
"We will welcome and execute the judgment that will resolve the sports that we are now in this International Court," said President Humala together with his chile-prosecutor.
"Chile was, and it would be a country respecting international law, peacekeeping of sports, agreements and international courts," fulfilled Piner and healed President Humalu's stakehand in the field of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Columbia adopted this week the Bogogue Pacte, which expressed the detail of the International Court of Justice, which decided on maritime borders with Nikaragua, and Colombia considered that it was very wrong.
Summit was channeled without participating Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolívia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christine Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the organisation of Unsur in 2011 after the revoking of the President Fernanda Luga, and the meeting was not participated.
The Hospital President Ollanta Humala was confirmed by the start of early words and the end of the summit in Lima shortly afternoon.
The President read a final document in which he informed that the Agreement was adopted 16 and was planned for 31 projects between South America, with investments in 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the adopted agreement, the UNASUR organization would "the important steps to address the objective in the form of the South America citizenship which has been expanded by the residence agreements."
He informed that the actions are supported to improve the "population in fight against civil immorality and international organizated crime, to better accessibility of medicines and low internet in all Coasts of South America and to common and effective measures against the risks of natural catastrophes".
When Europe is in crisis, "no economic consolidation (Latian America) is a victory basis, but he has to serve to expand our productives and to show our nations better future," added Humala.
"We decided to establish a group of 31 symbolic projects, which better transport connection of various locations in South America, especially foreign and regions... to make our country better connected and create new economic provisions," said the Peruan President.
He noted that five of these projects were concerned with Peru and its grounds from the border to Brazil, and two other two are the better connection with Ecuador, but he did not have more details.
The closed document also took the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves her return to the South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the matters that he raised up was needed to remain Latin America still prosperous and peaceful areas, which is fully and has a good sovereign relationship.
In this meaning, the Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation on the regional meeting, that he hopes that he will meet his Nikaragujian Prosecutor Daniel Ortego, in order to respect the decision of the International Court of Justice on the sport of the sea border, which is obvious to the Bogote.
"I'm supposed to meet President Daniel Ortegou tomorrow (in the Sabbath)," said Santos.
"We will make all the solutions, there is no agreement with Nikaragua, which would require action with this country," he replied.
"I hope I'll be able to say to the President Orthodox to lead actions to the most civilised and invisible form," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega are meeting on the Sunday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the inauguration of the president of Enric Peñi Nety.
In the context of the summary, the Ministry of the Union was forwarded to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which encourages the dialogue and consensus to the protection of the area.
UNASUR organization members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Equador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay, although the last country is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America needs to learn integration from Europe
The Equador President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "the South America, in this case, must be learned from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth president of the South American Union of the nations in Lima, published in the State TV Peru, that the Europeans "see murdered for 2 World Wars" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one own."
In this meaning, a draft creation of South America's citizenship that supports the Member States of the Union's organization.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any south-American country that is already traveling between the Indian Community, but there are still reiterative areas that want us to return to the past," advertised.
In addition, the Ecuador President declared that it agreed to the overseer of the United States (OAS), under the conditions that the influence of the English States will be reduced and to take into account those who signed Pakt from San José on human rights.
"They who are in the road, they never advise anything, and we are the South Americans, even though we are signing everything.
It is impossible that the Interamerical Commission for Human Rights is financed in Washington, "with a political asylum offered by the Ecuador, the WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that this decision would not be grateful because he didn't raise his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He fulfilled that in that time, "It was a reasonable surprise that Assange could be delivered to the third country without regard to the executive process."
Furthermore, the Swedish Justice which requested him to make a question on the Swedish territory for a given sexual decline, as well as "the own Swedish legislation allows to implement the results of the video conference talk that could be applied to the equatorial majority in London".
Correa showed that there is a risk that Assange's physical and psychic health will be reduced.
"I wasn't talking to him since a minute that's on our grand-shirt, but she informed me that he had a detailed fish difficulty, but nothing serious," she said the equatorial head of the state.
"But it's bad that his physical and psychic state is worse, because it's closed on a small space without the possibility of move on a clean air.
It would be known to everybody's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution of asylum offered to Assine from June on the Equador Greenland in London on the basis of the authorisation that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hand of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, and indicated that the talks with London were made for the conclusion of the WikiLeaks based on.
"We don't solve the human rights, but we don't use such words in this case, but we have still been talking.
The resolution of this problem is in the hand of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Courts, because the lawyer of Assange of Baltazar Garzon leads a series of rules in various European institutions," he mentioned.
He said, "If the British's getting a ransom tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Sweden will listen to the Ecuador Greatness in London or over Skype, how it allows the local legislation and how it has already been done in other cases, it will be done tomorrow to the end of this problem."
Correa used this situation to represent himself as an opposition of the freedom of pressure, and explained that it was decisively not tolerate "depth, bad ideas and lies that cope the freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of free pressure are not us, under and overwhelming the policy, but the bad newspapers in the services of ice, the smokes and the shoes," he said.
In this view he declared the joy of that neither such newspapers, "no bankers, nor hegemon land, nor burgers can control Equador," and said, "If it is chosen again, it will continue to continue in changes of guidance and right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain this stated Paraguay on the membership in the Union of Onesur at least in its next choices and argumented that the objective must be "determined and not tolerate the opportunity and the pumpism of legality" because in fact "the legitimity of the paraguay democracy."
In addition, the Ecuador President said that he considered "to the entirely appropriate" of his Columbia's frontier Juana Manuela Santos to discuss Nikaragua on the sea borders between both countries now, after the Court of International Court in Haag, who decided in Nikaragua's efforts.
The jurisdiction is not accepted at the moment.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are unnecessary but must be convinced by the will of joining together.
It's supposed to judge them to be convinced and it's the possibility to go forward."
In addition, he expressed the hope in comparison with the sea border, which decided in the Court of Peru and Chile, and explained that "It is right for Latin America to look for international instances if both lands are committed to accept the judgment, so that it may be as hard."
In conformity with the possibility that he will consist in the next President's choices in Ecuador to go in the order of the third mandate, he noted that this option is "the great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa announced that if the elections are perished in the 2013 year, he will go out of the public life.
"My personally has never been interested in power, but the wrong situation as social economic poverty in Ecuador can be reformed only by political power.
My political urgent believed that I am the one who rejects this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last president's time and then I would go out of the policy.
When we're playing, it's waiting for me alone.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of President Huga Chaveze in Kuba.
"I just talked to the Vice-President Nicholas Madur, who says that President Chavez went to a planned rutin treatment and his return to Kuba was expected after the campaign end.
The president's health situation is not a reputation," he explained.
The head of the Ecuador State has now participated in the sixth summit of the State's head and the Government of the South American nations (Unasur), which has been concluded by calls to greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the results of late diagnosis today
Fabric was 21 years when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like he'd throw up the skin to me," says he at recalls on the moment of the truth that the doctor tried to be a threat, but obviously without success.
The boy secreted it before the family.
He decided to take his sick to herself, and he began to inform her, and it was with such a statement that he had already glorified the 43th birthday.
It is unfortunately one of the recent patients of HIV units in the Civil hospital in Guadalajar (HCG) who came in 1994 after several diseases.
The manufacturer lives with a virus of human immunodeficience (HIV) since 22 years, which was something unpresentable at the beginning of 90 years when there was a lot of doubts, a few possibilities of treatment and more stigma.
Then no director of the clinical Institute of the Social Security (IMSS) did not declare, "the reason that he had a ransom."
Then AIDS was synonymous of death.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live completely.
However, there are many people who don't know of their disease and are coming until the virus caused the deficit of the body and sent the immune system, and then are victims of appropriate infections.
31 years since the disease has occurred in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "the great success is that the length of the patient, which begins in time and appropriate way to be treated, is totally the same as the healthy people," Jaime Andrade Villanue, leadership of HIV in the Civil hospital in Guadalair, with that this information was confirmed in the duration of the least leading year of the publication.
Infectlog and specialists on HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanuea explained that scientists have come to conclude that AIDS is not a cause of death since 2008, but that the length of survival and full life is concerned with the immunitary system of patients who are diagnosed, and they are better on those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 and 50 years.
It is also stated that the HIV diagnosised in 25 years can say, "for the treatment of treatment to live without problems until 75 years", explained in the talk of the doctor.
To enhance this progress, it is appropriate to remember that the average length of the Mexicans is today 76 years.
Although death in the last years was significantly reduced and, in the case of Mexico, the number of persons died in AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (year of the United Nations Common Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have been disappeared from the reveal of AIDS.
Only in Jalisco, 255 persons died in 2011 and in May 187. However, since 2005, the universal access to anti-retro-roots is assured.
- Why are people still died in the consequences of the disease?
- "I think the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see, so it's going to happen with us in the hospital.
At least the past 12 years, we didn't take care of the medicine, and the problem is that patients are coming in a very progressive stage because they don't know the state of indications or the late disease."
It adds a clear data: "The nine of the ten patients comes when there are already some associated infections. The only thing that we need to do is to be more influenced in all deaths is to diagnose before, and it is therefore necessary to carry tests to all the patients who ask about them."
In its proposal, the Specialists and Officers of the State Council for prevention of AIDS in Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabric, who came to make tests in a private laboratory only because of his friends, and in his nearly age, AIDS had already disappeared and also patienced by Kaposi sarcom, a sustainable disease that was one of the common complications.
"It's gonna be changed when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'll make three times a week," they say, "but it's not my case.
It was changed to better, healthy, singing, drinking the medicine."
His parents knows only that he suffered a kid.
"I live normal life as everyone.
I work, I have a lot of active action, ways, leaders of sexual life, but responsiblely, I take attention to myself and to another person," called Fabrio, who accepted an explanation to share his experience with the MILINO JALISCO journal, that he caused his witnesses today in the World Day of AIDS.
"If they risk, let them know what the HIV is positive, it's better, and if they're already diagnosed, let them know that they can live as anyone else if they're responsible."
This report has the password of battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms for the board
In the middle of health and regular citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajarian newspaper, which provides information on HIV virus.
And the largest spaces are in prevention.
In the places that are achieved by this task, "the condoms have actually increased, before we have given one or two, they give us packages and hundred condoms, which are very well, but still there are people who do not have access to condoms."
The most vulnerable to the new commands are achieved.
"What do you want?" is a regular question full of iron and raising social workers, school counselers, doctors and health personals who want to go out," says the reporter.
He refused to change this ineffective division, so that the condoms are not only for the pool, but that hundreds of these are in the drugs in public researchers, in the places where you are often walking.
"It's not the support of promisions.
It doesn't matter about them "a payment of drink and motel" as the Governor Emilio González replied to the question if he agreed with the distribution of preservatives in his period.
The best is to access the condoms of those who have already been guided sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
13 435 cases were notified (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This status means the fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% report is a sexual route, 6% blood route and 2% peripherally.
It seems that with HIV virus he can live almost 50 thousand people, because in one recorded case there are four to five persons who do not know about disease.
The jurisdiction approved by the Court of the United States who does not recognize the restructuring of the companies of the Group Vitro established by the competition in Mexico, chooses a poor presence for any national business with poverty in the neighbor country and the problem of solvency.
It seems therefore that the procedures of restructuring by the company that allow measuring laws are not paid in the country of branches and stars within the international agreements.
The approval of the judgment of 15 June of the past year of the Court Harline Halm in the concurrent court for North Texas, leaves mexic companies without preservation against the possibility of confidentiality of their possessions on the second border of the River El Bravo.
However, the Court opens the main Mexico manufacturer the door to the Supreme Court of the United States with calling against three inequality.
The advice is to say that while the judge of this case says that the trusters have to lead to the insolvency law of the United States, the Court of Fifth period with the Seat in New Orleans says that the main procedure is establishing a competitive management in Mexico.
First, it would be shown to unknown international process cooperation in the cases of insolvency of international enterprises.
The model law of the United Nations for the integration of the international trade law was established by this purpose, which a arbitrary defines the organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the Court states that, without voting to the internal business structure, it is recognized for the contribution of the maternity company of Vitro to the pool, it would not be granted to the majority required to apply the restructuring.
However, this option allows measuring laws.
The case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was accepted.
It's half of the entire examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexico, for which the intropoders handed the federal competition institution.
Furthermore, it is true that even after receiving the voices of the postery, believers - who stayed in the Court of Vitro in the United States, including the "sups" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not get the majority.
The vote would be at least 45 per cent to 37.
This advocate judge will not be in the challenge.
In another way of view, Vitro's court has been committed by the difficult situation from 2008 - on the back of a serious economic crisis that has lost in the United States.
In the middle of the family company Gonzálese Sady, the Court of Justice is called to be fulfilled for full participation, therefore, for the participation of five judges, because they were originally voted only three.
If it does not succeed here, it will be required as a correct review of the process higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, the Court has forgotten the document sent by the Mexican Government as a disaster of a friend of curia, in which Vitro's company is detailed in the context of the Concurrency Law, and indicated that the company has encouraging the agreement undertaken by both countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
It also shows that the country has submitted the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for international trade, it is the rules set out for international insolvency cases that include equality for employees and creditors.
Narrow on both sides: Vitro company and State.
Total assessments
Without notification, a few months of criminal report of the Mexican Affairs Department against the Old Leader of Gaston Azcarraga Andradem, which was raised from the undertakings, and, according to the Department's organisation of pilots, has already been transmitted.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The Basketball World Trainer Hector "Hetin" Reyes was with this salary sport more than 60 years and processed throughout the world.
Many people in Portuguese have such a number of memories of the local basketball story, such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before his brain dead in 2008, the brain cross-border, held in this sport over 60 years, to be as a younger category player, a national basketball ligue BSN, a master and trainer of the Vaqueros de Bayamon team in the national basketball list, or the president of Porttorical Basketball Federation.
"I lived in my life in the basketball a lot of role, including sometimes as I was President of the BSN, the General Unit of the National Team and the Federal President," Reyes reminded Reyes at visiting new Primera Hora reporters at home in Bayamon, where he lives more than 50 years ago with his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is in his defense of pregnancy.
The walls of his house, which are almost all obtained photos and reminders of his long carrier, prove.
Bayamon in heart
With the biggest movement of all the guests who remind him of his training in Vaqueros since half of 50 years, where he was player until 1982, when he also glorifyed 15 years as a partner or a team.
"This was my best year, that I used most, because I had the opportunity to participate with the Ross Vaqueros since 1967 to participate eight mysteriousity, to be as a master, a society, or a trainer.
It was a number of successful years, including five championates carried out from 1971 to 1975.
And then I sold a championate - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in the BSN.
Then the team replaced the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a wonderful leader," he said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was a trainer here before and at the Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me, "I've got a weird two-meter player for you.
Do you want him?"
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Porttorico had.
Bartow recommended me by the manager Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shots.
I remember that he said that if Mincy brings Bayamo's winning in the championate, then Gauss will help the next."
Shampionate, when for the Los Vaqueros played Gausse, he was used, but he was just along because in 1988 the President of Basketball Federation had already done the function.
At that time, he wanted to completely feed his functions and use Mincy's location in the national team.
"I remember how we first hit the United States in the qualitative olympian olympian in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world's mystery came in 1990, where we ended fourth, but we had to have a bronze to be the Canadian decision that allowed us to restore the final invasion," said Reyes.
Is man of the world's mystery in 1990 the best national team you ever saw?
It's between the best, like the one who shot Dream Team in Olympia in 2004.
But my favorite was a national team in the Panama's games in Kuba 1991 when we won gold, and we surprised the men of the United States, which was too similar to the one who made us a bronze for the world mystery.
This manship was not only Mincy, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fica Lópeze and Piculina (Ortiz), but there were young people (Javier), "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, brothers of Leonico (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which could not be in the team in 1990 because of the colon destruction.
A man who couldn't have perfect conscience but had made us to win gold medailles and to bring a great joy was a man of the olympian quality in 1995 in Argentina Neuquena.
With players on the board, like "Canito" Neves, Pablo Alice and a junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players exclusively because of the puzzle in Panama's games in Mar de Plata, we have played out of all the prophecies of gold.
What was the best player of Porttorica?
It was without any doubt Picullin Ortiz.
His numbers of international tours are popular.
No one of the Portuguese has obtained such results as Piculin.
Not much about his training in the various lines where he played.
Who was the best portory trainer?
It's very hard.
We had a very good generation in which Julio Toro, Flor Melendingz, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work with young people.
What's your success in the federal thinking of the biggest?
I was part of the greatest national humanitarian office in 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the BSN had a national license in one series to 17 men.
What did you not prove?
There were things I wanted to take, as a separation of young categories according to the regions.
For example, the boys from Ponce would play only in their areas and support teams of other islands only in national play-offs.
Now the children walk a lot of way and play a lot of challenges that doesn't need.
I also see the contribution in the required tests and courts for trainers, decisions and decisions.
I'm happy.
What are you going on now?
Moreover I listen to music, I look at YouTube videos with music from my time, I use new and sometimes go to basketball shops.
And, of course, I use my wife Isabel, who was always after my side.
He died herec Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth in Texas, worldwide offered the main role of John Rosse Ewinga, the most known as "J.R." in the TV series Dallas, in which he shared a man who acted unlikely and was employed and manipulated.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the sweet magnitude J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of lakos in the 80s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned a year as J.R. in the new series Dallas, died according to the official Family report that Agent Associated Press offered the production company of Dallas Warner Bros., on the afternoon on the complication associated with the rabbit.
"Larry returned to his beloved town of Dallas, where he played the iconical role that he had the best," she brought his family.
Larry's family and his neighborest friends with him were in Dallas on the Day of Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in the Dead hospital," she told her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He made the joy of all that he knew.
"He was creative, great, funny, loving, and talented, and I'll be very terrified after it.
He was a single and lived full of his life, "Linda Gray brought out in an announcement.
Hagman's diagnosised the jatern circle in 1992, and he himself recognised that a lot of years was a lot of pill.
In 1995, Hagman found him on the jackets, and Hagman made his transplantation.
A year before sending a series of Dallas Hagman in the TV announced as a famous guy in a separate room I Dream of Jeannie sent NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the position of Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut whose life is changed when he met an attractive girl (Jin) who plays Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
It was also a protagonist in two comedies that were sent shortly, and it was The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His effects in films included a role that was well accepted critical: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was that Hangman's mysterious execution as an incredible J.R., who led him to a star.
The dramatic series of the CBS station on the Ewing club and other persons around them was sent from April 1978 to May 1991.
The Proposal Slogan "Who killed Djaira?" who had been expecting about the part of the full emotion when Hangman's position almost murdered, not only a large number of specializations in the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in the sack officers.
This work also helped to achieve the record in obedience.
The list of the 1980, in which the response was received, was observed in average 41 million television divines, and it became the second most successful story of the MASH series in 1983, which followed 50 million divines.
On J.R., he shoot his weak Christian (which Mary Crosby played).
Kristin and J.R. were smoking, and then he defeated her to sign her as prostitute if she didn't go out of the city, but there were others who had a reason to touch him.
Hagman played Ewinga, an insolent chambiter with a charismatical dream: a famous businessman and a unbelieving husband who tried to be closed to his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcohol.
"I know what I want to have J.R. on the top stone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be there, "There's a honourable residence of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing he didn't.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered at the fifth of Hagman as a person who was "light on the flat and outside him."
It is unforgettable and unchangeable for millions of residents in the world and in the hearts of all of us who had to know him and love him.
Ten parts of the new series Dallas sent the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"It's already completed the packing of five parts of the second line and the sixth was just touched," she reported the TV station.
In directly after Hangman's death, there was no statement available from Warner's company nor from the TNT station on how to continue the series.
The family of Fort Worth in Texas was a son of heritage and sons of Mary Martin, who stood in classic works, such as the South Pacific musicals and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she was born Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the beginning of 50 years, Larry tried to be happy on divadal scenes in New York, and then in 1952 to 1956 he served in England at a airport.
There he knew the young Sweden proposor of May Axelson, who was married.
A couple of men had two children, Preston and Heidi, and a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrits.
In 2001 he delivered the autobiographic book Hello Darlin : Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't do anything about what I knew that someone could hurt or somehow threaten him," said Agent Press Association.
After the transplantation of the jater began to celebrate the propagation of the donation of the authorities and worked as a employer in the hospital where he helped war patients.
"I love them, I'm adding a reputation, I'm going with them when they're going to operate and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a courage in the meaning "Don't worry, it's gonna be a little unbelievable, but you'll be healthy."
He was also a activity in battle against purchase and participated in various campaigns.
It's starting the curses that tests "the end of the world"
Every week students study apocalyptic theme as a nuclear war, zombie, virus and bactery and global explosion.
When the Professor of Religion Stuart Charme decided that this seed would make a curs about the end of the world, he knew that it was an unresolved friend: the end of the "large number" of the May calendar, which has to come on 21 December, has been found as a evidence that the end of the world comes.
But Charme did not know what he expected in some other months: the Catastrophical Uriano Sandy, the budgetary propaganda that some called "Durch Armageddon", and the increased conflict in which Israel is entrusted, where the Christians who are theoretistic about the end of the world begins to Apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most Japanese seed of which it was," said Charme this week to the students of Rutgers University in Camden in New Jersey.
When a man thinks what happens today in the world, like if we remain 30 days, it's really a good time.
And remember that bad means for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers the "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically last in history.
At the University of Temple, the great assistant Barry Vacker's short "Centers, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week students study apocalyptic theme as a nuclear war, zombie, virus and bactery and global explosion.
"We're going to raise why these thoughts are exceeding time," says, "and how they offer hypothetic scenarios that lead to certain human behavior.
For example, if the nuclear material is achieved in the hand of terrorists, the war can be disappeared.
This month students analyze movies with apocalyptic theme and investigate how far they are different from the examples of real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, trustable and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania, Professor Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariova, a good assistant of science and an anthropology to conform a short course with the simple name of the world's simple end.
"We don't connect "2012," because we're always counting with the possibility to reorder the curve in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
In addition to "great destruction" students need to study, create projects and make finished trials.
At Penn State, the final trial will be achieved in Apocalypse preside, which doesn't make students other opportunity to work "to even the end of the world," said Restall.
The pigs became a lot of popular.
"He's gone to two hours," said Restall about his curse for students with a high average of 35.
We got a week and week before the semester's beginning, we got an e-mail question if it's still place.
Samooth students ensure that the course is one of the most interested ones.
"I'll be fascinating to see what people do to please themselves," she said to the Rutgers University in Camden's 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And then apocalyptic, world or religious thinking is only a question of efforts or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and investigation, said he saw all apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard about the hour in which it could be learned," he said.
"I use it."
But no student, therefore, did not say that he believed in the end of 21 December.
"Now our first project was declared about the Mai's proposals and we're going to get it out of a certain way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
"Mays never said the end of the world; it's only the key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he fulfilled that in the West culture there is apocalyptic distress that is gained for a few hundreds of times, which people react to change their environments by the proposals of the end of the world.
The exploitation of these specializations has produced the Internet.
"Then people don't think of it," he said.
It's like that in most of the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a teacher of religion on the University of La Salle, who's leading a year for the Philippines, on the question, if he knows some curse about "the end of the world", he answered quickly.
"The Philippines are the end of the world is independent," wrote and signed the exception in the highest office.
We have mercy from Pape.
Restail noted that during the years he was talking about many days of the last court, and he said, "If nothing happens on December 21, people will start thinking on the next date" or philosophy that 21th prosens is the beginning of the seven-year-old period, at the end of the world will be disappeared.
The date will be able to lie with students and professors.
Some of them said they have to go to the "End of the world."
"I think I'll call some friends to join together," explained a 20-year-old Samira Ford.
