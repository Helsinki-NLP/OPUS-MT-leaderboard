All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he'd be able to do that.
I know that Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep left at the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary says they're lonely.
Did you fear the first time you were on a airplane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There is a large supermarket.
I suspected Tom was disturbed.
I'm sure that Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would've done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure that no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom buyed a lot of memories.
Today's the twentyth of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned on going.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think that Tom knows Mary isn't Canada.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have children.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
I was told that that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is going to continue to get better.
I want someone would help me with that.
Tom definitive knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of themselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should've known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know that you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know that I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.

Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.

Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know that Mary is in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom is concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew that Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought he couldn't have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You will stay here until you are summoned.
My daughter is being tolet trained.
Tom said he didn't think that Mary could've done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good pattern.
I know that Tom is a picky etter and seldom tries anything new.
Tom says he did nothing illegal.
I suspect that Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everybody was late except me.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Tom probably will get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertary.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think that Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he'd be rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should've let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should be talking about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said he thought I might not need to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very weird to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know that Tom is a bully.
He's a most clear boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm very sure that wasn't what Tom means.
It'll not be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt that Tom would always be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it seems.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never had planned on living in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you are.
There is no excuse for his delay.
Tom must've been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad that Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book that he'd lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could've done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they're getting married.
They said they planned on going Monday.
It's not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me that they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid way too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
You must be ashamed of yourself.

You should've stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimist.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could've kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew that I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary isn't awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he set his mind to.
We married seven years ago.
I could've done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could've done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better at French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would've done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You need not pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should've tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised that they'd check on it.
I'm sure Tom would've agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must've put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was happy that you'd do that.
I always knew that Tom was a problemmaker.
Well I never!

I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom isn't busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I have just hard-boiled a egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said that they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.

I know that Tom is a very close friend of Mary's.
I know that Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?

Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans on doing that.
Tom could've asked me first.
You're not really suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should've.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom has ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I would've done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swear that they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should've stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they couldn't allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should've left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's neklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on?
We haven't yet started to fight.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everybody.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.

I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everybody's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was hard.
We have walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You'll do no such thing.
You're so hot!

Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.

I don't understand how this could have happened.
You are as tall as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom has already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he could be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stolen Mary's money.

I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You are a very naughty boy.
Tom plans on doing that in the near future.
We're late.
You are not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have email.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Tom said he hopes that you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wanted that he hadn't been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who is able to do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who is the lucky guy?
They prevented that they didn't know me.
I know Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if nobody stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you will succeed.
You know Tom and I are not going to do that, don't you?

Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.

Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That isn't faaible with current technology.
They said they tried to be optimistic.

I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook a omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.

He's not a virtuous.
I suspected Tom lied to me.
Tom eventually will need to do that.

He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.

I'll see it that that gets done.
I've got a suit but wear nowhere.
I'm as tired as you.

We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?

I met someone who knows that we.
Tom said that he thought those shoes were too expensive.

It was just a joke.
Tom said that he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should've brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
They told me that they were next.
I suspected Tom and Mary's not as alien to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know that Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We are sorry for the inconvention.

I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could've stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We are invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt repulsed.
I know that Tom is scared that he'll get lost.
I eat the same thing Tom did.
I know that Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried to.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know that Tom isn't a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everybody knows Tom is lying.
They're not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that isn't true.
I know Tom and Mary have both already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom decided that he isn't going to work today.

I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not going to work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought John could not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I would've been unable to do that without your help.
I knew that Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retreat.
If we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should've anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom was not known that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder whether Tom really knows the combination to this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan on doing that until I tell her to.
I didn't know that you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know that Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know that you needed to do that today.
You should have enrolled your children months ago.
I think that's not mine.
I believe Tom is 30 years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom that you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think that anyone had ever done that kind of a thing before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning on staying.
That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think that anyone did that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning on doing that tomorrow?
There were times I would've been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was stupid.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all heads.
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think that Tom needs to do that alone.
If I was you, I would go home at one.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom is married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape.
I thought you jury-rigged something.

I think Tom is like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew that Tom would like you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
I think Tom is still unecided.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen.
Tom said he'd do his homework before dinner.
Tom standed at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder whether Tom is really sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they want to die.

I suspect that Tom is on vacation.
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom is very brilliant.
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John got here.
Doing that would've been easy.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The sort of information we need is not always available.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know that Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know that I didn't need to do that, did you?
Tom suspected that it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sat back.
Tom was wearing the devil that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they were not alone.
The question is not so much what it is as how it looks.
I know that Tom is almost always right, but this time he's not.
Tom said to do that wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do that by yourself.
Tom must've had a key.
Tom knew that there was a chance that Mary would do that.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were family.
It isn't socially acceptable to point at people.
Tom would've allow Mary to do that.
I want we'd stay in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you said you'd never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary is planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know that Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time this week Tom has done that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened.
I know that Tom doesn't know he isn't supposed to be doing that today.
Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
Tom said he had a shovel in his pickup truck.
It was clear that Tom liked to do that by himself.
I don't think that what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was afraid.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I figured I'd find you here.
It'sn't clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom is doing okay.
Tom said he thought he didn't need to do that.
Tom said that Mary knew that he couldn't want to do that until John had time to help him.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I never should've got you in this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool?
Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
Tom said he thought that Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he'd come, but he never showed up.
I doubt that Tom has the strength to do what really needs to be done.
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
Tom is going to be able to do that eventually.

Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street.
Tom said that he thought I might have to do that soon.
Did you know that your socks don't match?
You know that's got to be done today, don't you?
I think Tom is about to start crying.
She took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Somebody's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did that wrong.
I knew that Tom could get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be curteous.
I think that's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cape?
Tom said Mary was able to do that, too.
That's a mistake a lot of people make.

It's not a easy solution.

I can't stand this noise.
I know that Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary.

I guarantee that's not going to happen.

Tom decided that he's going to say yes.

We're not planning to do that together.
Let's check why your answers differ from my.

However, every so often, the oath is taken amidest gathering clouds and raging storms. In these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our formers, and true to our founding documents.

Tom said he thought Mary could not be allowed to do that anymore.
I had no idea you knew Tom.
We will discuss this problem later.
I don't think Tom has anyone to help him.
How's it going?
Tom thinks he can do whatever he wants.
I know that I can't do that as well as Tom can.
I know that Tom is planning on doing that tomorrow.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be interested.
It's not especially hot today.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.
Tom said he didn't think he could do that kind of thing.
If you don't go, I won't even.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know that Tom doesn't know that I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought Mary didn't like him.
Tom said he did nothing illegal.
Tom said he already did that.
I think you're going to be OK.
I knew that Tom was still willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that he was happy that that had happened.
The computer has stopped working.
We know that you are not stupid.
She didn't turn up after all.
We both know that's a lie.
Tom knows we are't supposed to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom is in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should be doing.
Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you might know.
Tom's flaky.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom was aware that they were following him.
What the hell was that suggested to mean?
I know I'm in big problem now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would've never done that if Mary had asked him not to.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was hard to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom will be going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't even know the rules.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know someone must do that.
I can't talk French as well as you.
You should've listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite fast-food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we could do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
The clock has stopped.
Tom and I both grow up in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom will be back soon.
I didn't think we had enough money.
You should've heard me.
I'm giving you what you want.
I knew that Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him.
I know that Tom is a good writer.
They said they'd never want to do that.
They said they'd eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I always will.
No.
I know that Tom isn't a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone that he was unemployed.
I know that'll be hard to do.
How are you planning on doing that?
It's near me.
I am a bit out of shape!
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It's going to be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you had learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wanted that they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one is around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom probably will know how to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know that Tom knows why we didn't that on Monday.
Who is your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train.
I'm a lot taller than Tom.
I know that Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too.
I know that Tom would be quick at doing that than Mary.
My handwriteing is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew that I was planning to do that.
You should've been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
I should've been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's the reason Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt very seriously that Tom did that on purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is a exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should've done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think that Tom is as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She refused his eyes.
Tom isn't as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by myself.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom should be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should've introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to be retreated.
I can't recall when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever stated about that.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you're crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John could not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are OK.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time that you and I went to Australia together.
Tom isn't the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I pried off the member.
Tom said Mary was probably to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would've helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I have been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary had already a driver's licence.
I know that Tom is a fairly good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should've done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weathervane.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys.
I suspect Tom is at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must've left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to be married to Tom.
I didn't know that there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I presume that Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom can probably do that sometimes today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the table.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom moveing to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like living in Australia.
Tom said Mary should've done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was wrong.
What you are saying is absolutely wrong.
He is depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apps.
They said they'd never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's uncertain what he should do.
Tom told me that I should've said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said that he knew that Mary might not need to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't probably have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance that I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he doesn't plan on going with us this weekend.
I don't think that Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everybody loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know that Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom isn't the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you said that you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very beautiful boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said that it was Mary who told him that he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary is annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom isn't as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat suffered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I missed.
I think Tom is talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me that he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know that I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a beautiful place to visit.
I thought Tom was in a big problem.
I listen to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech left for three hours.
I wonder whether Tom is alive.
I could try to bore a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than one.
I can't recall anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never be coming back here.
I didn't know that you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom is doing something illegal.
Our streets flow when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom could be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know that Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has a idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could've done that better.
Tom said he wanted Mary wouldn't do that by himself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
What country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've done enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can ensure you that's not going to happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said he'd give a book to Mary.
It would have been unbearable.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know that Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly to blame.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans on doing that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on staying in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This is not salt.
Has anyone here seen Tom?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room that I do.
He did not keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was asleep on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspected Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone that he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a pinic if it's good tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they're irrited.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that when he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should be doing now.
I think Tom and Mary have been in Boston at least one time.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be sleepy.
Can someone please help me?
I know that Tom is about the same age as your daughter.
I know that Tom is a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I could not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is easy.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It seems like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to setle in her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swear that they'd never did that.
Everybody stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should've been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think that Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noise in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary is sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wanted that they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I have seen M. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Somebody's got to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that was when he was thirty.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said that I was the only one who thanked him.
It's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I think it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could've hit me.
They told me that they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm very sure that Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know that I was still planning on joining the team, did you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She has been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I have left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I've promised Tom that I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said to do that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Curgets are green.
I never should've broken up with Mary.
I wish I were in Australia right now.
Tom knew that I'd be early.
Tom tossed his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you miss in the entrance examing?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everybody that they were born.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really meaning.
I know that there will be a lot of good food at the pinic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said that he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They're inseparable.
Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised that they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must've done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should've expected that to happen.
It would've been wise to do that.
Tom told me that he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said that Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom has to be irrited.
For how long has your head been hurting?
Thanks, bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
Do you think we should've gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
I've got an earach.
I don't think that Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to live in prison without words.
I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know that Tom is a millionar.
Tom said that he thought that doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll let Tom do that.
No pain, not win.
I admit I've done that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here is your bag.
This is the first time Tom has ever stated about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
Tom would've done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he couldn't be allowed to do that.
I realize that that isn't very likely to happen.
They say that drug is not safe.
I know that it's highly unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's going to call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That never'd happen if you'd do what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think that Tom is the person you should be talking to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said that I had to study French.
You aren't obligated to do that, are you?
You've got a big head.
He's very smart.
I never would've hid Tom.
Does Tom know that you've done that already?
Tom eat more than I eat.
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I'd want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would've done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time is taken up.
I think Tom is conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary will't be able to do that.
They say they'll quit doing that.
Tom is incompetent.
Tom thinks that Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad that I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't like traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks that Mary can't do that.
I know that Tom is a golfer. Maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew that Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think that Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is talking.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you would like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew that Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should've quit while I was before.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You are not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all weeks?
Tom said he didn't know that even Mary was going to leave him.
You're not still afraid, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimed.
You will suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom know exactly how much it'll cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know that Tom is nice.
Tom already knows Mary is planning on doing that.
Don't take off your flowers.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom should've been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should've done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've dispised Tom since the first time I met him.
Are there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It's true that the earth is around.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Check out that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be happy.
I told Tom that you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.

I thought Tom wasn't afraid of anyone.
What names would you like?

Tom said he thought you'd win.
I thought I might be able to help.
I already knew Tom couldn't do that.
Tom says he'll do that when he's in Australia.
Tom says Mary is willing to do that for us.
Somebody else must've seen what happened, too.
Tom believed that was going to happen.
Tom said he thought Mary was mistaken.
I'm afraid Tom may have lost his way.
Did you know Tom was going to do that?
I wonder if we'll ever find out what happened.
I was just about to call you, but you beat me to it.
Tom wouldn't allow Mary to help him.
I was kind of surprised when Tom said that he wouldn't do that.
I think Tom and Mary are Canadians.
I couldn't sleep because of the heat.
Are you sure this is going to work?
I don't find that funny!
Tom and Mary said they'd probably do that.
You should put parentheses around this phrase.
Tom said Mary is probably still awake.
Tom said that Mary thought John might need to do that this evening.
Something don't always happen the way we expect.

They said that that was their favorite store.

Do you think you can sing for us?
I don't think it's weird at all.
It was clear that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
I think they'll have a chance.
Tom is planning to leave at 2:30.
This is an historical moment.
Everyone here except you have done that.
I want you to know I appreciate your help.
I know that Tom isn't able to play the bassoon very well.
You're a bit younger than Tom, are you?

I'm very sure I can do that.
A ball hit her on the right leg.

It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom is ready.
The game was put off until next week.
You are dead.
So does this restaurant have pilaf?
Tom and Mary are planning on going tomorrow, are they not?
Don't go near that.
Tom told me he wasn't planning on doing that.
I think Tom is discontented.
I should've said no.
You know that we don't have much time right now.
I don't think that Tom likes anyone.
The U.S. dominated the world after World War Two.
Tom and Mary don't know where John is planning to go.
The temperature in Boston is expected to drop to -8°F.
Can you take me home, please?
Tom told me he thought he could win.

I know that Tom might get in trouble if he does that.
Go to bed!
Tom called Mary and told her that he needed to stay in Boston for three more days.
Tom said he couldn't remember where he'd put his keys.
I don't think it's as important as Tom thinks it is.
I think Tom wants something to write on.
I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't want to do that.
Tom isn't someone you can easily replace.
I will try not to disturb you while you are studying.
Tom would've done that if he'd know he was supposed to.
I wonder what could've made Tom change his mind.
I know that Tom didn't know who did that for him.
Tom and Mary said they weren't able to do that.
I hope Tom gets the help he needs.
We must've taken the wrong way.

I have been struck by lighting twice.
I think you could've done this by yourself.
Tom said he didn't want to study French.
I swear that I didn't know that Tom would do that.
I wonder if Tom really wanted to go to Boston with us.
I think I'll go to Australia next year.
I thought you knew Tom couldn't speak French.
I'm slightly hungry.
I thought you said Tom did that.
I don't think anyone still knows.
They put their hats on and left.
Who would be stupid enough to do that?
Tom didn't tell Mary he was unappy.
You knew Tom told everyone he was going to do that, didn't you?
Tom realized that I didn't need to do that.
What's one thing that you really like to do?
Didn't you know there was a good chance that this would happen?
Tom said to do that may cause problems.
They said they need to get more sleep.

I doubt Tom will stick around.
They say they're too old to start over.
The store is closed Mondays.
I know that Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
I don't want to make a mistake.

Let's make believe we're cowboys.
I don't think I want to go there anymore.
Tom said he hopes you won't eat the last piece of cake.
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to do that.
I should've paid in advance.
We're going to go to the airport.
I doubted that Tom would be able to talk Mary in doing that.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
I didn't think anyone else had noticed.
That cat is so cute!
I'm very sure Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
I know that Tom is a mechanic.
A jack of all trades is a master of no one.
I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
I know you still want to be with me.
Tom told me he was unemployed.
I didn't know that you could understand French.
I doubt you will be happy with my report.
I should've known that Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you succeeded.
It'll take not less than one hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
You may use my desktop if you want.

I thought I had nothing to lose.
By daybreak the storm was over.
Nobody I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom is expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of gas is so high that we can't buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me that you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he hoped that Mary would be discreet.
"Thanks." "What for?" "For everything."
You are a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Anything is possible.

I knew that Tom didn't know that you were the one who had done that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there was still a lot of things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was happy that that was going to happen.
You are always doubting my word.
I didn't know that I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance that we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know that Tom isn't a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom shouldn't agree to do that.
I don't think Tom has sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should've left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should've stayed in Boston a few more days.
I should've told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pencil I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could've done that for you.
I think Tom is home.

Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What's the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused much damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone has given up.
Let's get our photograph taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'll probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspected Tom and Mary were planning on doing that tomorrow.
I didn't know how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to be doing this.
I know that Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something that I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know that Tom knows that I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know that Tom is scared that he'll get fired.
If I was you I would call the doctor.

I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Do you have a ti I could borrow?

That sounds awesome.

They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.

It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I'm here.
Nobody saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something that he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know that you're not mistaking me for someone else?
You should've refused to stay in Boston.
Nobody can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been let out prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He needn't have brought the umbrella.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were those who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but speak no.
You set up a trap.
I should've add more salt.
I know that that isn't what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom is smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom is sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could've got home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she doesn't plan on doing that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.
Tom hasn't even told us what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't need to do that.
I wonder whether Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he'd expect Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
Tom thinks that you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew that Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize that they're ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would've gotted here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom decided to stay in Australia for more three days.
Tom said that he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should've stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to do that.
I figured Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow.
I wonder whether Tom is pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would've done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know that Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know that your taxi lights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom is never going to hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You aren't going to get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not going to be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know that Tom didn't know that he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me before.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologised to each other.
You are not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John really will do that.
They say they also need to do that.
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me that they'd help me.
I don't think I'll always be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary says they don't think they snore.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everybody knew Tom could speak French well.

A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been in Australia.
I don't think Tom is as good-looking as John is.
Tom said that he thought that prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputs that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't recall.
Tom said he hoped he'd be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unfair.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know that Tom isn't afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
Nobody asked me if I liked it or not.
Many old people these days can't keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know that Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you will succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom said that he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broke.
Tom told me he thought Mary was misherable.
Can't this wait until morning?
We will be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom is unpredicted.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was probably to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know that Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to hospital.
I would've helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should've done that a long time ago.
I think Tom sleeped all afternoon.
I wonder whether Tom is upset.
Tom said that he knew that they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would've done that for Mary if he'd have more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something is still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom isn't planning on going to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk Mary in doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know that you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought to do that would be fun.
I think you'll discover that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Do you still plan on doing that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His young sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you would be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that'll happen.
Tom told everyone that he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was being true.
It's quite likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think that anyone had tried that before.
You should've made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looked like Mary had a really hard time to do that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you have me.
Tom said Mary could've done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was difficult to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could've told me early.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know that Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says that he only swears when it is absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom is high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me that he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned on going on October 20th.
They said they're doing just good.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I'd have done that if I could've.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew he'd been arrested.
Tom wanted that he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everybody knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that is not the case.
Tom found the watch he lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said that he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must've left the window open.
I know that Tom is a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know that Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just standing the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts that you'll be able to pass the exam.
Where's everyone?
How have you been feeling?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not complicatory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should've hid someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overwight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said that he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom is Chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom is going to be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he's happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you would've wanted.
I know that it's highly unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not probably that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he was impossible to win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a chance, Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not hungry.
Tom may have done the same thing that Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophomore.
Tom definitively knew that he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom shouldn't have ever tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would've let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she couldn't have to do that again.
They swear that they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know that Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said that Mary would do that.
They've said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said that he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I want he would.

We went up by two floors to get the apparel stalls.

Tom thinks he's going to die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know that Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he'd never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should've talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the small thing.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this'll work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know that you can hear me.
You seemed to be unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought he might need to do that.
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom gave me a lot of things.
I know that Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know that Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan on staying at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing.
We both love Tom.
Tom said that he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she could be allowed to do that this evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.

You could've let me know you were going to be late.
Tom's delicious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
