The workshop has been at least in the end of the trade
The workshop has corrected its losses after the crazy sugar.
Transactions continuing with the Czech Energy Effect (CHEZ) are increasingly close to the late day trade.
The practical office has continued to prevent a weekend from the beginning of the custom trade when he eats almost six percent.
In this way, the Wall Street's party's stairs are behind the reduction.
We also opened the market reaction to the result of the voting of the American representative's vote, which rejected the support of the financial sector stabilization plan.
Detail in Asia
In Asian challenges, the dramatic opportunities of participants have lived, while the indicators have finally deleted a part of losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng cupsindex wrote almost four percent of the trade, but later the losses deleted one of the losses and reduced the reduction to about 2.5%.
In Hong Kong, the Chinese parts were able to achieve a 3.8 per cent of the Indian Enterprises Index, the markets were closed in Sangaj.
The party of Sydney was lost more than five percent, but finally the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan's cup has 3,6 percent of the entire index.
Joseph Yam, the Hong Kong Financial Advice Leader of Hungary.
Hong Kong, noah of China, is defined by its financing policy, as well as from the Central Bank of China.
In Hong Kong, stones are on the same level with the United States.
According to the Ministry of Australia, Kevin Rudd should immediately restart the negotiations, and they should adopt the proposal for the financial system of support.
In addition, other countries have the consequences of this.
Health of the American party
The American representative has rejected the plan of support for the financial system for 700 billion dollars (because 12 billion corners).
In this regard, the lawyers have noticed the calling of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush says that the plan would make the main issues of financial crisis and help to stabilize all economics.
Wednesday, the American parties have lived in blood and the leadership indexes have been registered by 20 years of the greatest suffering.
Dow Jones was eating almost seven hundreds of years, and he lived in 1987.
The index was already made before the vote, but as it was explained that the proposal was not accepted in the representative's house, the index was started in the freedom.
The Congress has returned: the Government of the United States can build 700 billion dollars in banks
The Prime Minister of the United States Congress and President George W. Bush agreed in the closest form of the Agreement and financial assistance for the American Financial System.
They vote from this at the beginning of the next week.
In the negotiations continuing to approval of the United States laws, 700 billion dollars (except 12 billion corners).
But I have no guest yet.
The Congress must include several details of the Agreement before they could be opened by the final form and votes of the law.
Financial system support plans are undertaken in the Conservative House for weeks.
He reported this on Sunday, President of the Reuters President Barney Frank, the Committee of Financial Organisms.
According to the senate resources, it may probably vote to the most challenge of the plan.
Assistance providers should be informed of the approval of the saving plan, which is the first important factor for the survey of financial markets.
Thanks to the equipment of the mechanisms, however, it's going to be "increasing".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We did a lot of steps.
We have resolved our separate views on the form of the group that serves to stabilize the market," reported to the Democratic Nancy Pelosi Agent Bloomberg.
I think the final vote is still a weekday.
The representatives of laws have met with Henry Paulson, the American Financial Ministry in order to give the government's final form.
This should be exchanged from financial companies to non-profit reporting actives which are carried out and ensure the stability of the whole system.
"We are calling to the final agreement about a plan that will work and which must also be effective in the market.
The plan must continue, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Information on Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant effect on the participation markets that are lowly.
According to the Democratic Democracy of Harry Reid, the laws officers are able to agree in the Congress even on Sunday.
This is the same way they want to restrain investors before starting trade in Asian financial markets, where the Congress’ decision could first affect the weekly trade.
However, yet not clear, the United States Congress two chambers when he votes about the law, as it does not, even if the discussion is not in the last time.
Legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next days.
However, the law is going to be a number of changes.
The total sum of the system must be divided in two parts.
According to the request of President George Bush, the first 350 billion dollars should be available quickly.
However, the Congress may block the expenditure of the currency, which has been determined for more than 100 billion dollars and later 350 billion dollars, when it will be feeling that the program does not implement its function.
Bush evaluated the progress in the negotiations
When the President can protect this Decision, the Congress will still reveal its protector.
However, on the contrast of these changes, the programme has remained based on the program which was the manufacturer of maternal instruments that served to discharge their values, because more than hundreds of thousands of Americans could not be able to eliminate the notifications.
"We worked everything.
On the law, the representative should have to vote on Sunday, and the Senatus at week, "Judd Gregg, the Republican Senator.
The US President Bush was dead in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, adviser of Bush, stated that the President was sufficient and assessed to "the two-part-part-suffering strengths made to be stabilised and to protect our economy."
Restriction of the bus' final requirements
Christopher Dodd, President of the Secretary Bank Committee, said that the lawyers have agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, protection of suppliers from losses, closement of goods, and the time of financial plan.
The new law also limits the implementation of the officers involved in the programme and brings the Base Control Committee.
The basis should be directed to the Financial Ministry.
"We worked very hard with this, and we made a great progress in a direction of the assembly that will work, and that will be useful for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes assistance for households who have problems with the disruption.
The Government should cut out new detailed statements, in order to reduce the data weather detailers, and allow their homes to preserve their homes.
Marque: Little ship
The proposed plan David Marek, the Director of Patria Finance, says that a good idea, but it will be very difficult.
"I think it's because it's not possible to know that the problems's actives with what mechanism and what area they're going to explore.
This will be determined that the financial sector and the government shares the losses between each other," says iHNed.c homes of Marek in the week.
Marek says that it's not so important that the plan is now or at the beginning of the next week.
"It is more important that the congress has already been able to be able to support the plan, and as possible, they give their blessings.
The spirit's importance to born an agreement about that the plan's approval is the most important thing in this moment," said Marek.
Parching money: MP3 players against mobiles.
How to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be phoned.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
Instead, there's a lot of trouble to make a special MP3 player.
The choice is totally depending on the method of use and the property requirements.
Probably it's hard to go home with a low-quality disk to hear the last Maxim Turbulenc disk.
Eventually, such music products are not shown in bacterias, but there is no objective in this quality point.
However, if there are pools with art rock, jazz or blue bacterias, we may likely sleep about such a disc player.
This is similar to the traveling, such as MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some may be acceptable for a player for eight thousand corners as if a Pink Floyd is probably hard to take a 20-horn market earlier guarantee.
Two heights that everybody has enough place.
It's a wide choice.
The contents of the elements are also calculated
Some of the quality music playing can be more than playing the simple music, but also that most of the mobiles are not even unlikely.
There's no universal preparation now as the phone.
First functions, phone and sms sending, music and video can also play, both of them, there's a better-fast photographer, even though it can be navigated.
And if we take the smartphones and communicators, there's a little computer in the kitchen.
It's a little amazing, because there's no famous trucks can grille and no television can picture.
The other functions have the backgrounds.
If you use more functions on the phone, the indicator sends more times to the load.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy policy.
A little mobile reading can play 10-12 hours longer, more than this is less.
In this regard, music players (including the most easiers) are significantly greater implementations.
That's why you're not going to play you for a few hours.
If you still have a phone in here, you're going to get the workplace to the safety's favorite, and it's also the best preparations.
The MP3 players will not be such a problem, even the worst ones will carry up at least 9 hours with one upload.
The next problem is uploading the music mobile.
Sorry, the products are only limited with the Universal USB Connector and none of them can be directly connected without the special software.
Of course, the music can directly move to the memory card, but only a small card reader will be attached without adapter using the memory cards used in the mobiles.
There are no special software required except some players (iPod).
Get enough preparation from the computer with music via USB.
Most of the mobiles and players are already able to create a musical folder based on the user assessment.
Some preparations are just cutting fabric as Windows Explorer, and some of you both know (river, Samsung, Sony, Cown, smart phone operation system).
Players are easierly handled, mobiles can be more
The specific equipment is first interested in the choice of the assumulator's lifehold, memory capacity, sound quality and type, and, naturally, the requirement of treatment.
If the music serves you first as background and you just listen for a short time, for example, on the villamos, any MP3 phone that plays with you.
And that's actually any mobile.
You don't need to be particularly careful, the phone or the player knows how music formats.
The MP3 will be explored and the majority of the decisions of the MP3 will be in this format.
The majority of the manufacturers of the MP3 passengers are included and otherwise, the majority of the products are explored with the WMA format.
The AAC (with the Apple company and the iPod) is turned to be less.
The right mobiles are also allowed to use online renewal.
Perfectly through the mobile internet to visit the service pages (or other service) and to switch the bottom or album.
This service may also be a pressure interest in the musical phone.
I'm sorry, the slaves will be driving and usually be limited to a single radio slider.
The prices are not the less.
However, it is usually possible that the music will rule in the future by the GSM, Internet or without leaders.
Most people keep their mobile equipment constantly.
Anyway you like to listen to something, your mobile books your phone in the kitchen while the forgotten MP3 playing home.
However, it still works, or he always takes the hearers or at least the challenges.
If not, you can use the embedded sound phone, which almost all the phones, but only a small MP3 player.
Many of them will probably be the biggest price of music mobile.
In general, the leather are less than three-mill corners.
Three and four thousand corners can be a lot of honourable fightman.
However, you are limited to the missing of the exit of the reliable earlier.
The best and technical phones can also be carried into the range of 3,5 mm transmitters or 11,000 corners.
The players are able to prevent the easy ability except for the same time.
The most easily - not necessarily, everybody is actually inclined to be treated with the treatment of the most recent players (see our choices).
The minimum function, the normal cash is open to a magnetic or a graphphone.
No rate of compilation in the mobile Internet format unexpectedly attached, and not the following data account.
What preparation we choose
The most recent mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually opened to replaceable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
It also includes maximum two thousand corners with the appropriation of the corresponding card.
But be careful.
Basic types only support the maximum capacity maps of 2GB.
Only the most drugs know what to start with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even a MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsungot, Emgeton or Iriver.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), no more than 1 100 corners should be carried out.
If you are the needed listers, choose special mobile warkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungok).
These preparations are also special MP3 manager buttons, the treatment requires the MP3 player.
The most easier is the Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface for warman's mobiles as the special MP3 players.
The MP3 playing MP3 markets can be reached to four thousand corners in the same category, but with greater memory capacity (or 16 GB) and acumulators (for 15 hours, at least 35 hours).
The first virtual officer still came to Czech.
Perhaps
The Czech Mobil market and our services are usually the same as their west-European partners.
Instead of this, there is something we have — a virtual service that produces classic servants to reduce significantly.
Maybe it's not a long time.
In the Mobil.cz hotel, we have already written that Cheche slaves are in Europe in the most drugs.
In other words, the CTU also confirmed that it was noticed that the price in Czech is more precious than the other countries of the Union.
After the last step of the European Commission, the rules of roaming may be a contrary situation - some of the Czech Mobile Services' clients will be better than the households.
How is it possible that the Chess Prices compared to Europe are such high?
The answer is simple, it's really missing the competition that wants to fight.
This may be contrary, because we have three mobile networks and penetrations increased about 100%.
The mobile officers are in contrast to ensure that the market is increasingly competitive.
In the same way, Paul Dvoreak, also President of the Czech Telecommunication Official Council, who had reported several times that there is no new officer in Czech.
Perhaps true that the classic serviceer is probably not too many chances (but it is probably difficult to find frequency).
But there's another opportunity to be a virtual service.
That is why the amount of significant reduction of virtual services to mobile markets, after which the classic services should also be reacted.
In the meantime, before going to the large fish market, such as Tcos Mobile or Virgin Mobile Grand Britannica, the sounds of similar sounds have heard.
However, he convinced that such servants have locations and may actually succeed.
But for example, we don't have to go too long.
We have informed you in February on the introduction of the mobile virtual service officer.
This employee could not be completely half years, even 100 thousand customers and become the fifth greatest officer.
However, after Mobilking, the Penta Financial Group is in Czech, which is the owner of U:fon.
The virtual services provides the possibility of concentration on a lot of severe target group.
The same work requires much less customers with the Economic Service.
The same high-building, mobile network operating and maintenance costs are not in the same way.
Virtual servants in the world are usually low-country - calls and sms, however, often disturbed with smaller service.
Thus, for example, the Grand-Britanian Tsco Mobile is in the companies at least 50 percent of the competitive society.
But as it shows the example of the Länder’s Mobilking, it can also be accepted to an objective group.
This service is the same special focus on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service - who loves them who can trust you," says David Seibert, the manager of the mobile Entertainment Company.
It is hard to say whether we have an idea similar to the Länder.
Miroslav Čepica, Vodafone's dictionary, says: "The market is very small for the seeding approach based on most of the virtual services.
Furthermore, it was exceedingly useful in the respect of the ministry."
In Czech, the mobile servers are set in
However, it seems to be almost sure that if there's a virtual service in Czech, it's not the Mobiliking.
"We are talking about a successful project, but the conventions in Czech are not too expected.
In other countries, Mobil.cz's telephone interview, Jana Studničk, the Penta Financial Group.
In this regard, he justified that Chess’ existing mobile services are not exceedingly confronted with this opinion.
In contrast, all of them will be able to do so that no potential competition will be created.
The GTS Novera group has no interest in the virtual adjustment, which would like to make a further step in order to become a real competition in the fields of customers.
"It's very interested in us that our clients are not only leading, but also the mobile telecommunication services.
Not even before, it's better.
We've retraced this option with all chat mobile servers.
With some of the citizens, Paul Kaidl, the dictionary of the group has already been prevented in the negotiations," says Paul Kaidl.
Maybe it's better time now.
Not official information seems to be happy for the first virtual service or to the end of the year.
However, his birthday is increasingly increasing hearing walls around.
"In this moment, we don't think that the full-valuable virtual service provider would be located on the Cheche market.
The market is very special in the contrast of other markets.
He has not always spoken in us a single, complex and serious subject in this field," announced the Mobil.cz Customimil Srschň, the Telephone 02.
The Czech market also refers to the special situation of other services.
Martina Kemr, the T-Mobile Dictionary, adds with the O2 exclusively: "We have not yet established a pre-profit business project, which could be further funded."
And he said, "In the T-Mobile network, it is not likely to open any virtual service.
In this moment, it should have been a specific agreement on the desktop that you should think about this short street."
Vodafone shall be transmitted to the implementation of its 3G licences.
Miroslav Cepical adds: "We have been able to negotiate with possible virtual services, in particular in the area of distribution of costs and infrastructure.
We're just taking this on the basis of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy to build networks shared on the fast mobile network."
Officers - a office with the officers
The process of mobile servers can easily be understood, and a new service provider will report the growth of competition, the reduction and the reduction of their benefits.
So why do we easily make a competition in this?
When the officers have something important, I can cooperate, the U:fon's birth house is also testified.
The most largest pressure of the T-Mobile company has probably been difficult to be born in the U:fone.
This will be testified of the CTU home of publicly available information.
But now the U:fon comes well to be aware of why we don't allow it to enter the virtual service.
Martina Kemr added: "The environment of the mobile market competition has recently been informed to the market of the fourth mobile service market.
The Czech Mobile Market Market is clear that a new player will ensure high requirements for markets and services."
However, the entire independence of Cheche regulatory organisations is directly increasing that mobile servers are increasingly interested.
However, it is not only the CTU Attachment that is in Czech – from the Great Britain and other developed countries – there is no right to enter into the economic concurrence.
It was just right to the Economic Verseny Office.
However, the office is not worthy of all the problem.
"Speak on the virtual service market only afterwards it would be possible to enable the Treaty between the mobile server and the virtual service provider to ensure the necessary infrastructure.
There were no such contracts yet linked, because the rate of potential interesters was probably not appropriate to employees," said Christian Chlapua, the Economic Verseny Office, answering our question.
Probably nobody would open a statement accepted by the representatives of the services.
However, from the office that the consumer should be considered interests and others should also be advised that nobody could return to the market situation is more weird.
Furthermore, if Christian Chalupa adds: "In the country where virtual services are generally working, we can notice that their markets have contributed to reducing the price of mobile services."
However, the UNOHS interests are probably not required to operate correctly and pressure to reduce the prices.
In the case, it is actually multiplyable with the three mobile reactions.
The question, probably, is it just about the words that are almost understood of yourself.
Like the fully identical benzines of the loadings, only the ill and severe competition works.
"The official has not held the signs of the concurrency procedure, so there is no way to enter into any way.
One of the officers has no manager position or no responsibility for the facts of the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market of services may probably miss the telecommunication regulator,” said Chalupa.
The indication of the market leading situation is one of the number of points of rate.
Of course, there is an analysis of real markets developed by the CTU, based on the telecommunication of the only market from the economic competition.
Naturally, there is no leader in the situation of such markets.
However, some jurisdictional experts also need other concerns — it is always necessary to approval the network employer.
And the mobile server has a monopholium logical network.
So, in a certain challenge, it's necessary to domain.
But even if we don't accept this concern, the UOHS should be the minimum incentive for three mobile servers in the same way.
The rows of interesters (including the GTS Novera company mentioned already) indicates that the discussion with each employee is very similar.
In the telecommunication, the responsibility to the CTU is a significant striking market, where UNOHS takes his hand on all the case.
We've met this in some similar situations.
In the recently adopted telecommunication law, I am so sorry, the extension of the CCTU legislation in the Economic Concurrence of Telecommunication could not be crossed in the telecommunication area as well as a number of experiences expected to improve the situation.
These are the representatives of the UOHS, but probably others are their interests.
This works when nobody watchs
In the meantime, the operation of some viral services that are already working in the Cheche’s mobile networks.
These are their own phone services companies, however, are only often public.
This is the same of the companys working with multilevel marketing.
So, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others have their own mobile phone services.
These companies are usually only to the elections.
The weapon hides the company as a classical client with the officer, which makes a large quantity of SIM card.
After exchanged customers, special prices (and other benefits) are received.
The problem is that all the market conditions of the mobile services are disappeared to the same provision.
"If there were cases that are talking about, the conditions of the Treaty could be said about the disagreement that we would work with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with that society," answered Martina Kemr.
But it is unlikely that notices about the efficiency would not be taken to the responsible persons of the mobile officers.
First, in the case of three companies, it may be said about thousands of customers.
However, none of the officer is protected against such procedures.
They have the same rewards of the activities of these companies and, in particular, their own official marketing is not restricted, especially from real virtual services.
Miroslav Cepical advertising on possible problems: "The law allows similar specializations, however, the services of these companies only uses a percentage of the customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not in their name, so they can't be fully able to be like the general officers of the mobile officers."
But the CTU should be at least amazing.
Furthermore, another question will be issued for the UOHS.
If the mobile servers look at the same procedure, why should they adhere to the virtual service born?
It must be added to that UNOHS has a strong right to promote efficiency, and if you don't want to, you should not remember the statement of the services that they have not hid anything such and that their trade conditions have been rejected.
When we're not the worst.
As the text has already been voted several times, the virtual services have brought the ability to reduce the ability to the mobile market.
In the meantime, in every country where the virtual services were created, classic servants were intended to achieve more than less than one of them.
They used their interests were often the same — too small, likely enough market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developing countries, in these moments, the regulatory organisations, which have not been protected by mobile officers, but their clients.
Then, with formal measures or information pressure, the first virtual employer who followed others has been created.
I'm sorry, the Cheche regulatory officers do all the matter to each other.
On the basis of our packaging, we can't be free from the injury that the unexpected competences will come well to them in these cases.
But we don't give the fight.
If the Background information is well and the virtual service provider is actually shown soon, the cable mobile market may be moved again.
If some service service would allow a virtual mobile server to create, UNOHS can only be difficult to reduce further interesters (discrimination).
And maybe we're not going to phone any more on the other parts of Europe.
The new Chesh Himnous has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech State Himnous.
Wednesday, the Ministry of Mirec Topola showed the celebration of the Czech United States where I'm home?
The fool and the National Sinehaz dreamed with the guidance of the white balls of Jiri.
Four versions are available with men or women, singers or instrumentally.
Catherine of the priest and Adam Plachetka sing.
The manufacturer of the change of himnous Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krčk.
The iHNed.t can listen to the four versions at home.
The white flowers holds one of the most beautiful himnishes.
The Czech Radio has already mentioned that youth representative songs have chosen for the upgrading of the variables, which are expressors and people.
"But from the beginning of both of them, and later, I began to take the pure dictionary, the text to understand well and to observe the sound," said he.
The celebration of the 175th anniversary for the future of the Czech State Hengnous.
Where am I home? The branch was first in the Rendi Singhai in 1834, Joseph Kaetan Tyl Fidlovačca, completed with the French Schcroup music.
It's amazing, and people were spontaneous to their own.
And the first verse of the valley, after the 1918-yemen, has changed the natural part of the state himnous.
After the establishment of the Czech Republic, there remained one of the seven state marks.
What's the "new" hello?
The workshop of Transport Company shall also be carried out with the first cart of transport
On 1 October 2008, the first route will be an electronic bus in place of paper line in metros, villages and buses.
Currently, the score can be achieved around a hundreds of which are located with the Opencard chipcard.
30 days and 90 days, and an annual cost (amount to 1 January 2009) can be sold, and even though their chip carts are driving in the information center of the Court of the Court and the provisions of the Museum, Middle, Nadrarje Holesovice, Andel, Roztyly, Lewis, Kobylisy, Rajski, Kačrov and Luka metalloms.
The bupons are also explored by the Internet since yesterday by the Communication Business on www.dpp.cz home.
The service was used for more than four hundred clients until the Sunday hours.
Those who begin to use the Internet trade will be completely forgetting the expenditure windows in which they have been regularly used long lines for lines.
The center can be able to switch through the Internet and to the Opencard card to one of the 13 sons of the Watch Book.
"In these places, it is available to the travellers with a pool instructed servers who help the interesters in the Internet's market and their cards, as well as their coffined bupons," said Martin Opatrny, the project voter.
Besides the folders, the electronic bupons can be saved to Opencard in the auto-services stored in some forwards.
How are these cars looking?
Pirosak, the reporters and the travelers may have already taken them on the Development, Budajovick, I. P. Paula, Florenc and Valtavsca meters.
"Now there's five of them in the city, but they should be eight to the end of the year," he healed Opatr.
The focus automatically checks in place of the software
It is easy to handle the autos starting tomorrow.
It's enough to fix the Opencard chipcard and save yourself from the first payment.
The electronic bupons are not only in the main office, but also in the area.
So the city's around lines and carriers, from 300 to 499, with which the centre-check roads are first in the main carrier.
"The integrated traveling lines have been seen with fishing readers, which are also with help to determine the validity of the Cupones' economy," explained Philip Dra with the Ropid Organisation, which consists of the procedure for practical interactions.
In autobuss around the city, the card readers are built by the manager.
When entering, then, the shop should not only show the chip card, but also the Opencard must be placed on the page of the money page.
So the shooter checks the validity of the bupons.
"For example, if you need the road to check the validity of the bulks, it's easier to ask the shooter this," he healed Drap.
The travellers who don't have a city's autobuses and don't remember that their bus is valid when they go back, they can go again to their own servers to the cards.
The information about the validity of their economy is shown in its statement.
The Jews wanted a population from the United States.
In 1945, the Germany of Sweden is attached to the United States in Shumava.
This is out of the letter that is in the assembly of the South-Czech Republic of Scientific Book.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States patron.
Normally, with this request, some German groups have turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also explicit from a letter of a single arcade that is maintained in the assembly of the South-Czech Republic of Scientific Library in our days.
The Germans of Czech Krumlov are requested by the President of the United States to not allow the recurrence of the "Shumavai Yeye" Czech, which Hitler has taken on the basis of the Munchen Treaty.
"We really want to be sure of the situation, and we really want to be sure in the words that the American teams believe in Germany are not as an extreme and enemy, but as a rescue," says the book, "Mans who carry the row of Sumbah in their heart."
Since the connection to CzechSlovaquia is intended to the Germany - the Czech national signs - only to brutality, unfortunateness, not to understand, pressure and slavery, the letter requests the President of the American President to take Suma over the proctor "forever and forever".
"We can't believe that in the absence of the opinion of four million people would judge this area for us for a stranger country who will go and disappear the minority, and nothing will almost go to the winning of the covenant," states the record.
That's why the authors couldn't be able to write, the fear of the "show pressers" crazy.
So, if the President of the United States would be in doubt in the opinion of Shumavia Germans, it would be sufficient to maintain references in the shomaways, whether the United States want to be a part of the United States and if they want to live under the patron of the United States.
However, the text of the letter appears to be a little nave near the future knowledge of the war, some historians, according to the expectations of the Germany.
Even if the Czech Germans had to be minimized that they would be able to make it out of the country, they had only been known less.
Some were expected that the United States and the British were standing in the autonomy of the Jews.
Others believed that they were just in Czech Slovakia.
This is justified by Gustav Chalupa, the born newspapers in the Czech Budajovic.
Chalupa served to the sea in Balti Sea as a German Buddhiovice under war.
When the British had been taken in the war, and they had been able to be able to struggle, many other Germans came to him to learn them to be courageous.
"They trusted that if they're going home, they're welcome to them the chicken language," said Chalupa.
The Germans who lived before the war in Czech Slovakia said nobody had considered that the Benes Decrements were established from the country.
You don't think you're gonna pay.
The emotional campaign attachs the leaders
In the story of the chaque, the most precious action for the safety of the streets.
It would also be possible to indicate the powerful media campaign, which will be intended to start the Ministry of Communities.
The Ministry of the Greeks from this campaign hoped that the leaders would take a risk of the government.
There will be 150 million campaigns in TV, radio, mobile, Internet, but also in words.
The leaders should be ridiculed from speed and alcohol.
And it should also be reminded of them that they're cutting safe wheels in before they're coming.
First, young leaders, motor carriers, freaking, and not finally want to speak to the intelligence of public leaders.
And what's going on in the records?
Emotions, first human history.
The whole campaign's "beloved" slogan also:
You don't think you're gonna pay.
The expression "You don't think" is written with a lot of characters.
And in the blood board, it's the word "pagess".
This must be indicated that a man can pay his life for a momentless care.
The viewers are the records to the entire 2010 "remistge".
The Ministry of England's campaigns were reflected in which the drastical images of the victims of balance are regularly viewed.
They hope that the number of balances and dead in the cheese paths are so reduced.
The Euro RSCG Agency prepared records.
Let's go, let's go to the shooters.
"To the passenger's, replace it" system is valid.
It's for them when they're going to the piroson, for example, they're going for a time.
'Cause' is a danger of punishment or an accident.
The shooter needs to remember the risk," says Martin Korzan, the Na Homolce hospital psicologist.
And that's why you need the information campaign in the ship, first to the negative campaign, considers psychologist.
I think the shooter's warnings are less efficient to the dangerous tables.
"If the dangerous warning table is reached, you may probably be reading soon with the environment and the leaders don't work with it," advised Corean.
At least all of the entire areas would be returned to the family for peace.
Haud Olmer, the president of the temporary Israeli Government, talked regularly about the return of all areas held in 1967, about the western part of Jordan, West Jerusalem, and Golan-Jerusalem, for peace with Palestinian and Siria.
He said this in an interview that Jediot Akron published a day-day.
"We need to stay with Palestinians, which means that at least everybody, if we don't have to return the areas, "Said Olmer to the Sunday.
"We have a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to give a percentage similar to the Israelites areas, because it will not be peaceless."
He felt that the opportunity of return is involved in the Kelet-Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and first wants to not tractors and idiots to go through the feet, as one of my best friends happened, I must give one part to Jerusalem," reported Olmer's two July towns for the battle, which some people killed, and some tucatians were assaulted.
According to the Ministry, "Special solution to Templom, Holy and Historical places" will be needed in the office.
"Whoever wants to keep Israel's sovereignty over all the city has to integrate 270 000 Arabic.
It's not going to work," she sounded.
Explore from Golan Citys
Olmert has also mentioned the opinion of the exhibition of the Israelites of Golan-function, which believes that it is unresolved to the peace agreement associated with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain strength of the part of Damascus.
"I'm not suggesting the peace with Siria just on the basis of the exemption of Golan," advertised.
"The circles know what they need to tell you to get Golan.
They must provide the current relationships with Iran; they need to give the relations with Hezbollahhal (site movement); they must provide the systemic support that Hamas (site movement), the Al-Kaida and Djihad (the Holy War), in Iraq, has to be able to give the system of support that Hamas (site movement), the Al-Kaida and Djihad (the Holy War).
Ask after a difficult question: Are the travellers in the cars?
The law doesn't know them, it's not free to walk in a remote bus
In relation to the tragedy autobuss equipment of the Student Agency company, the question was submitted near the Italian Padova, whether the travellers and travellers can travel in the bus.
"If we would like to maintain the law, the traveling activity is in contrast with the law on transmission activities," says Karel Hanzelka, the representative of the Communities Ministry.
In the past week, a 20-year-year traveling traveller's driver was probably carried out the car traveling travel.
The girl's unfortunateness at that moment he was sitting near the shoe, at the minimum safe place of the bus, almost two more places.
The bus may be busy or unexpected, even in the moment when the traveling coffee is served, or the newspaper.
There's a shield, or the bus is, according to the permission of the car.
If there's no homologation in the bus, they have to sit in the streets.
Student Agency's remote buses are not available, which confirmed the currently.cz, Radim Jančura, also his company manager.
"We tried to find a solution with this Ministry, and first the ways were not allowed to be moved.
However, it was returned, and we found that the travellers can go to the way to the continuous way when they have their own seats," he said.
The law does not know the traveller
"It does not exist a clear legal regulation on the traveling roads - no legislation regulates this position.
However, any laws for the driving driving does not reject the review of services.
The law on the Mediterranean Treatment only knows the reputation of the vehicle; it does not determine its rights and obligations," makes it less clearly Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorni, the manager of the Middle Ministry of Trade Trade Agency, in contrast, believes that the law handles the problem according to the law.
"If it depends on whether the autobus is able to be able to fix the car.
And it's over, he says.
According to their separation of buses, cities may be limited and limited to maximum speed, as well as in the cities, with larger speed, and without remote states, and with the largest speed of security seats.
Like the aircraft, he says the expert
Jaroslav Hořen, the BESIP Transport Security Expert in moving travellers, does not see the basic problem on the bus feed.
"It's not a lot of dangers during the continued deadline, we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
It's not sure when there's Turbulency and the aircraft can cut his head."
"If the bus would be able, of course, physical laws are valid.
Like in town buses or town cars.
The safety of travellers must be resolved with the internal rules of the aircraft," says and also believes that the problem has not been resolved on the basis of the law.
Jančura ready to leave services
The Student Agency is a single bus driver for Chinese traveling services.
You're working for two hundred travellers.
The manager doesn't have businesses to risk.
"But as I'll be so grateful that the travellers are risking, and I've lost.
The coffee and the newspapers can get it when the travelers enter.
It's also a payment of costs," she says.
In his vehicles, he made the missing of travellers, Alexej Litvin, the Asian director, who worked with Student Agency.
"No travellers, we're against this from your beginning.
First or later, this ends with some dead suffering," he said a year ago to Tyden.cz.
Unbelievable tragedie
A two-year-old young traveller who worked in the community died during a polygonal procedure.
The Slovak chamber, probably, without the use of direct signals, has been exchanged out of the remote ship and has stopped the autobus.
His bus shooter was trying to get out of the steel, but the bus's better remote part of the bus was connected.
It would have been sold for two occupied locations that serve the traveller's calm, and it refuses to reject.
"They can't be occupied with the remote travels, they're blocked."
The company wants to get the leader of the camera in.
The Agency is not expecting the judgment of the law, but also expects the financial offence of the crime part.
Shooting?
In the remote future
The correction of the movement of travellers could be reported in the car cars for law-indication, which works more than a year in the transitional Minister’s thirty-first experience group.
"But the group hasn't come to any specific results.
The autobuses are not so much, and the point system is working in the car with the maximum allowed speed and the mobile use between the driver," says Horien Experience.
"The Communities Ministry does not maintain the activities of travellers, which should be based on the safety of the travellers, "ordered Hanzelka on the control of the safety of the buses requires the police and the officers.
The Daisseldorph hopes are Frankfurton
The letter written to the bank employees of WestLB is not increasingly confronted.
The Desselldorf Financial Agency and Frankfurti Deka-Bank could be created by the "the Central Capital Market Organization" of the Financial Agency and the Frankfurti Deka-Bank, writes the letter published in the weekly.
WestLB would enter a "competence block" in such a business.
Such connection would be given to further conventions in the regional bank sector of the decision.
This reading is when a manager wants to prove the capacity of action in difficult times.
Because the uncertain situation is still difficult to press a strong pressure on the WestLB bank.
Not only the Commission of the EU, but also the part of the Federal Service Office, which recently knew the north-riven-percental territorial border, to exceed the limit of the resolve of sustainable solution.
However, the new Deka-Bank and WestLB have been a good time for the customers of investment bases, however, of the same relationship - frankfuurte part.
Franz Waas, leader of the Deka-Bank, already in the end of August, under recognition of the average data that the bank found in Mainzer Landstraßes and a regional bank, such as Helaba or WestLB Fuzzy.
In addition, the Governor Deka, which represents one of the regional banks, and the other parts of the representatives of the post-financial contracts, trusted the Government to continue negotiations with WestLB on the common business activities.
In this case, the main market business or some parts of it may be used.
However, the negotiations - the financial areas - they just started now.
The name of Deka-Bank, a majority of the French financial sector, is not first in relation to the consolidation of the railway sector.
In 2003, the Deka-Bank seemed to be part of the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalzcal and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from the third covenant.
The plans, the Government of the Hospital, have made a publication against the interests of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks were not found.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was located to Stuttgarti Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, again and again, the thought of the Deka-Bank and the Regional Banks.
However, the President of Helaba, the President of Helaba, was discussed against the conference plans with his bank.
This does not depend on the recognition that it is necessary to approach the various banks of the community sector.
Now, after the field collection, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are first expected.
This isn't a good new for Helaba.
If the pressure to further fusions is focused, the possible partners can be taken for a long time.
In Southern Germany, only a younger employee, he died the financial crisis even more than the munchen and the steatgart banks.
And the fusion of WestLB was 85% of the company in Helbo, Giroverband Hessen-Türingen, in the beginning of the year.
Better news, North LB remains.
However, such geostrategic approaches are only one side of the feelings.
On the other hand, the question is questioning how different business models are one of the other banks.
Merl in June stated that the German Tacking Pennsylvania and Court of Justice has not yet given an answer to the decision-making question to ensure the future of the regional banks.
Finally, you can even imagine the WestLB's exploitation, but you don't want to understand it.
So the e-mail of the officer is also listening that it is a "complete solution".
That's how it can be joined with the Deka-Ban assembly, it's still the future music.
The second weekend of Octoberfest was known as "Italian Week End"
It's the first, Luca's third or fourth time.
Now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so it's all different, says Luca.
Following them, the Caiser's march is a strong body-shirt man, and it proves about 200 people who travel in Octoberfestre that they can predict the deep sounds from the battle.
Elena gets Luca's face first, and then he's kicking him.
They came from the problem to Veron.
In there, the Puorta New paleaudvar roomed from the parking bus four bus starts at 23.45 hours "Destination Monaco, festa della Birra" road target, will be previewed at 6.30 hours.
Three bus are mainly the Italians, but in the fourth are only the Brazilian roads.
In one of the parking rooms, the South Americas have already fallen down to their shipping, they have already started celebration during the evening.
And it's so sounding that it's not for the Italians, he says Marcoguard.
The buss are in the owner of Marco, who drives a long, smoking box and a wide, silver or gold.
Five years ago, the Octoberfester was organized only three ways for the time.
It's night there, in the day of October, at 22.30.
It's just a large expression, says Marco.
The road of 75 euros, this includes the Caiser's welcome in accordance with the law of the bad officers, the insurance and the German linguish management - a German influence in Marco Frankfurt.
And the buss are already in the night in the car "Brennero" direction.
No, no, no, no.
The bus's going fast, the travels are sleeping.
It's okay, they're still gonna need them.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are many Italian buses in the 8th car, where there is a short break before Munchen.
When Marco's group arrives at the nearby park of Theresienwiese according to the plan, there is about 50 other bus that has been made from Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has a last reporter, he knows the war.
First, everybody take the smoke.
On the left hand, "Octoberfest" is readed with the fracturer characters, including the Internet address of Marco travel office: "concersiviaggiando.it".
The second time, "When you're opening the shoe door, you're running," he cries in Marco tomorrow.
"Four!" Building places found in the back of the tent and the tent.
"Don't forward, because we're going to go, and not on the same paths, all the smokes are sitting, but we're going to shoot the room in the tent."
The unilateral board is running 8.25 euro, commanding Marco.
And don't forget the shooter.
"Speak the security officers that they're done well!
As you leave the places, they're busy."
Third times, "It's half-eighten, you'll be here again!"
And it's a way to Wesn.
In the middle of one man's traveler, he attached smokes to the tree, the tables, and also one of the bigger people's choice.
You need to be prepared for the return.
This is the second weekend of Octoberfest, known by the name of "Italian weekend".
There are no exact numbers; they speak about 500,000 people who passed through the Alpo in the fields, 10 percent of all his visitors from Italy, at the end of the week.
The Munchen police strengthens seven south-turoli police, Italian selfish people help the Bajor Red Cress, which are in national statistics of about 200 medical exhibition of the Italians, with the first place of the islands (e.g. 80) and the low-limited brits (c. 60).
In the area of the Italians, the Hofbree's officer was particularly pleased.
Nothing night for Hypo Real Estate
The German bank system has been stealing, and Peer Steinbrück's Communities Minister only last week.
It is also happy that the political has used the word "firstly" and that it is still said that the German bank sector does not refer to the crisis developments.
Because this week's in the end.
The Munchen Hypo Real Estate (HRE) reported Daxon has received billion credits from the consorcium of German banks to protect himself against the market turbulency.
One of the persons who had known the situation a weekly sent to Reuterss to driving 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must be paid after the required part.
In part of the money, it originates from the internal parts.
The Depfa girl's daughter's losses in the back.
Depfa, which concluded state finances, gave a long-term newspaper for long-term projects, and she refinanced himself at a short time - that is not possible now because of the insurance on the markets.
In the first time of 2008, the bank was reduced to 2,37 million euros with 95 percent of the bank, and its own capital also was measured to 1,6 percent of 1,45 percent.
The resources of the river enterprises and funds are returned to zero in the same period of the previous year, from the approvals and determined values, and more than 70% reduction of 5 million euros.
Only higher investments originated from the final recovery costs of the Depfa Group, and the reduction of the cuts in accordance with the competent regulation and the businesses that have been carried out for the consumption undertakings were not achieved in 16%.
After the privacy in 1990, the state financer was specialized with an unemployment investment, which later occurred in the Aeral Bank.
Since the classic state financing could be seen, Depfa was stronger in the infrastructure projects, as well as self-investors and the common country projects (private public partnership, PPP), and internationally deployed its activities.
For the value of the girls' companies, Hypo Real Estate must now be fulfilled by the descriptions that are "legal effects" to the results of the group - usually communicated.
It's true that it's not happening.
The party was already reduced to the third to 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has changed a significant state and infrastructure financer since the Depfa transmitted.
More than other financial institutions depends on the refinancing of the bank market, since it does not take account of customers.
The American Lehman Brothers investment bank has paid a trust between the banks two weeks ago, because banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about 50 billion euro refinancing tools for a short period.
According to the Hypo Real Estate community, the group financing requirements have been held for a period of faith, and the company has been protected "the impact of international financial in the present large measure".
Other resources are grateful for the money to be ensuring the refinanciation until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the HRE, reported that the Hypo Real Estate group should not be required to take the financial markets.
The German Communities Bank and the Federal Service Surveillance (BaFin) see that the Hypo Real Estate group has already been ensuring.
This gives hope to the bank participants and creditors.
But some can't be in it because of the dinamic and increasingness of the crisis.
It is not even unreasonable that it is not necessary to take the financing in full.
But this contrast can't be locked out.
After the Saturday evening news, the bank still stayed on the road, even saving to the equation couldn't be quiet.
The amount of participation was to be reduced by 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
Instead of this, you will be able to keep your own bonds.
While the data on the first place changes, the results of the reimbursement of the reimbursements have been significantly reduced.
The crisis, especially the previous girl's company, Württemberg Hypo connections and available for the long-term year 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate has already seen special investment alternative, their assessments must now be dependent on the stability of the International Financial System and in the case that the finance has been brought to the Depface's house at least.
Still, until the letters, governments and less dangerous business banks are prepared to support the system, they can be removed from the clearing of the restrictions to the limits of travellers.
Or there is no one to hope that the financial crisis will succeed in the next 15 months.
However, reports relating to the detailed statement, however, seeing a limited probability with certainty, has now developed a right hope in the desert.
For long-term credentials, the decision may be amended by their investment.
The short-term investors, however, may use the sale to make the contents of the data paid after the expenses of the next year.
Sylvana and the box secret
When Sylvana Hiltrop has to be shown in Tachibana Highschool on the first school day, girls begin to fight: The German girl has been "kavai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the Manca - you're talking about the new Czeredian blog in Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I've been very disgusting.
I was in the way to school.
I live in the Tokio street, to Kavaški, and 40 minutes in the Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, I didn't make it lucky.
It seems that the beginning of his teaching in Tachiban is not serious as home, in Also-Shailand.
The students begin to find out from eight hours until 8 hours at 40 hours a short conversation with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the teaching started, I had the line to show it.
But I'm not the guy who speaks in heart, especially before a 40-year-old class.
Because I wasn't yet my school innerruth, I took a old room from my officer, and I took him a blue, blue ring, and a black branch.
I stood in this garment, so I stood before the cat, and I tried to guess all right: "Sajonara, woe or Sylvana..." - I came from Germany, and after a week my birthday will be called Sylvana.
In this moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years.
All the 31 girls were suggested, enemies and enemies, and I continued to hear the word "kavai".
I've already known this from my hands.
This Japanese girls are the basic kids, and it means "fuki, sweetie."
Then I went to my place quickly.
The girl who sits in my neighbor was a wide moved, and she felt honoring that she was sitting at the clerdian.
The middle part of the hour was too quiet, but when he talked to the smile, they were regularly broken.
Everyone spoke and rejoiced, and with their questions the challenges were cut off, but it is hard to understand Japan’s English.
At the time, everybody's cut off his box.
My veterinary also made me such a feeding -- it's entirely different than the unclean Germanians.
I got a smooth riez, a little colbs, a bullshit, a shooter, a fruit and a piece of meat in the tofu.
I don't know what I eat in Japan.
The foods look amazing, and they're totally renewable.
It's true that everything's very good.
Oh, yeah, maybe outside the soil cycle, brarr.
In Japan's schools, it's not just a drink.
Before a girl offers a child’s handmaid gift, which is especially employed, in the hope that he can be considered closer to the child in the wedding.
I've read this in my images.
I'm asking if I can watch this here.
"Why then Japan?" my friends asked when I told them I wanted to go in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
"Cause he's just cutting."
Finally, I'm reading the most smooth manages since years.
And that the pictures and the cultures in them I'm better understanding, when I started learning Japan.
It was completely clear for me that I have to walk sometimes here.
Because I'm driving to the ship and the shoes.
And they're in a big ticket here.
Finally, Japan is the most recent technical and trend countries, and the other is low, guarded and traditional.
And because everybody's organized, I never felt lost myself, even if Tokio is the greatest city I saw in my life."
They've got the feelings of the pockets.
A pack or a moly dangerous case, does that mean that you feel fear?
Joseph LeDoux's neurological scientist is convinced about it: they have the feelings of animals.
But how can you examine whether he feels the same when they act like us?
New scientists have published their articles since years of internet.
The SPIEGEL ONLINE is in one of the series, "What is real, unless you can prove?" the answers came to the question.
I believe that the animals are made with feelings and other scientists, without that I or anyone else could prove it, and it is true that we can't still prove that we have knowledge of other people.
However, in this case, we can at least hope that all human minds are the same.
However, as we examine other trees, and the feeling or generally, we have the questions of knowledge, we are hard to go to the ground, because hardver does not eat.
When a pump is in danger, he dos the same as many other animals: he makes himself dead, without your way or injury.
People act in a similar way that some investigators have resulted in subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure are difficult to bring our own suspects to the animals.
In the case of the human knowledge, the fields are almost always contained the prefrontal demand of the site (for the reminder of the short-term memory and implementation and management functions).
This wide area in the case of humans is higher than the other main growth, and it seems to be totally increasing for other animals.
At least our knowledge of the aspectus that depends on the prefrontal brain, it knows who we are, or if we are planning and decision capacity, can be advised that the person is still from the majority of others.
Another dramatic property is hidden in human language: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, they often suggest that it depends on your knowledge.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even though it does not depend on the language of knowledge, the language would be certain, so that animal knowledge, which is likely, is likely to be different from most of our knowledge.
That is why it is difficult to be determined in the case of other animals.
If the knowledge is not able to meet inside and subjective things, and because of our own experiences, it is not possible to fix us to serious problems.
Most of my smoking is the content of knowledge, but there is also another aspect of knowledge that is probably easier to approach science.
The animals should be examined without awareness of the contents of the animals, and it is exactly in the case of experiences relating to a short-term memory, in particular in the example of visualization.
However, in the case of this case, Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it is more important to support the knowledge’s internal connections than to the commercial mechanisms: both can be the same, or not.
In the meaning of this area, the prefrontal cerebral importance of the importance of vizualization.
What's going on from this?
I'm going back to this, that an emotional system, such as the fear, will be activated in the brain that is clean with its own activities.
What we are called "bearing" is the mental state in which we are when the operation of the system of protection in the mind (or the consequences of it, for example, the body reactions).
Thus, the feelings are closely associated with the areas of the cerebral, which are mainly related to humans.
In addition to the language mark, the feelings are fulfilled, because we are able to distinguish and category with words and language helping us.
For example, Antonio Damasio is in the opinion that the feelings are originating from the easier activities of the cerebral and the brain-screen areas, just as Jaak Pankseep, which is more concentrated on the brain.
Since this network has not been very changed in human evolution, it can easily play a role in the feelings of the trees.
I don't know that I can't do this, but I'm keeping it unbelievable.
Pankseep thinks that what seems to be afraid of patkins and people is likely both of them: How can you check if the packs and people feel the same when they act like that?
Unless a little bit goes in danger, is she feeling a fear?
I think that the same action was not yet proved to the same.
Although the neural comparison helps further: the packens and people are like the brain, but they do not have any brain.
But the brain's responsibility for the feelings?
And even if these people could be proved: how can we prove this in the case of the pockets?
I think it's for the pockets and the other emergency, but maybe there's also the girls (who knows?) feelings.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And because their feelings are essentially different from ourselves (as human knowledge based on special areas and languages), the emotional action of patents as I consider emotional feelings.
However, death in this field is increasing to the neural levels, as we measure the same as the patkins and people.
As I don't know the language and knowledge in the case of the pockets, I don't know if they're looking for it.
Others may seem to be a short-term approach, but I'm going to be able to be able to steal the walls.
Because I'm a practical emotional.
Platini, President of the EUFA: Internal time for English and Ukraine
Ivan Vasjunik reported the President of the Ukraine that the preparations are submitted to the presidency and the Ministry's direct responsibility.
"In the decision of the EUFA bordeaux, the Government sees confidence and evidence that they believe that Ukraine may be commonly possible to establish the European Democracy," said Vasjunik.
"But this doesn't mean an empathy for our country.
It's just started, and in both countries there's a lot of tennis."
Station, roads, hotels and aircrafts are in the development of both vendor countries.
Maybe the number of EB stations will be reduced from eight hours.
"We don't have more time.
"We have to work with hardness now," said Grigory Surkis, President of the Ukraine Labdar Conference.
"The EUFA will continue to keep our eyes."
In England, they were still intended to step more radically.
After a number of boards, the National Olimpian Commission declined the leadership of the PZPN covenant that Robert Zawlocki was sure to change an independent overseer.
The Commission was initiated by Miroslaw Drzewick Sport Minister.
"The serious danger that PZPN can't work according to rules" explained Drzewicki to the PAP officer.
"We have confirmed Michel Platinit, the President of the EUFA, that it will not affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
Only in the past time, the first group had to be manipulated in the bottom class, and finally the connection start had to be restored.
The defenced Dennis Quaid returns
The master wanted to figure a new film, he talked about the self - and now he had the problem with her husband, and Ryan's Hollywood star's married marriage, Dennis Quaid.
He who secrets and turns back
The battle of Ross of Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex marriage: The two hollywood colors are seven years after their wills, we have a lot of battle each other - before publicity.
And Ryan, in the interview of the American Instyle travellers last week, explained first about the devotion, "Dennis was unfaithful to me with many pains."
Just after the release, she knew how much Dennis was with her.
The spirit striptis Ryan new, the film of "Women" film, has been traced by a row of a marriage story.
Dennis Quaid has decided to react to the exclamation of an unfair marriage: "Sorry" - the 54-year-old colorist of the New York Daily News, - "come it repeats and transmits the story of our relationship."
Moreover, it's "health" that 16-year-year-old boys, Jack, again, "recommendedly remember many pains and changes that a child's redeeming."
While Ryan lived alone, Quaid was raised again, and recently became his father.
That is why it will be said by the next page: "My life will continue.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything's the greatest."
The prices of airports and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first time of 2008, the European airports and the destinations were higher than in the previous year.
A current study says that the aircrafts were not less than 50 percent.
The airports and the hotel prices have become more favorable, so the result of one of the American Express traveling and financial services.
The company issued the data of employment on the first time 2008, and after the first fourth area, it was established a significant trade in the second fourth year.
After the prices were raised up for years in the hotel market, many hotels have become more lowly.
Through January and March, the prices of 48 European cities were increasing 6,9 per cent in 2007 in 41 European cities.
However, in the period of April until June, the lower prices of 3,6 per cent were achieved than in the previous year.
This trend was shown in Paris and Rome where the vendors had to pay less than one year ago.
This is the case of American Express in the low bill of dollars that "the American tourists led to the traveling travel."
The reduction of hotel rooms is more interested in financial centres, such as Frankfurt or London, as the industry, for example Hannovert, Kölnt or Stavangert.
In the northern city, 26,3 per cent of hotels are the European records.
In the first fourth year, the amendment on the prices of the aircraft has also been shown in the first fourth year.
Because of the cherozin treatment, the travellers had to pay more than 7,1% of the tourist class than in 2007, and the long-term airports were treated with 29,2%.
Through April and June, 12,5 per cent of tourist aircraft prices were reduced to the previous fourth year, the business and the first class showed only better changes.
In Germany, the prices were increasingly increased than in other European countries.
Through January and March, the prices were 11,9 percent, and the second fourth year was reduced by 23,6 percent.
The price of German internal airports was reduced to the top of the study.

The swing-by means the gravitation hints of the cycles, which makes a Egyptian, for example in the Earth Gravitation Area.
So the solars can make a large quantity of business materials.
The European American Cassini-Huygens also used this physical market as well as the Ulysses day.
However, the investigators have been carried out for years: Airlines are not fully conducted as they would be expected on the basis of the original gravitation law.
It's a lot of standards in the speed.
The shoes are unexpected or unexpected.
Physicians have not always found an explanation for this efficiency.
The present was crucified by an anomaly swing-by.
Some experts say that maybe even Albert Einstein's general relationship nature can not be completely located, which will reach the substance as the ground greenhouse.
Stephen Adler American physicist, the princeton Institute for Advanced Study worker, continues to believe in him that Einstein did not threaten, and the Swing-by anomaly trys to explain the same dark substance which the ships were held in the universe.
"The anomaly can be responsible for the dark substance, which may be found in the whole near Earth," adds Adler.
On the setting of the dark substance, the light-builders had only ten years of knowledge.
Obviously, a gravitation force that can observe the effect of other Egyptians.
However, the substance is totally invisible or non-visible, especially visible light does not excuse or turn back.

The Truroi criminal court has been known that he has regularly attached his officer, Stephanie Randle between his five-week and weekly.
Trerise wrote, "I'm going to feel right for the fish."
On the negotiation, Randle, 34 years old, was a murderer in the fourth Mutley city in the house of Plymouth City on 1 April 2007.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise touched her eyes before the communities, while her mother worked in a hook.
Trerise was separated from his wife in 1980, and he chose Cornwall again in his apartment.
She's driving up to Plymouth.

Important data were placed under the officers of losses
According to the BBC notifications, the official secretary of the Government Authority, which has forgotten secret documents in June, is injury.
The man's experts were in the sentence of the Hospital Minister when he left two secret documents on a Waterloo line.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This law is more lower than the weight of the law, and it does not stand out of the purpose of the proceedings.
Frank Gardner, a Scientific Ministry of the BBC, says that many steps were surprised in Whitehall.
"I thought the office minister and the Government will handle the case."
The application that cannot be named has been based on paragraph 8.1; this paragraph is about maintaining information.
The State Agency proposed that the representative of the Metropolitan Police of the Metropolitan Police has taken the advice against the officials of the United Kingdom for a sensitive, sensitive work of the United Kingdom.

Accommodations are paid by B&amp;B
The newspapers of the British residents can be calculated for a total number of 80 million English sources after saving the Bradford & amp; Bingley bank.
The Government costed 14 billion fonts 2.6 million accounts for the protection of the investments located by Bradford & amp; Bingley.
It will pay all the company that uses the money of the investors, also a 59-year-old text in the middle of them.

Finally, to return to 14 billion currency, Bradford & amp; will be returned after the refund of Bingley's signs.
However, 700 financial enterprises in the period are raised by an annual period.

It is amazing that the processing institutions have been able to pay the accounts of the institutions which were goodly less advisory.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that all enterprises should be paid in such a reason, and it is a quote in the birth, and the companies are shared in 18% of the costs.
According to the Financial Ministry, the amount of credits will have 450 million sources in 2009.
This means that 81 million fonts of society should be able to be able to pay the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director of the officers of the habitatory society, said to the BBC that he keeps the measure injustice.
"The fighter that the institutions need to pay the numbers of less precautionary institutions that have been driving around the time of the shipping market."
The BSA says that there was no company to destroy since they started their operation in 1945.
"We need to examine this case in the next few weeks to deal with how we can protect the resident companies and members from the significant account," he said to Cole.
In 2009, the ship was cut down 7 months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, a total year-camate shall be paid, which can also be double-timed.
Since the officers, without partial organisations, the Member States shall finally pay the account, as well as in the higher costs, or through the lower ships received after their costs.

According to the sciences, although in terms of a free schedule was placed for a foreign health, the free feet conditions are not clearly clearly to protect the freedom when it returns to the country.
Agency says that it will now be attached to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Justice.
"The jurisdiction advised Sheikh Hasina's request to notice that it is not necessary, because it has already been placed freely, and it is part of a foreign medicine," we knew of the lawyer Rafique Huq.
"We're going to steal against the judicial decision."
According to the Auditors, it is therefore necessary to protect the freedom to return to the country and to prepare the elections of December.
Awami League was a party of his leader on Monday told Sheikh Hasina to go home after October 17.
Afterward, Tavaly was carried into a guard that a temporal government supported by the military was transmitted the power, but in June, they were released from the prison to be able to be carried outside.

Research of the American Agency Agency
The main state officer of the United States was called a special agent for the investigation of the 9 United States Agency of 2006.
The step concluded that the reporting criteria made by the Director of Justice on the case by the Governing Board.
The report has judged the officers of the White House, the law officials, and the ultimate officer Alberto Gonzalest.
The investigation was made because it was afraid that the state agencies were lost from political development.

"The potential crimes have not yet been examined, and they haven't been cleaned" - set Glenn Fine, main supervisor.

The series started that in December 2006, nine state officers were removed from the United States Justice Office.
At the same time, they said that the State Agency had been sold for their fulfillment.
However, later, it was explained that the transported state officers had no worst evaluation than many other colleagues, and that many had been concluded that political recognition after the removals had been reached.

Meat Loaf is able to recognize
The rockster Meat Loaf will recognize the Q Awards detailed gate for the "Bat Out Of Hell" episode of the "Bat Out of Hell".
The song who takes a special golden price in London's celebration in the next week, he said that he keeps honor of the recognition.
The nine minutes, 50 seconds length Dal Meat Loaf, in 1977, was the department of the actor of the community.
Coldplay has received most marks to the time, four categorys have been attached to the selected list.
Paul Rees, the Q magazine principal editor, said, "There's some of the branches that's over the time or the officers, and the "Bat Out Of Hell" is such."
Jim Steinman made a lot of sound, and this sound was Meat Loafé.
The wall started with a two-percent sound smoking.
In 1979 it is signed as a small disk, and the blind lists came to the 15th place.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was only nine years in the blind list, and then more than 40 million examples were given to him.
Meat Loaf - the real name of Marvin Lee Aday - now fights with health care problems. More of them, because of the heartritism in 2003, he moved to operate after he assembled on the color.
In 2007, some concerts had to be spoken.
Afterward, it's discovered that it's a lot in the sound room.
Unknown grandfather street which often forget, and maybe they're soon sold
New York City has more than thousands of sugars, circuits and other annexes. Some of them are notified, others are filled with practical functions.
However, many practical taxishops and a long-term location here would be hard to tell you where the extra Place is found, too much because they never heard about it.
The little street is in East Village, and it's on the north of the first street - without coming to the second street - between Bowery and the Second Sugar.
9 m width and 36 m length, and much more similar to a poor sicator than to a main travelway.
There's no travel tables.
It is usually not possible to find a standard map.
But the street's wonderful.
There's, for example, the Avalon Bay, the builder of the first Luxembourgs in the recent building.
She wants to build extra Place again, and you want to ensure that the new building's businesses and buckets are going to a cleaner way.
The street wonders are in the middle of the towns of the longer here, which have taken in the hot streets, that it was the only rest of the area before the refrigeration of the environment.
However, the owner of the street, the town's structure and development class is not in the interest of it.
In this month, on a meeting of the Court of Agricultural Government, the city and the representatives of Avalon Bay were introduced a proposal for which the manufacturer would increasing the street.
However, the Commission wants to be better if the street remains in the treatment of the city and requests a new plan in the future month, Susan Stetzer, the officer of the ownership body number 3.
"It's a very little area in the city's birth, and we want to, if the extra Place continues to stay in the city," he said.
"There may come to the proposals for the refrigeration and treatment, which can implement the Avalon, but we also want to ensure that it is available for publicity."
Avalon Bay has stated that he wanted to build the street again and wants to see the rooms. These are a part of a coffee, which will give the building a range to the structure.
The idea of what the Avalon Bay would spread out the street, first the air seat was brought to publicity.
Michele de Milly, the Avalon Bay dictionary said that if the company wants to use the street, it doesn't take care of the birth.
"The Avalon Bay's the first point is to explore this destroyed shirt, and to show a nice public location," he explained, in addition to that the city recommended its destruction.
Seth Donlin, the officer of the Construction Iroda said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and he noted that the office's job was to develop the buildings, and not the hand.
To your colourful neighborhood, Bowery's image is not a lot of history.
Some say that in 1802, the name of the "unknown land" was called when Philip Minthorne was divided a large steel between his unexpected child, and no one had a vow on the middle town.
In 2006, the CBGB's back-out was opened to Extra Place, and the street may be the best that it was prepared by the Ramones "Rocket to Russia" album.
"He was a good place," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who made a photograph in November 1976.
"He had meet with eye, scarlets, hordes and potters, and with walls and obligations."
Some inhabitants, more of the bloggers who write how he took the Middle East Village, contrary to the extra Place. They want to remain in the community.
Others refer to extra Place as a ridicule that the city remains in a regularly unchanged stay, and which must leave peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the "Jeremy's missing New York" address ("The Syralmak book: the browsing of the city's proceedings of the proceedings of the city"), has received a blog of the story about Extra Place, which refers to the weekly "The New Yorker" address in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a little scarlet, which is still dark in the sun, which is the dark, which is made by white tents and spread windows, and where the wind is able to bring some news in the cancers."
The street, out of some exceptions, looked like a few nights ago.
A packing rolled on the end of the street, next to the back door that was led to the CBGB, and now it is a higher steel clothing bottle.
It was graffiti in the walls, and an empty, 0.75 liter branch branches cut down a smooth, fresh newspaper.
Some travellers told us that we're going to get the extra Place, but they think they're going to get the refrigeration.
Fields told him that he thinks some of the streets are under the current state of the street.
"I've eaten the best years of darkness, white and amazing places," he said.
Vita about the double education: continuous expansion of the English environment
In this part, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi are considered the opinion of a two-second education.
Lance T. Izumi, who studied researchers in the Czend Ocean Central Policy Institute of California Study and the manager of educational research, is the book manager "Not as well as you think: why you need to select the school options?"
It's not easy to go to voters from Spanish language areas.
Barack Obama's proposals are also included here.
Obama's campaign says, "Afro American and Spanish high school students have a majorly smaller probability than the white dicks," and that's true.
In view of these different differences, Obama is explicitly supporting Obama's training plan - among others - the "recommended double training" for English students.
In addition, Obama is the question that the duplicate training of education, which places in non-English school education, is an interest in the achievement of great compliance requirements.
Let's take for example the general school of the Sixth Street Prep Treaty on the east part of Los Angeles.
The largest part of the school students is Spanish and low future.
The students learn more than one third of those who have come recently in English.
Instead of this, 100% of the fourth class has resulted in the state's mathematical visa in 2008.
It is likely that the fourth class is 93% of the 93% of the English language and office.
This unbelievable implementation does not take account of the device that Obama would share before.
The Sixth Street places the sound level to repeat, treatment, continuous evaluation of the preparations and reduction of exemptions.
Moreover, and this is what Obama should take care of, Linda Mikels, manager of Sixth Street, the school education of English students, "increasing full valuation" in the language environment.
The meaning of the interpreting method is to use at least simple use in the other subjects.
"We've been achieved to enter a class, and we wouldn't know who was the dick who came from Mexican for 12 months ago."
"It's working." "We don't work."
Would Obama be able to set up the other, important number of Spanish and English school students in schools like the Sixth Street Prep?
The school needs to be clear to make the answer, however, because of its own party's education policy (the United Nations Students are so long supporting the double education), and because they are finally exhausted with the double education, we can not be sure in Obama’s reaction.
Although they have to learn English, Obama recently explained about the question when he said that people should not be so worried about the law "only English".
Instead, he said, "There should be capable of talking to their children in Spanish."
If Obama really wants to be able to reduce the differences between the results, he should really study the models that are working instead of looking and bringing them to nothing.
Economic, renewed concerns, the price of the oil was carried out
In the week-of-shirts, the oil prices are concerned because the American financial markets will not be able to increase the economy.
Seven percent of the currency papers are returned back to 99,80 dollars before the New York's Kereskedelmi Federation.
The prices were reduced for more than 20 dollars since last week.
During the past two weeks, Wall Street's Financial Railway was cutting in the field of Mexico, and several powerful aircrafts in the Mexican area.
After the prices were calculated in July as $145,29, at the beginning of this month, I would return at least 90 dollars before the effect of the increasing independence of financial markets would be reached.
Wednesday, the concern made the investors again, even after that the congress leaders were reported: the weekend had been able to conform the economic resources that were the most important in the history.
The news have been able to reach the worries, since the financial crisis will not end for a long time.
As the most recent events of the exhibition crisis, the Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation Bank business, reported the Government weekly.
In time, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have established the European Financial Consolidation, Fortis.
According to the elements of Barclays Capital, the results of the weekend-end agreements "and it seems to be able to exceed the trade welfare of the officers."
As the economic situation is declined, it may be expected that the purchases — for example, the oil search will also reduce.
"The future of the tribes, the stones, and the future of the market of the currency of the currency" - Deutsche Bank wrote an element for the investors.
"We're thinking we're not going to get the market of the rabbits.
The most important question is how the United States "behaviour" causes the whole world, especially regarding China."
As a result of economic growth reduced the oil pollution, banks were reduced from their expectations for the future year, reduced by 20% of their properties for oil and gas 2009.
With the second quarter bravour of the team set
After the past more than eight in the Jets field, Shaun Ellis believed that he had seen everything.
But then he looked at the second fourth exhibition on Monday when Jets changed a game without a point.
"I've never seen this," said Ellis.
After the second fourth, Jets and Arizona Cardinals started to be completely consistent with the sky Turiosolon, the dark clouds.
Brett Favre, quarterback 12-yard touchdown-past to Laveranues Coles. This was a perfect pre-found for a lunch, which has increased significantly their cooperation.
Favre gave two touchdown pasts to Coles in this fourth, among others, when two cornerbacks after each other were 10 seconds before the time end.
"I'm not sorry about the suffering," said Favre about all Coles' pasts.
"It's a good player.
We could also communicate together, unlike what people think."
While Favre and Coles were launched, the protector stopped the Cardinals manager, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, playing in the cornerback position, took a bad ball, and returned with 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player entered into another stick, and got his lab.
David Bowens, the linebacker had been cut off Warner's hands.
This last translation could be moved to the most scale in the measurement.
However, when the Cardinals lost his lab, 10 seconds before the end, and Jets was achieved, Jay Feely's 20-year-year-old field, he set the results of 34:0.
That was the best result that Jets had been in a fourth.
When you assume the Jets' officer, Eric Manginit to identify the game's detail, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in the third fourth Cardinals made 21 points that Jets did not make one - Mangini said, "I need to say that the second four was much more pleasant than the third.
We had a lot of points under a short time."

In the past month, Gerselassie left the pekingi olimpian maratot from that - that may be a surprise of the surface - that the air pollution would be more severe asthmatic problems.
He's incoming to Berlini's maraton.
Only between perfect circumstances - in the daytime, in the beginning of 9 °C, and at the end in 13 °C - winning Gerselassie on Sunday, unbelievable, 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since Maratono wasn't traveled, such as Gerselassie, and the Kenya Paul Tergat turned to the longer streets, the maratoni record was reduced more than two minutes in the past year since Brazil Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 at 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the wedding gain, Gerselassie told the reporters that he had two weeks ago thrown up his two feet, and he couldn't be raised for two weeks.
Obviously, it was refreshed under the driving, and it wasn't raised.
"I'm so glad," said Gerselassie to the reporters.
"It's all done perfectly.
I started again a week ago, and I was in doubt today, but finally everything was fine."
Some critics have been taken from Kenya, especially from the Eastern Africa Rivaly - because they use too many shipping devices in the conventions, generally getting many worldmarked maraton footballs, and let them run as if it runs on the ground, and the world records are located before the concurrence.
However, this criticism is a lot to reduce the greatness of Gerselassie in the long-term flow.
Gerselassie on Monday, four cocktail drimps were referred to under 1:02:04.
Two living cheese fuses, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave the ritmus to Gerselassie after the ramps were broken.
Not much more than 4,8 miles before the target Gerselassie left Kwambai with a last print, which was the second goal at 2:05:36, 5 minutes to be the best.
Kamathi entered as the third under 2:07:48.
In the convention of the women, Irina Mikitenko, who is now German, closed a year to the seventh quickest winter, 2:19:19.
The British Paula Radcliffe contains at 2:15:25.
With the past trial of 36 years of Mikitenko wind the result of London Maraton 2:24:14.
The pekingi olimpian is not deprived, however, he was quickly healed and opened the berlin maratot, where five minutes have been replaced. This was the third maratoni refugee that he shared.
Intelligent calculation, he first allowed Ethiopia and Kenya to prepare a fourth major group, and to make a significant leader, and then after 30 km after they escaped.
The Ethiope Askale Tafa Magarsa has been a second goal since 2:21.31, while the Kenya Helena Kiprop has become the third result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, black honour and temptations
In the Greater Orlando, a part of a few fields of fields from all that are crying, sound and powerful - are a great little girl where African life has been born honour and bonodality.
Eatonville, the first pure black city that was integrated in the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, today is not as simple as in 1935, "the five cars, three cross-shirts, 300 barna branches, 300 good shirts, great guests, and two schools, without prison."
Now I'm going to shoot the room.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already gone to Zora's feast at the year. The Etonville's feast of the Harlem-Renesan's highest woman's writer, Hurston's honor.
However, of many points, the cities described and touristic literature, which are also part of the Florida's traveling of the project of the Criminal writer of the Criminal Court.
Like the 1930-year-year-old, it was the same independent and closer, when Hurston wrote the Floridaians, the citizens often did not share their real thoughts with the white people who "they know so little about us that they don't know what they remain."
Even in the year, when the Black President has chosen, Barack Obama is openly surprised to the faji question, many are intrusted in the respect of its moments of strangers.
"We'll be careful about how they say our story," the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here in the whole life, and the member of the city's biggest house.
"You have to tell me clearly."
Eatonville has a long time identified my winning and battle paradoxon.
Once the history of black calls is an important model, however, only 2400 major community where poverty demonstrators reach the country's average duplex.
In the case of the officer, in part, the American rab service results were created, sometimes appeared, sometimes, for glory, south, cities, black culture, which is in the fields of the fields.
So it's not surprised that the habitats are honorable and protective one time.
And the image of Eatonville is important since Zora, (all called Hurston).
The real, strong dialect writes in the books - as the "Mules and Men" (1935) and the "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - showed the birth of the world.
The Florida Road Book transformed the city to be near the 17th road. This road led Florida from the centre of the black history and human drums to one of the colors.
Hurston, who was a lot in life and office, either the bathroom, introduced his readers in Eatonville's first citizens, Joe Clarke's business, and then was insured in the most confident shoes.
So he wrote, "We find the modern public school on the right hand, with a white white shekel on the barna base, with awareness with rooms and players who are concerned about Howard Miller, although you can write and read."
He told the new husband of the widow Dash, and he wrote that Lee Glenn was "all of the threat of drinking, and whatever you can need in the transitional oils."
Thus, in some hundred words, he brought Eatonville to the autonomy, but even with the writelessness, the refraction and the sex.
It's clear that the Fodor's travel was shown in.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora said the things like they were," he numbered the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who would have done Harston's unbelievable way to make them dead from the smoking towns that the men were singing about their beauty.
You said, "This guy didn't like some."
Hurston's still remembered as the alive separate who often went home after his family came to Jacksonville.
The 77-year Augustus Franklin stated that when Hurston entered into the city, he often came in a robbery Chevrolet, cigaretted, and in a long-term city where people still are honoured to their precious clothing.
The majority of the people have been disappointed, Franklin said, but many have been fixed.
"The people were always happy if they could see Zora," said Franklin.
However, the Sabelia tower, where he was baptized with the greatest probability of Hurston, added to him in the room, "I've remained too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were not given again.
It seemed that the world had forgotten Eatonville with the great part of the world.
Although he had ever been a popular writer, Langston Hughes, and the only black woman in Barnard Primescole in 1920, he was able to enter into the floor of Florida's Fort Pierce, where he lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no significant memories, or large, public readings.
"I don't think they have understanded how much he has increased the world, or whatever he left us," said Valerie Boyd, the book of the book "Burcoled in the Office" in 2003.
The movement point came in 1980.
The Orange's officers wanted to build five paths through the city, in place of Kennedy's sugar, which was a important role in the community's life.
Orlando has already been able to attach the states with the Interstate 4 cars on the west side of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still fed after a hard history period.
In addition, the end of this integration has been concluded by the Community increasingly ideal separation.
In 1950, wars relating to faji destruction were condemned with the Community to hate.
"It's been a white boy at the same time, and they've made them sitting on the street with the nancy and other things," said Franklin.
"I had a lady who died in him.
They've got a Greek ring out of a car."
In a letter of the The Orlando Sentinel, in 1955, Hurston asked the decision to predict the most strong integration of the courts. So she declared the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision: "It's more sensitive and no respect."
Today the residents say that the degree of schools was positive in some of the same areas, he broke up the etonvilles, and submitted a confidence of the young people.
"The black kids have tried to kill them - I remember that - the man killed his teacher in the morning and evening" in N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins, the nonprofit manager of the Officer of the Eatonville Community.
"This has been holding until the dicks and the teachers have gone out of the common place."
"We didn't kill our white teacher because he was a white teacher -- I mean, there were cultural differences among us," said Nathiri.
However, the human rights helped many other Zora Neale Hurston - in black writes, colors, and artists who were raised up in the provisions as he did, such as self-consciously and seriously as the following: "How can anyone be able to separate himself from my society's lives!
It's impossible for me."
In 1975 Alice Walker ran into Harston's unsigned sepulchre, and she started fighting to return the newsname.
Five years later, the bookshops came to the villages by a Robert E. Hemenway, known by Hurston's lives, who made it again among the American examples.
The road project would have gone when Eatonville's highest daughter was reached to the center of the observation.
And this time, the old partners of Harston were looking for him as a saving.
In 1988, the community began to organize a Hurston-festivo to show what he would destroy with the main line.
More than thousands of people have arrived to the open event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
A couple of years later, the plan has been reached from the proposal of the traveling.
"Because the main exploitation of the community was renewed, totally attached to the entire citizens' majesty," said Nathiri.
Boyd just announced, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
There are more than a number of lives outside the city, such as a lawyer Rachelle Munson who started walking here in 1993, and the locations began to review the past.
Eatonville was in 1998 in the national history record.
In 2006, the new, single, named from Harston, was opened in 2006, the re-burned and explored Kennedy sugar.
Eatonville continued to stay in Florida: not just 10 km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes there is a feeling that a strange additive would be at the time of the weather of the weather; as small as when the 27-year-old family was based in 1880.
(But 90%'s black.)
They still take care of the strangers whose story is Eatonville.
Most interviews are required, and some things - such as Eatonville’s highest frequency, which has set a white man and explore black workers on earth - is not free to photograph them.
In Eatonville, many - more of the self-secured Jones teacher, who is particularly attached to our parent - are afraid to be explored by their special community.
Yet, as the Hurston-festive has become more wide, the parent honor also grows.
Especially, the young men considered Eatonville, as he saw their own age: wonderful, and problems, and all of them are no better, not bad, the same glory, the creative, the poor, the crazy, the crazy, the crazy, and the other faji and ethnic groups in America.
In fact, the citizenship of Franklin's uncle, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey's words, who's planning to return after the main school, to work with the local own government or to the police, which they say that they are looking for help.
And it seems that the younger also learned to identify Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park's officer: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"The most people who just move here think that this city has nothing to do to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after the stay.
"But if someone stands and sets a little time to know the story, it's a very beautiful city."
We're here in New York, we're all talking about the language of the financial officers
There's nothing changed on the surface.
If the tourists wouldn't be concerned with the newspapers and the powerful television controllers in the Times Square, I wouldn't be sure that they are in the middle of a smoke.
They would never come to the fact that the bankers and risk managers of the bankers who keep the powers of New York, from 1929 eat the worst days.
The footballs are still cutting steams on the roads, sending balls with muffin to talk to the morning.
Still, Spanish mans are still smoking between the balls, a human sister of fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-fifty-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-s.
The officers are still in line for their master supply for the staying food, and still unable to take taxes between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel that there would be any situation to give up until I was struggle in the morning, and I didn't decide that I would open a new bank number.
The same way I was planning to make the thing in the JP Morgan Chase bank in the day of the lunch, however, 20 people stayed before me in the row.
Not on the bank-financial window where you can take or pay money, but by the customer's office, where old customers are able to carry a box, the tourists are requested to carry out the Macy's room, and where the new clients open the bank number.
Many before me -- I knew you later from Starr, from the banker, with the same purposes as me.
However, from me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their apartment, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money out of the boxes called (which is olympics such as inhabitant texts), the credit texts, and the smaller tax pigs that work only in a single country, and they handle their cases as a family member.
In the past year, 15 such banks were cut down.
Last days in Washington Mutual, a bank of $327 billion billion billion billion billion rate, and when the New Yorks entered home at the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, 440 billion billion billion dollars.
The officers and officers before me, with fear of a new distribution, they brought their money that seemed to be safe, to the bank which leads most capital injection in the Wall Street.
The simply New York people have been experienced in the financial cases for the past few weeks.
A woman talked about the Lehman Brothers bank and his powerful view manager, Dick Fuld, as if he had a loud colleague.
And Lyn, a single room of my apartment, has changed a taste problem for fifty years, not now about Brad and Angelin, or about my food equipment, as we did.
So he said to me after I went in the bank, "I sold all my money in money equipment.
I changed, you're not risking."
Muzulman's flowers were struggled while Australia was on the right side
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right side of Australian Freedom Party, and Philip Dewinter, from the Belgian Rights Party, from Vlaams Belang, participated in Antwerpen, on 17 January 2008, on the challenge of the office of the organisation of the Institute of Islam Treatment Ellen.
There were signs following such translation tables, which were broken by pitch lines.
According to the police, the extent right-boilding rates are responsible for the assessment of the Australian Musulman, which has occurred in the same week when the floor-jobbaldade parties have had significantly progressed in the country's elections.
More than 90 flowers have a serious smoking in the traunic secret of Linz, and they have spent between night and tonight.
The prosecutors were drawn by the Jews symbols, for example, David's stars, in some flowers, but, according to the detectors, they were just trying to hide their strong instructions that are disappeared from the hatred of the Muslims.
It is not clear that the incidence can be carried out in any way with the choices.
The local island community told a worder that it was not much before the end of Ramadan.
In addition, Austria has an examination of learning knowledge after the last Parliament's elections, in which the political language has been right.
The two flower-booble party that only 30% of the votes made for the Freedom Party and the Assembly of Austria has been campaigned for a strong income law, and some of their slaves have been able to cut out their criticism.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Liberty Party of more than 18% of the votes, continued the campaign against heads and bars, and completed the divorce with the islam with the foods that were able to be attached to the islam.
At the final, peaceful assembly of the party, he spoke about "European brotherness", which can be able to strengthen the islam.
Both parts are wanted to attach the building of ships and minerals to the political symbols of the communication in Austria and Europe in the process.
According to the directly investigations and opinions, the changes of the largest younger voting database were thanks to the future of their concerns in the European Union.
Garry Glitter's disappeared from a foreign travel.
Garry Glitter, the child's child's non-behaviour, has been condemned by the rockboard of the court disappeared from the French and Spanish travel.
The judges later decided to disappear by Glitter six months to notify his control authorities as they wanted to go through France to Spain.
The citizen policy has made a defense of the travel, after the court brought evidence against Glitter, the national courts related to children.
Glitter, a real name Paul Gadd, was not part of the city Ashford Magistrates, but the advocates of Corker Binning.
A jurisdictionary statement said: "On September 25, the citizen police requested the Ashford Magistrate Court of Paul Gadd to 25 March to France and Spain.
"Paul Gadd doesn't mean personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter reported the authorities about the purpose of foreign traveling, because it is committed to the law on the report of sexual crimes.
The authorities must be considered if more than three days are planning to walk outside.
It is also obligated to notify the police at least seven days before the schedule of exit.
If it does not not report the authorities, they may be judged to avoid freedom for five years.
The citizen police said they don't want to talk about the individual cases of glitter, and they're going to talk about the possibility of death.
We learned from the officer of the town police: "The town police will do everything in the protection of children within the country and outside.
"We hope that someone is easier to check if he does not leave the United Kingdom, because there is a transactional system to our provision that we can efficiently achieve potential risks.
"The city police maintains the most important task to protect Kent's inhabitants, and we continue to monitor the publication of sexual crimes and the conservation of lives in the field to minimize the residence concerned, essential risks."
In the past month, Glitter returned to the United Kingdom after 27 months in a Vietnam prison for a 10 - and 11 - year - old girl.
After his freedom, he flyed to Bangkok, where he had to go to London.
However, he said that he felt bad, and he wasn't going to London.
The field authorities were not allowed to travel through the travel investigation, so they were finally flying to Hong Kong.
In addition, the Chinese authorities were not allowed to enter into the country, so they returned to Bangkok, where the police of the field and the income officials were invited to return to the United Kingdom.
Finally, on 22 August, Heathrow airport was arrived to the 3th terminal, and he remained there until his lawyer David Corker went not to the west-London court, since the Court of ukbridge, according to the request of Scotland Yard, was taken into the publication of sexual crimes.
Litter has been carried out four months ago in prison for strengthening children in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a mini-minister source, Jacqui Smith, an indigenous State Stater accepted a pleasure that Glitter had not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not preparing photos on the color, because I want to show the artist from a personal page" Günther Bauer Photographer
There's no pigs, no footballs, no dance.
From the flamenco grandmesters near the body, without the shoes, to know the wedding face of the dances also.
It's a single artist.
Otherwise, the week-second man.
And these two pages can not be separated, except in the remote moments of the community, when we can eat a personal movement, we can take a depth of a captured spectacular, or we can cut out the arts that are prepared for the spectrum of the outstanding hands.
In the photography of German Günther Bauer Flamenco-pope, the teatrality of songs, dancings, and gitarians is the most known page of the masters.
Photos show the flamenco own icon graphy from various aspects.
The exhibition, part of the Flamenco Photography of the Monapo, "exclude the international importance of the day of the flamenco day" - is considered, in addition, that the Flamenco-people may be "management anybody, since the images see more monitoring that these images are not typically explored by the artists.
These people who have finished the street are artists who can make suffering, suffering, shame, smoking to the color path... and rabul to obey the community.
In the same time, the photography is not appropriate to explore their personality.
Their personality and their signs live most importantly.
I wanted to have an increasing amount of steel, which allows me to possess the personality of his flamenco grandfathers."
The Cante de Las Minas feeded a long way to Bauer in 1997, which produced ports with a photographer on flamenco songs, gitarians and dances.
This portree offers a classic photograph of the camera and the theme selection.
The use of various stylestic tools, however, distracts the remote images, and suggles modernity. The following thinking of Bauer's imagination of the flamenco: "This is a traditional wind that changes the day and always exceeds."
Not the dance, not the song or the music, much more than the artist's personality, the character of the community.
In the days of the El Photomata gallery, the manager of circumstances can be displayed with the relevant, the arteries of the artificial gas, which can be viewed through the feeling, the emotion and the display.
The flamenco known alakies, among others, Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, refers to a photo collection of six artists.
The project also changed a flamenco analogy, from which he rapidly carried out an album of the ports on the output.
Constructed by the portrait suffering two years to repeat the idea with the "Sportart Project" portrait "Sportart Project".
Although the Flamenco-people concept is a little far from this, the camera adds: "I love people to photograph, meet them and get them in a longer or shorter moment in their life.
I think I think it's the biggest picture of the port.
You'll meet people with the persons that you don't know sometimes, or they're just a few minutes to take the photography.
But against these circumstances, I'm always trying to improve my ideas.
From the border flamenco portrait, Flamenco-people address was selected by Alameda de Hercules with the Alameda de Hercules, which is located under the La Mata 20 number of El Photomata Galleria to October 16.
Wargas Llosa says the branch on which he works, "Prepared weather"
The location and action is still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is described by the new ruler of all these. The architecture of the Roger Casemant, who also lived 20 years in Congo and Amazonia.
In the officer Nobel's writer last night, the Festival of Hay Festival Segovia concluded that his current work was "hearted weather" and "all signs show that you should not write" the branch.
"If I would be smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm gonna do it and hope, and I'll make it successfully to the end." - with these words, he closed the presentation of the mind, thinking, and opinion, which accepted four days in the city of Aqueduc, writers, historians and journalists, and thousands of visitors.
"The city and the dogs" was one of the most important participants of the office's feast, and he also changed the hopes to be burned.
Vargas Llosa opened the price of the participants with Hay Festival, Dickens' "Working Friends" officer. He completed the John Bravo map.
Felix Romeo accepted a public community after his thanks. The public was immediately at least the time in which the writer wrote with an immune memorable capacity and a large dose was reported on how he had been reading from the special case of reading and the writer of the living life; how he believed through the writers of the officers, with the manufacturer documentation, promoting and rewriters; as a result of faith for Factor, Victor, Alex, and Duman, and how to history the year of his life.
The Latin American writer recognised that it was impossible to imagine or demonstrate whether the books change our life, but he added: "I don't think that the office has a desolation or a desolation experience," because it has an impact on people and thinking them, so he asked the writers, not to allow the ability to achieve and be responsible for their faith.
The Poblanco bubble is faster because of the current period, the horse bicavidals remain
The passengers of Pooblanco's clusters were removed last night from the machine, after the driving horse torkers were found inappropriately on the street.
The Commission Fermín Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to be consistent with the bicavian.
The periodic memberships were based on the celebration, since two of the three regulations could not be maintained.
The second bicavium was stayed on Saturday.
The leaders who descend, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco had been fighting.
That's why they've just got a bitch.
The guaranteed Daniel Luque became a trip, three ears brought to home as a throphe, and after the expensive and ecstatic battle, they were brought to the road.
At the evening, Alejandro Talavante made a lot of ear as a lot of recognition and throphea, but it could be more thanks to the community than to be respected.
But after these, El Juli followed him, who was least walking to the name of Los Llanos Arena.
After the second bicycle, the largest part of the community was brought out of the sodium.

The person adopted with drug treatment and transformation of okira.
The case occurred in the Arminion Administration Area where the Alavai Forgalm Observation was carried out in the N-1 car.
When they wanted to stop the car, the leader accepted the obedience, gave an immediate gas and left the ground of the check.
Detectives were taken to the sequence, then the vehicle was stayed a few miles below the room, and their travelways were gone to a forest area.
Finally, Baszk took one of them, and after reviewing the Iveco Daily carrier, he took its carrier, 2178 kilogram shoes.
Political bodies have been carried out in order to achieve a more basic test and reduce drugs.
Furthermore, during the check was stated that the vehicle’s false output table is not matched with the data employed in their carriers, therefore, the procedure is also initiated by the intermediate transfusion against the arrested.
The Baszk Regional Police continues to investigate the investigation, which is, at least, the other arrested arrest, which has already mentioned, has gone out of the car, otherwise the results of the invested drugs.
28 years old, A. A. A. J. was carried out to the police and began the court measures in some hours.
Heather Locklear was arrested because he led under drug effect
Heather Locklear, a popular Amanda of Melrose Place in the weekend, arrested the police in Santa Barbara (California) because he led under the effect of the medicine.
According to one observer, he tried to leave the parking in Montecito - published the people’s magazine of the California’s community overseer.
According to the vision, Locklear was about 16 hours around 30, "through the gas pressed the gas, throwing the engine, and back and backward, he tried to leave the parking, and back over more times in the ground."
It's not too late after the eyes that first probably didn't recognize the painter, he saw Locklear standing in a near car and getting out of the car.
He also announced the police because he's "for Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the officer was sitting in his car, who dealt with the automobile.
"It seems to be exhausted", therefore, the vehicles brought to drug and alcohol tests to a specialized centre.
A police dictionary says that the colorist cooperator and alcohol disappeared at least at least, and he said that, based on the first income of the honors, they think Locklear had the effect of the medicine.
Lockleart was arrested and disappointed with an unidentified organisation. At 19 hours they were sent to the local prison, where they were placed at a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of an arizonaal sanatorium, where he was struggling and depression.
Llamazares talks to the IU (Merge Baloldal) and low federation to act in Silva's case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Chief of the IU and the United Baloldal representative today stated that its regional federation would be decided to take the Sevila Government in the field of Efjúság and Sports, Francisco Manuel Silva.
"In these cases, I am a federalist, and this is actually the effect of the shipment organization," Llamazares showed the procedure that the party should be applied to the member of the citizen citizen counsel.
On the other hand, the President of the U.S.R. voted that, during the end of the rules of Silva, the "visibility" should be maintained before: "IU has always fallen into the way that such cases may be maximally transmitted."
He added that the part of the educations "in the case of the exchanged ethical codes."
"Blue's blood", Garci episode
Benito Pérez Gallons National Episodes had an action on Joseph Luis Garcit, who introduces the new français extent of the Spanish blood in May, which is the most largest contribution of his filmography with about 15 million euro budgets.
According to this, the lawyer tested in the knowledge of the writer's art always to illustrate a wonderful human price and social advice. All this is today in the film showing Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarria's company, Garci said to the people's audience from the colors.
The more than two and half hours of May's blood are shown in the movie, and later the Telemadrid Ministry will be held in four hours.
Joseph Luis Garci, the great wonderful office of the Galdox office, has made the dream of the child with this training. Everything can thank the Esperanza Aguir, it is the same that he gave three years ago from Madrid To prepare a memory film for the 2 May's madrid events. Garci, with this condition, received the event when his story is given to the National Epidecians.
In full of 15 million budgets, the Madridi Autonom Republic financed, and Garci reported a special opportunity to: "Correly decrease and signs could indicate" the Spanish locked with the evil manager, because it continued to be able to continue to fight with the country VII. Ferdinand government."
The judge concluded the property that the blood of May could not be calculated with Alatriste or Goya's fantomic budget. This was incorrect to leave some presents from the manufacturer book that - as many other times - Horacio Valcárce.
So the Restart legislation has gone to the special work system, with the colors who have already started the tests before the recurrence. Casting wasn't because Garci holds it "equal", and as he said, "the lawer master is part of the room and movement to know what happens in the industrie we work."
The blood of May, for example, Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not go first to the camera.
Garci - who is with four Oscar marks, and can be honored with a Oscar-site - thinks that before Hollywood's Academy, it is the blood of May, the seven French billars, and the finally income of the Vak Sundays, no one of the Spanish museum's younger generations, "which should be shown" - said.
Garci doesn't care about his film.
"In the beginning you think you're working for the late time and then you're going to find out that you're just lucky, and you're almost happy if you're still ready," says Garci with 30-year-year-year-old shopping after her back.
Isabel Bayon offers the Sevillan Dance Tortola Valencia life and art
A semily flamenco dance dancer sets memory to the same similar dancing.

To the end of Triennium, the "A fridge married day" is shown
A fresh married journalist will be indicator of the first isolation in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where John Ramon Jiménez married with Zenobia in May 1916. The indicator of the address of Zenobia and Juan Ramon Triennium (2006-2008) is a part of the programme of the office of the office of the Institute of the Regional Government of Andalúz.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramon Triennium are closed by the new newspapers, the International Congress in New York, the Restauration of the Nobel Daily Memory and the "Juan Ramon Jiménez: the light branch" address.

Paul Newman isn't such an American
"It's sometimes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The idea is from Sally Field's officer who worked in a film of the victims with Newman, and the increasing and inevitableness that Newman died in the American movement, and he described in all America.
But how hard Oscar's got.
Revoked in 2007,
and he was sickly sick,
But that's what he's going to do. He's killing everybody.
"It's a good friend that I've lost our own feelings in the words of unfaithfulness, and I've lost a good friend now," said Robert Redford, "he's done my best life and this country."
Nobody's afraid that it's likely to be worthy or overcome.
Mozic and home's heritage went to a particularly dark time, which caused fear of terrorism and market women, searching for American self-consciousness and sensitivity.
When so difficult times are walking and many are easy to lose their efforts and remain very few people who can look up, Louis Cernud is not necessary to be that Paul Newman's wondering.
In fact, in the eyes of people, the planet's beauty and righteousness has been carried out.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a lost and opened assets protection, beginning to create the firstborn son who died in the drug overseas.
It was a valid gift to a country that could hardly survive in the cult of self-sexual assault.
My first wonderful universe entered Hollywood without the nature of nationalities and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig says, isn't a man, but a crack died with him.
Another English, the Oscar officer Sam Mendes explained that his common work was done with Newman, clearly reported to the top point.
Russell Crowe, the worst guy from Australia, called Newman's most largest.
George Clooney, who may be one of the little ones who are trying to follow Paul Newman's life mode today: they will disturb the integrity and the challenges and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's possible in the middle of the Mediterranean Sun today.
He's still who trys, and Paul Newman is his example.
One time he was changed, but after him, he lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward, and it would have been a number of ways to the unfaithfulness.
"Why are some homburgers else, if waiting for the hot meat home?"
The heavens can be praised that the daughters of the earth are in one of them, which are not too often in America.
"It was not so honourable than the faithful husband, the loved father, the damn grandfather, and the man who gave it."
Madrid olimpy round path
We actually dream a madrid olimpy, and after 2012, it may be 2016.
But, do I ask if we really are ready for it?
Because if we're going out of the shooter yesterday, I think it's not.
They were called a perfect convention, but my view was the worst one of the many I had ever been.
He has noticed increasingly, and if he should be evaluated once, and I would be the spectacular, of course, the result would be clearly amazing.
No, but let's go on the line and start at the beginning.
Incomprehensibilities started with the exhibition of my line number, and the same exhibition had to come before.
It's not a problem in himself, but if a man goes quickly, it takes at least all once (including the chip, it will be able to stay in the later line).
Well, that's not happening.
Firstly, only the row number was given (the first unbelievable, just so faster to get) and (after staying in the row), how surprised it was, only the S pool (a second sense, because the point XL is my size) for me!
What do we live in the world?
Or have they decided to be cutting with the material and just getting smaller, smaller pools?
But, these things will still be disappointed to happen on the day of fuotvereny.
As soon as the smoking had to go to the chip before, the stay in the row was holding 15 minutes from the front, and even the backs were also to be given.
The expectation has continued 35 minutes, which is impossible for a number of 11,000 people.
So, as it was possible, the convention started, and we didn't give the backs, and when it was done, it was worse.
Furthermore, the rain has made more precious expectations than 40 minutes, which have been examined by people's advantage and stage.
I think we're going to get 500 insurance, and some of us, including us, not with our real time. I'm supposed that the chipem's mistakes.
If they ask me about the perfect fuotvernation, it would certainly not be dangerous in my case.
So I think we can keep the dream on a well prepared town of Olimpia.
Search for Microsoft (virtual) recipients
In the Conference of the MIT Development Technology, Microsoft showed a new ideal and human interaction system, a single - not too intelligent - mastering intelligence, however, to fulfil some basic tasks. For example, Microsoft can taxit (or a vehicle in the field of the company) to call out of the talk.
This "reception" is a camera and a form and visual system helps to know how much they have in the room that they - alone, it also notes how they take your clothes - and then hear and understand their keys of talk.
Furthermore, the discussions can be grouped by the presents.
The video of the receptor is identifying a third person, but he knows that it doesn't belong to the speaker society and does not apply the company.
He asks if he comes to a visitor and ensures that he's soon helping him.
It's all without the blue screen.
It's fantastic.
But, of course, this is the future music.
Currently, it is more important to the company, for example to develop the new version of the Windows operating system.
In many weeks, the Microsoft strategy has changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contains a smaller running program.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were running only the needed programs, the machines would be five times faster, Steve, that's something.
They found the Spanish widest, in fact that Microsoft has linked more functions and extres to Windows in all new versions.
The amendment is turned back.
The Microsoft's right, the operating system's runs into the Background, and you're the software.
When Google Chrome was shown on the network, I also linked to the mind, so that Google made the first step to be the Windows competition.
Many have well known that a browser is not part of the operational system.
The operation system will always be needed, because the hardver and the software dialogue is unable.
It's the same role as your wife or your husband when you want to tell her something to her mother.
That's it.
You will never lose it, but you need to calculate the operational system "Dead", not absolutely, but in relationship with it.
Ballmer's reporting this week is supporting this thought.
People have a smaller attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
We can only connect the computer to open the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and even more time for the navigation than what we load in the world of windows.
What is the largest part of applications with the system?
It's less often more.
And Windows 7 is less, it's better to be the Vitany.
Nearly hard, less low, less beaten.
The Microsoft target is to integrate your services online and to finally report alternative to Google.
They're very needed, I'm already telling a example for why.
I made this photo in a company designed in Redmond for a part of Microsoft programmes at the beginning of the month.
It's a plaquet automatically calling them up, using the company's manager.
In 2006, an independent studio was determined that Microsoft workers 66% used Google to interview.
Otherwise, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced last week.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, even in 2010.
The Microsoft probably will try with Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 markets.
The mobile phone is completed as a computer more inadequate.
But the fucking, in view of Android and the iPhone are already on the market, he will cut off their business.
The Fabulous Marcel
This took Paul Picasso at Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Veres, and Al Pacino, and Francis Ford Coppola, and also one of the bases of the gas vessels.
And if we're already holding up the specialities, or we can replace the picture of the peaceful picture of the race of the cyrical cakes of the weakness.
But what are we talking about?
So it's about "tank" as the English chickens, but the fabuleux Marcel de Brussels is not possible to be confronted.
Firstly, because of an elegant name - although friends are mentioned just as "Marcel" - which you can thank the sport, the legend says that the same name was Marcel Cerdan's boxer, Edith Piaf's lover.
Marcel's exclusive packaging material, unisex shopping, self-buffers and small (increasingly known) concurrents are also exposed. This will be hidden in the box.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports, back boxers, chambers, gascardians, sports, sports, bathrooms, ministry - and we can still be able to spend - all of them in the middle of the company products.
And all of them are holding in the category of the aim of the underwater,
Although it's uncomfortable that it's got to take them as a underwater.
That's too good.
"I'd like to be a young mother. Everyone who will be the father."
He was very similar to his brother, but he was able to gain self - control.
Monica Cruz's little and nice, but it's full of energy.
Currently, Cruz's sisters want to be a serious role in the divine world.
Monica means more than some beautiful and beautiful girls give her name to something.
It was now on the promotion of the new parish room of the Mango company, and the most largest divisions sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's the price of the price of lowness and deliciousness.
Of course, what are you doing in Paris?
The Mango's new hospital collection we show that we have planned with my brother Penelope, and outside this, we will participate in the second challenge of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Valentino's respect of Valentino in Oper.
It's just a bad day, but it's very funny.
Where did you get inspiration to the new collection?
We both pray for the movie of 50 and 60 years, and we have overcome a lot of things from there.
And then, sometimes I'm just playing the city, and I'm looking at the women how they're closing how they change and select their clothes -- this is one of my favorite time.
You're working as a dance, a color and a divorce, you're a lot of woman, right?
I'm thinking about this, but finally these three things are involved, because they're very many of them in the common point.
I've already been interested in the clothes, I've been expecting to go to my grandmother, and my grandmother's clothes.
Well, you were the Canaan, at least with a whistle park.
Then I've always been trying to watch my clothes.
You know, we want to find our own styles for hours and trials to feel good if we look at the smoke.
And in the shooting role, you'll really identify your role when you get the sign.
You see, it's all involved, and I'm all respect for the planners and training.
You've been celebrating your 30th birthday recently.
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love the 30 years.
I think women are actually coming, they've already found enough, and they've seen a lot of mistakes in life.
The biological hour doesn't worry.
From my kids, I'm doing what I like, and that's a great inner happiness.
And you want to be mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be my mother because I've been born of this as a woman, even I want to be a young mother, I don't want to leave this.
And whatever it's about your father who's going to be.
I'd like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
We're going to eat a few words about the movie, and you've got more movies that haven't been shown.
I'm sure, and I'm waiting forward to get out of here.
I who started in the house, I'm very unfortunate and unfortunate, I want everything immediately, but, of course, I know that it's impossible.
I'm almost expecting to enter the last hour and the sepulchre of Christ.
I'm asking what you're talking to them...
If I know it's okay, you've got a couple of days the fucking Naomi Campbelle.
Well, no, so that's not true...
I wasn't as a model to the output.
I've known Naomi Campbell a long time, and I just invited an economy shower to London, which was designed for a better world, and I chose two of my own Mango Collections. The invisible clothes were sold, and the infection was recommended to Naomi NGO.
People don't know how good Naomi is.
That's so many of them, so I know, and I can make sure she's not true.
I'm always looking at the good side of the activities.
Noe's for a case, but if he wanted to stand on my head, I'll do it.
If women living in the third world, I don't know what's impossible.
Returns driving leaders will be linked to the "Alcolock"
After three rules of control, the Ministry would be committed to prepare a structure that would adjust the vehicle to the launch of the vehicle if the sugar is in the ground or does not fall into the structure.
The proposal was issued in June, and currently the United States Agency is now involved with it, which will be held a year for the test project.
Since the project's objective of return to the market, the car should also take a copy of a recurrence of transport.
In the experiment, the International Security Master also participates in the Base of the Communities Directorate (DGT) and the Authentication Technology Technology (FISA).
Statistics say that 30-75% of cars arrested in the car for more times because of the driving driving.
This will apply to Alcolock because the vehicle connection system defines the inner alcohol level. If the larger level is allowed to be allowed, or if the shooter does not always fall into the preparation, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of more than 1000 euro arts would be made by the regulatory.
A study referred to in the U.S. 2007 stated that vehicles carried out with such vehicles were reduced by 65% in the first year after the exploitation.
And in Spain, according to the taxes, this rule could be saved by 115 persons in the year.
The measure also focuses on rules: it is so easier to achieve criminality,
In addition, it is easier to ensure that the implementation of the legal reform is in the shooting medium until the necessary criminal reform should be required.
The manufacturer is not yet available in any trade form on the Spanish market, although some industrial and service vehicles have already been carried out in the test mode.
The Officer votes tomorrow the Spanish Socialist Working Party on the beginning of the French example - the system of schools.
In Mexico, locked in the box
In English, at the time published in the program, 17 hours of 40 minutes landed the President of the Airport of Asturiasi Hercegi Part of Mexico in Hungary.
The sun was already in the air, but it was so much fired that we could see the king part of the air from the air.
On the board, Spanish's head and other branch persons stayed.
A couple hours ago, I asked a taxi officer on the street, knowing whether the Spanish Hercegi Part is in official visit to the city.
That's good, then there's no repeat transfer until today, the woman's ideal or something like...
No, sir, the lady is Spanish, just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the mexicano shooter, then he knows everything about the importance of the Asturian Hercegi Party and their visit.
Many are waiting for the repertoire sounds on the red steel of the 27 season, which sees the protection of the values.
It looks like Herceg, mosaic, sea clothes, and the Hercegn is also in the long ship of the wind, replaced in clothing, but not the smoke, the legs in the pitch - may have been noticed that the Mexican flows.
They're standing and moving the cameras and then entering the creation where the official approval is followed.
In the gate, one of the four largest hotels in the city - one of the mexican television television reporters wait for them.
The most valuable distribution
For a debating, the world is the most competitive location of Paris, and from today's living distributors are the most important and most doubtful Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second consultation of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, which purposes to recognize the international reconnaissance of our young skills.
The capital is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the first advice of the parisian boulevard Haussmann 54 saw his own planning clothes, and it was easy for the ability.
In addition, this company has opened the second largest European business and recently opened in 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is found in London.
We finally found in a Luxembourg Works in the Paris Garnier Oper, the event of Valentino.
In the most important Chagalos society, the President's board made by Mango's board was still most visible.
Nati, who came with a hard heart and suffering of heart, took one of the goods and some of the ELAH. He tried to be carried out with two metres of high named Luis' son Valentino to the primary office of the Holy Holiday.
Andik, the Mango's owner and home officer was cutting the guests. Rotchil's bars were so horseful to stay without clothing, because both of them were given a gift.
Monica Cruz was in his own planning board and inside the business, and with the dinner he had a sexy long black clothes. The night operating operation was in the Gaya Toledo company in the ballet creation that the old times were increasing to one of the roads and a large steel-famility.
Inés Sastre didn't participate in the pilot, but before she showed a few photos on his son.
On the next day, we could be happy in Oliver Martinez, and he's going with two metres high and motor - and John Travolta came to the hotel with Paris Intercontinent. He also brought his own rooms and distractions with her, and he said that he didn't ask any food in the room.
Stars Paris is under the edge of stars.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, striggling number
It's not 1000, but there's a way to disable the caotic and crazy weeks.
Another good news we can find all in one book that comes on September 30, to bring my rest with you.
It's a lot of smoking tomorrow at 7:00, but it's worse to think about how fast the day is going to make it a day than the day of the world today.
The office's name's failure, and his computer's back fire.
The stress is the XXI centuries.
But no one and no two ways have the day's exploitation and the employment problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
On good positions, classic massage or "spa" hands over Susannah Marriott's large room of opportunities in the book to find everybody to the most favorite and free minutes.
The stresshot work is the address of 1001 relaxation method and the price of the rest of Pearson Alhambra and DK reviews in the bookmarks.
If you are sure that the workshop or personal relationships of the world may be exhausted from the stress, this manual will make sure that it will be confident in the faith.
It also serves with other ideas that help all the explanation, for example, how we draw closer to nature or how we prepare natural food to 100%.
If you have been too low to update the body of your adrenal level and change the central problem of your stress life, here is the time to turn back in the photo, smoking and concentrate on reading.
They speak in dreams
Some kids talk night.
I don't think of those who are upset and fully dealing about what happened to them on the day, but about those who talk to sleep.
Maybe the present may appear to be an excited, but actually, it is absolutely incredible.
This is the name of soniloquism, a good dream.
Perhaps frequency, especially in the area of children and adults.
I'm sure more of them said he was talking about night.
The speed may be completely rapsodikus (e.g. only one time in a higher disease), or more regular (day, week or day), and often the child does not remember anything.
The show can't be able to return to a single expenditure.
Shortly with other bedwaters, for example, with smooths, nightly exploitation, bedwater (enuresis night) or sleeping, but it is not lawful.
As we have already mentioned, a state of high steel, or a stressheet or an isolated stage.
They've been studying a little while.
The intensity of the word is also very changed.
It may be a dead, a silence, a state of uncompatible words, a mormogation, but in contrast to all of them, it may also prevent to be mentioned in the form of exclamation, writer or longer word.
If the present is very intensive, recommended to watch the children and the experts. The test can be recorded, there is no big problem in the background, and it can also cause a solution.
As we have already mentioned, it is a good present, there is no medicine if it doesn't go together with any other, manufactable form (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, we can still do some things, here is a few times before:
Let's listen to be quiet before the child's laughing.
Let's choose quiet games, and let's see the child's fearing or aggressive television series or serious.
We are learning some relaxing methods to find the internal relationship easily.
This adds the kids to the quietest sleep.
If you still start to talk while you sleep, we'll try to keep the rest.
We don't forget that child's unbelievable, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't wake up the kid.
It'd be great because the kid doesn't know, but he'd leave the sleep.
Instead of speaking, he's actually sleeping and resting.
Don't forget that if you try more than a strong suffering, turn to an advice, or get up, what you change from the child’s big suffering.
If you are understanding of speaking (the most critical case), don't ask you to know anything about it.
It would be so worthy, because in the dreams, it would not be so wise to make his thoughts.
On the other hand, you only listen to your word, but you don't see the dreams of the dreams, so you will be careful with the understanding of the hearing and the opportunity of the conclusions.
They're never telling the kid that they can ask the secret night.
Not even a bitch.
This has changed a lot of suffering.
So it's the most important to don't worry, because it's just a few minutes of an unreasonable episode.
Finally, the Illaeusern
After a long depth, the Illlaeuser team took a new challenge, and he regained the guest in his household.
Although it wasn't a smoke, the smoke-wheel was set in more of the situation that they could finally use one of them.
It wasn't too white because the taxers felt hard to feel the appropriate ritmus.
The first chair of the campaign, Captain Kauffmann tested, but the remote labda was just at the top of the gate. Then the Illlaeusern went into the light, and they followed the leafs: Fonderflick tried to flee with a remote flight, then Hirn flowed up to the door. Romein spiccle, and Diebold also wanted to be a remote trial to go to Danama.
At the oversight, the players were able to protect in a block in the middle room, and only the Riahi airport.
It was promised to be important to the second beginning of the beginning: Riahi and Tempral was first in the situation on the side of Danemarie. After then he was born from the first egg: Diebold's first floor, he was raised with an outstanding position to Marais, and then he came to the door (53 minutes).
However, the driving of Illausern could not be satisfied for a long time: twelve minutes later, it was unreasonable to leave his boat, so that his teams had to continue to fight.
However, Danemarie was not able to use the preliminary: they didn't have a lot of problems to the home team who were just a little back to ensure their protection. Only the last seconds had some excuses when the labda came very close to the door.
Sarkozy meet the painful fish
Before you flight into the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a stranger to Bretagne.
Wednesday, the demostration held more breton and norman excuses, therefore the President of the community decided to be visited in the expenditure of Le Guilvinec in Finistère to meet the representatives.
The latter promises that the President accepts "constructive spirit" and expressed their absolute hope, as Sarkozy "comes with specific proposals."
The president's visit is along with the "Community Authority" meeting that Breton had brought fishing for the purpose of starting the gain of the gas price, since the oil had performed the average of EUR 1,14 literally.
According to the Chairman of the Communities, David Martinon, "the President will discuss the fishermen with which solutions can be helped to reduce the competitive capacity of your enterprises, or to make more safe for the mariners the conditions of work and debt."
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy.
Tomorrow, Morbihan and Calvados have held demostrations with a long-term tower with about 10 km.
They rejoiced the traveling of Quiberon's officer, but the paths leading to the Belle Island were not closed.
Quiberon's half-shirts were located.
Wednesday, the mariners have already made a witness of their difference. Then, afterwards, they collected gomybrokens and funds before the broadcasts of the broadcasts, while they were in the Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
These further movements followed the Atlantic Party and La Manche in other passengers. For example, the vessels were not going to the ship, as well as 20 ships in Le Havre.
La Turballe and Le Croisic fishermen, found in Loire-Atlantic, have been disappeared by the powerful total oil-finance block in Donges.
Boulogne-sur-Mer fishes, however, have decided that the further steps are expected to be seated in the Ministry.
In Le Guilvinec, the same "Community Authority" should be decided on the next step and participation of the meeting planned in the Parise Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry.
However, some breton fishing does not want to be a representative of the national fishing committee, since the Commission has not supported its costs.
"The fish continues to continue," because "the fishermen don't allow their requirements" and "no fishermen go to Paris" reported Liliane Cariou, the President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The fishing fishing that don't pay pay after the gas is currently paying 50 cents for a letter, however, they think that a ship operation is only in the future, if the gas price is literally reduced under 0,30 euros.
The wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and Sundance kids" are forgotten in the home connecticuti, 83 years ago in the end of the death, a rare assault.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes were also cutting respects in the 83-year-old movement and exhibition of Paul Newman.

AIG equipment should assess more than 15%
The United States Financial Authorities would like to assess more than 15% of their instruments to pay back 85 billion dollars for the part of the American International Group - reported by the Financial Times Domain.
Furthermore, the international level of life security and the American insurance activities, the AIG of all other businesses, noticed the news that brought nearby resources to the Agency.
According to the Times notices, the AIG Administrative Board was held on Sunday, in order to examine the opportunities of assessment.
The AIG has not strengthened this information.
The AIG wishes to assess the company includes the airport license of the International Lease Financial Corp., the Transatlantic Holdings insurance company, the 59% party of the 59% party in the office of the transatlantic Holdings, and the investment portfolio and the self-official equipment - makes it to the Times.
The magazine says, however, the final decision is not yet related to the assessment.
The AIG should quickly go to the equipment to pay back to 85 billion dollars approved by the American government. This takes the risk to change from 80% of the head of its head, and also ensures its shares in that respect.
The Paris History study on the Morning Meeting's history of Morning Meeting
The story of New York was reported in a week after the senator rejected Paulson banking plan. The Dow Jones index was returned to 6,98% (which has never seen, nearly 800 point reduction) and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) 777,68 points, so 10 365,45 points closed.

The representatives rejected the resources requested by the Financial Ministry Henry Paulson with a vote "no" against 205 " yeah" with 228 "no".
The plan has been nearly two thirds of the Republicans.
"But the market has blown bad signs because it seems that the Congress has not been able to accept a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial element.
"It seems how much the market has been raised to this plan, and then he expressed a relative concern that if you were adopted a plan later for some days, it would be "for too late."
"If the plan is actually condemned to death (...), then the Fed (American Central Bank) and the other central bank will be on the line to handle the crisis, and the conditions of faith will continue to digging," noted Brian Bethune, leader of the Global Insight.
Piegza adds: "Every more and more financial institutions are in the United States."
After the Washington Mutual Pennsylvania, the authorities were sure that Wachovia's bank businesses were raised by Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has not been quickly quick, which has been required to save banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market "not only American, but the world-wide crisis" is the element of the FTN Financial element.
The connection market has been significantly exceeded.
The 10-year-year-year-old state currency was reduced to 3,827% from 3,632%, and the 30-year-old time returned from 4,357% from 4,161%.
Obama opened the first television park
The two President of the United States, the first seat of a new follower, which had to be considered that John McCain or Barack Obama would go out of the campaign.
In an extraordinary way, the Republican and the Democratic campaign responsibilities said to themselves the winning in the television campaign, which has been observed by the United States households a third time.
David Gergen's political representative said, although John McCain was worthy of respect, even though it was not sufficient to "increasing" to stop the reduction of the population: it proves me to be prepared for five weeks before the President's election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic Democracy is better in the fight: According to the results published in the sambaton, Obama is five-minutely prevented with McCain (44% and 49%).
The most important computer, even undefined electorers, says, 39% of the issued Obama will be raised until 25% of their McCain's gains, according to the CBS.
Obama is expected to increase the prevention of his party, Joseph Biden, with a great promising counsel. He is prepared for the first and the only public victory, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned on the weekend, "I would be able to lie down to Palin.
They've got good advantages."
In the seventh years, McCain will never disappear its own, invisible foreign policy experiences, which will always be able to vote to "navigation" in these questions in the center of their first personal meeting.
"It seems, the Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." He sounded a lot of time.
"I don't think Obama's Senator's headquarter with the needed experience and science to the president position," said McCain.
This is the main area of attack that is used by the tv republicans from last night.
Obama, however, set up the sound that he's representating the future.
He didn't allow you to take up to the worm: he was totally accepted and exactly recognised.
He said that he could make good decisions and restore the picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama has already been," he turned back to the democratic democratic announcement in the weekend, which takes it on the eye of the Republican leader, that he has not yet measured the impact of the crisis on the American "Uca people".
John McCain was a lot of speaker about me in the lives nine minutes, but nothing about you said yesterday before Obama's 20,000 people who were gathered together to the electoral meetings in the north Caroline.
It's not only the word "middle" or "employees" in the mouth. It's increasingly liked to Obama, whose Americans keeps the most worthy to save the economy in the financial world.
"The future week's turning point might be proved" was Charles Schumer, the influenced democratic senator last night.
Rahm Emanuel Democratic representative, one of the Clinton government, says that Obama is "in the economy area as Bill Clinton's financial crisis in 1998.
In view of the Democratic Presidency, the current crisis is "the fulfillment of the evil economic policy for eight years, which created George Bush with the support of McCain Senator."
The unnois senator reaffirmed that the 95 per cent of Americans could be reduced against the inhabitants of the officers, and that the 95 per cent of the Americans would be able to reduce the sustainable energy dependence of the country through the use of the renewable energy resources and the development of health security systems.
However, McCain plans 45 atomic exploitation to 2030.
However, both presidents were attentively examinated the issues of a total banking plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), and the congress has adopted the regularly popular plan yesterday.
"The President's noticed that the election has been done here?"
Children and adversaries have been disappointed on Monday at the white headquarters to refuse the expected results of Parliament's elections.
On the evening, after the closed voting rooms, more than hundreds of whites gathered together on the head of Minsk in order to advertise the election results.
Although you haven't yet published the results, many young men intended Alexandra Lukasenko against the President, saying, "Mr. Diktator, say it!"
Some are surprised that they didn't just go to vote, "Why would I have gone? So they do it with my voice that they want!", says a young man.
They don't believe that the census that has been trying to achieve themselves in a good color before the foreign superintenders would be prepared for a democratic change.
If I had judged the officers to purify the elections, they could resolve the country's ranges, which were able to be taken from 40 white leaders of the water, and some bank numbers.
However, the elections were not pure.
"We have taken away from the election committees, and our officers could not participate in the vote number" (Juri Potyemkin), organized from the twelve Party, so it is very theerogeneous of the United Democratic Forces Coalition.
"The changes were just named" - says Aleksandr Milinkievics, President's election and leader of pro-European movement. "The fact is to calculate the votes, and in our case it is the implementing power.
If the contrary senters enter into the Parliament, it means that they were called, but they were not selected.
But their income to the Parliament allows them to take place in the television, to sit in the regions and legislation.
Therefore, the contrary must be drawn into a color in the political life, because "the dialogue must be started with the European Union."
Likewise, if our seriously sold economy is a crisis and we are not able to renew, we risk that Russia will be under the power of power.
But we want to be dependent."
The controversy describes that the European Security and Co-Communication Organization, in view of the election process, shall apply the result of voting.
Sounds to sound that the participant assessment seems to be too high and that the previous vote has given any opportunity to manipulate the electoral citizens in Minsk (as well as 26% of the electoral population).
"Have the President noted that the election has been done here?", says the question of Alexander Kozulin social democratic leader, who was allowed to be free from the prison where they were held as a political prisoner.
There's no one in the voting fields.
And to the Parliament, on the above five contrast representatives, even those who are responsible for the leadership.
In October, the night's smoking on the ground again.
And in the television, the President Lukasenko and the Central Selection Committee are joyful.
The blood is safe
The eleventh anniversary of the Hema-Quebec celebration last night. Dr. Francine Decary was a good reason to celebrate, because Hema-Quebec has already changed one of the most safe and efficient blood society of the world.
It is the most important: people's confidence had been able to return to the effects of blood in 1980 and 1990.
As well as known, the national blood conservation processed by the Canadian Red Creek Service was infected by the 1980-year-old Immunian Federation (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus.
After the drama and the general reception, the Canadian Government has initiated a official test of the Court of Horace Krever in February 1994, and it was the purpose that it was to decline the light of the circumstances to the tragedy and to adopt proposals for the future similar events.
While the report of the Court Crever was subsequent, some regions have brought its own Committee to establish a new blood management system for Canada.
The Gélineau committee fulfilled this task in the past.
Following Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services came to create in Canada: one of the Chebec server Hema-Quebec, and the other responsible for all other regions and two territorys.
"When Hema-Quebec started in 1998, the people had almost 38% of confidence in the Quebec blood system" remembers Dr. Decary.
The situation was a whistling.
"In the next years, however, the improvement of the safety of blood manufacturers and the results of our work in the area, we have reached people's confidence." Decary states that at the beginning of 2008, the 94% of the Quebec residence has already been able to trust Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary doesn't remember that "the confidence is extremely incredible."
Since Hema-Quebec, 28 September 1998, it applies to the warning.
In this period, there were numerous cases in Europe when the carrier married, also the creutzfeldt-Jakob sickness, reported to the doctor who directed the society since the foundation of 1998.
"We weren't surprised if this disease was blown in the blood.
That is why we agreed to one of the most important recommendations of Krever and Gélinoeau. However, if we are unbelievable and the risk of severe diseases, we must apply exclusive measures. In this case, it was about Creutzfeldt-Jakob sickness that causes the change of the mind, so it leads to unresolved death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who had been carried out more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And in some years, all the doubts were clearly determined that the blood of the disease was also in the way of disease.
This case has confirmed us that we had a sense to apply the career."
In 1999, a technology that allows more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This is the nucleinsavtest (NAT), which can directly demonstrate the virus, and not the anticorps against the virus, which has been used in the first place.
With the NAT test, we could reduce the window period that has been able to reduce until we can help the virus technical tools to show in the blood - explains the sackman.
This period could be reduced for a shorter time for a week.
Thus, it was significantly increasing the risk of the bloody victims to be polluted outside the blood system and to not show it.
With these developments, the risk of reduction of the AIDS blood disappearance was greatly reduced.
In our days, the risk of someone who has a blood infected with HIV virus, 12 million to one.
"In addition, this means that we should spread 12 million blood preparations until someone is infected with HIV virus.
Since the Hema-Quabec is divided by 400-5000,000 blood preparations every year, more than 24 years should be fulfilled to enable such cases, and a person will be interrupted with HIV-virus in a blood preparation.
I think anybody's already accepted, or can write blood-transfusion for the reinforcement of health - sets the first number of Hema-Quebec.
"The next year's call is to maintain the confidence of our products.
We can't know how new cracks get into the system.
It was only in the past year that Reunion was shown by the chikungunya virus, which came in like the West-Nilus virus.
That's why we need to be permanently weird" - Dr. Decary continued, and then he said that it should be concerned with the suffering of the permanent content of Hema-Quebec.
"There are grown up with the old manner of the people.
Since racial treatment has become more aggressive, patients have often needed red browsing or blood disks.
The age of the population is also influenced on the states of blood, since the number of people in the network is only 3 per cent of the chequebetic residence.
However, every healthy, at least 18 years, can give blood every 56 days in the year with six times.
The reporters have not received blood in a transparency from 14% because they were corrupted with AIDS or Malaria, and those who walked in a country where malaria destroys were not allowed to be blooded for a year.
"It's three percent of this, we have a lot of contents that we can suffer the needs of the hospital.
It's very weird to get out of the things.
However, we need to increase the number of blood victims as your old ones, because they can't give blood any more after a time.
However, people are very difficult to make blood, but it is difficult to keep them and cut them into a regular blood.
In this crazy world, the only hours of the man is at least to give blood." - Francine Decary is sorry.
Hema-Quebec, which is achieved by 297 million years of age budget, does not just ensure blood preparations, but also human texts, for example cross-transplantations, heart-class, personal texts and smokes, which are at least used as simplely severe persons.
These texts are raised, transformed and cutting, and they are located on the Emma-Quebec, which also handles the only public boxes of Quebec.
The blood of the kids in the hair can be exposed to the treatment of severe diseases (e.g. leukemia).
"We celebrated a few weeks that we got in our banks like a thousand kids of kids, and we planned more than thousands of new examples in the year.
In the beginning of the future year, we may have already started for these recommended organizations," Dr. Decary, who believes that the manufacturer of childhood is very popular.
"I'm my mother's sorrowful thing that there's no possibility for this," it's actually because Hema-Quebec has not been available in all hospitals in Quebec to do this complex and cost program.
Labdaging - Impact preliminary
The Montreal Impact team was raised at 3:1 at Seattle Sounderst on the USL-1 officer, and the total results of 4:3 were entered into the preventive. This was the second-quarters and the contingents that were in the Saturday Station.
Antonio Ribeiro, the decision-wide, has made an average rate in 90 minutes.
While the first fearful egg was gone, the second shower team was found in the network of David Testo and Rocco Plancentino.
Only from the Sounders Team, Roger Levesque was able to play Matt Jordan's caps.
Remember that on the first dimension of the penetration, the Impact 2:1 was suffered by Starfire Complex in Tukwil, Seattle.
The Impact is playing with Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder Team, who took the first chair from Whitecaps at 3:1, was guaranteed to 4:3, however, Whitecaps entered the total results of 5:4.
The Impact's pre-previewed weekly and afternoon met Whitecapss, but the details of the dimensions are still exactly today.
In the diothee - Kovalev winds
Canadian's favorite triases are ready to wait for the new horse.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitzin led three great attacks, and finally the Canadian ship against Florida Panthers was 3 and 2 in the front of the prisons last night in the Centre Bell.
Costitzin, the first number of meetings made a round, and Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the measurement of the team's six preparations of my fourth winter.
The measurement Kovalev decided that he made the only hair of the hair.
"I'm not ready." The Russian player warnings.
"I need another bitch to feel in a form of me."
"He tried to get too much out of you in the first third," says Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think it's so happy for the fulfillment of the crazy.
He's got a lot of eggs."
Charest Northern Research
The Government does not conclude that the election is still started
At the end of the collection of the Liberal Part, Jean Charest has already been traveling to Jean-Talon, where the New Health Ministry, Yves Bolduc (ballood) has been able to gain my gain.
"Recover our last large north border," this ambitional long-term target Jean Charest approved to the assembly of Quebec Liberal Part Levis. The word also increased with visa elements, but the President tried to focus on the fact.
While prevention, after the back, the pictures like "Moulin a images".
Three hours in the exposure were followed by one another: water car rentals, training operations, Quebec in "Google Maps", maps...
Such visibility tools have been able to enter in election periods.
In other words, the Government was not able to guarantee that the election would not begin in the time, although he added that the period is very wide.
The "extreme plan" is the fourth point on the future of the Government Chebec, which is in a "new economic area", which is a working agreement related to France, a agreement between Canada and Europe and more, and an agreement planned with Ontarium.
At the last time, the opening of the North (the north area beginning at the 49th length) was often made in the government's words, but it has never been maintained in this subject.
However, the State Chief just explained why northern holds the "country of these opportunities" and he didn't talk about the period, the investment costs, or a particularly important arrangement of the future projects.
In addition, several development opportunities have been issued: in particular water vehicles, forest energy, and in particular the railway, which further increases the growth of countries in the market and the rebuilding of State infrastructures.
In the northern, it is found "while, figs, wedding, platine, gold, silver, wedding, titan and yet gleaming" - said Charest.
This is the area that "double times as France", "the part of our area, Quebec.
Not only for us, but it can be found in us." He repeated the State Chief, sounding that it wants a national basis.
She declared that Quebec was greatly defined in the relationship with the North: the golden room in Abitibib, the Chebec planner's work, James's...
"This is our future!" he made him after having a colored break, he remembered the original map found behind him.
In the 70% of the north of the Quebec area, Labrador also includes a part of the Labrador, which was always requested to him, the Governor communicated by the officer.
"This is our historical staff that confirmed all governments.
It's a limited limit that has no longer time in relation to him, and if it is given to it, I will reaffirm the same employment in the government's name."
On the other hand, "We have to think about our looking points related to the North in the climate change" - explained the Government about the north-west procedure, which will be opened every year after reading of the sky.
According to the Government's opinion, this new geopolitic environment is an important task to take the area.
And what's going to do with the fields, the Indians, and the chickens?
The Government explained that the Government of Quebec has made their attention to them, and they will have many benefits from the plan, especially for young people.
Two Ministers for various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Letourneau (against the party Quebecois) have already been started with a three-year-old community.
The Ministerial Committee of Benoit Pelletier has started an important role in which Julie Boulet (minister responsible for the resources and natural resources).
The Government doesn't shut out a big-free meeting, "not consistently" opportunity where "increasing water".
For the development of the northern, it would be in accordance with its sustainable development.
The North Plan is connected, occupied and will be a environmental bar." He promised the Government.
Jean Charest wrote this "water" as a agreement with the opinions of his Liberal Ministers.
"Only as the previous liberals, we also think, we're going to create new growth and development opportunities from the calls."
This was the one of the returned theme of the weekend, which began to celebrate the fifty-year-year-old party of the election of Jean Lesage party.
One of the adopted decisions recommends that the Beauharnois forces have been made by Adelard-Godbou.
"We parked the policies, among others, Godbout, based on Hydro-Quebec, the great resource and the national development of the water cars, or as James's father, was known as Bourassa, everybody knew how to achieve the future." Jean Charest said.
The report has also shown another - true, concertive - work, even between John Diefenbaker, 1957 and 1963, the Ministry of Roads to the North.
In relation to the Eastmain1a-Ruper aircraft plan, the President Charest concluded that it was planning for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I'm planning to be there," he sold our calls, and he accepted his calls.
The Minister, who still said that there will be no choice in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not closed his opportunity for a vote that has been able to vote to the law on a day.
However, he sounded that the sun was now full, because she had taken on the Chinese counsel and the Quebec-New York's meeting.
In the end of the weeks, the collection of the liberal President has proved to explain national decisions, which have been accepted without a lot of thinking, especially on the "compatible rate" of the Liberal Party, especially the "Quebec's own sign" in the Office.
I also want to, if Quebec could call out the Canadian Radio and Telecommunication Council members, and these members would be held with the protector of the decisions taken in Quebec.
However, the controversy accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
Paulina Marois, leader of the Partie Quebecois, renewed the political development policy that the Landry Government led in 2001.
Marois says that the Liberal Government rejected the application of this policy in 2003.
If they wouldn't have done, "but we'd have been very preceding," Mrs. Marois made an agreement with Mrs. Françoise Mercure, who was listed to the vote of Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ Contracting Party supports the Government to accept the North Plan.
"It's what we want if this wasn't a lot of color," says the Sebastien Proulx partner who replaced Mario Dumont today from the freedom.
Living - A merciful country
Vic Toews, minister of the Harper campaign (including the "Region Office" Minister), took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada "the "the ship of the ship".
Thus, a woman who was unfortunately fighting for the truth and bringing all our wonders - it is very much to pay for the Ministry's around and Stephen Harper.
This is why our government, who has not carried out of the relevant western countries along with its own country from the Guantánama's concentration camp.
This government, who doesn't take care of the fact that Omar Khadr was still a defense in the time of committing his criminals.
This is the only government that, in contrast to that Canada signed the Genfi Agreement, has approved the vote and allows a child’s unfair circumstances.
The only Government who makes a fault of the fact that he examines a criminal crime.
Remember that the UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian Auditors also require the return of Omar Khadr to participate in an intermediate procedure in Canada.
But our government is low on the torpe: he doesn't mean that a young adult has already been destroyed now, and that many years of dreams may be able to live for a life.
Although this is not yet known, but now our rights, our freedom and our democracy are going to be destroyed under our democracy. "Democracy": Harper silently sounds this word, which sounds as an empty word from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more power: they can be able to shoot, cut down and cut down any Canadian citizens, according to the love of a governor who was a little while (and what can come after October 14...)?
Many electors believe that you can find the welcome in a park that honors the Erien, the Thunder and the Rendet. They don't see that this government's lower values that our country could thank the good news and the valuableness of our country.
Mr. Toews, it's the worst thing you're not going to look for others.
Implementation - Barrick Gold orwell vocabulary
In the number 17 September Le Dever, a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the Canadian Barrick Gold's manager of President.
Dr. Orwell's smoking, Mr Garver, states that the world's largest gold carrier company has been initiated by three authors and a small expenditure company for the beginning of a "life" of the world.
Although the judges are dependent and unpartial, their decisions, especially in the periods of gratitude, are not the truth but the law.
It's not surprised that Garver had heard deeply about this basic difference.
Does Barrick Gold really be the best way of public life to destroy anyone who is contrary to his position?
In addition to the expense of per, the books and expenditure of the Noir Canada addresses should be carried out in an inequality battle, where the customers who are on the other side with the level of non-exportable sources.
In such an unlikely battle, sometimes they use the tactics to destroy the alperest and friendly agreement, which are not only to listen to the enemies but also fear those who are trying to reavoid the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public vision, it would have been better before the community.
It may be good in many other countries where Barrick Gold continues to act, that happens in other ways, in Canada, the passengers often don't be grateful to each other, but they tell them their thoughts.
That is why his child would have enough to open his books and friends and prepare for a treatment, medium, publishers, paying the independent research groups that could be lighted on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust in the community, and with a movement, it's the requests and letters written in the protection of the authors of Noir Canada.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how to start the "clear" rate if he doesn't get anything to the opinion of this publicity?
In the head of the President, this word is likely to refer to the charges paid in the bus, but not the compatibility of Canada: the reputation report is so good.
In a democratic state, there is also other experts in the freedom of talk.
But Barrick Gold doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand - that the authors of Noir Canada and expenditure mainly supports publicity because he judges the procedure of his fault.
It was ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but it was not for many that would be more to hear. (The expression “expliction of public life” was recently published in Barrick Gold in writing by the authors of Noir Canada to maintain this expression.)
Garver's surreal shoes are intended to ensure the freedom of university research and searching for truth which makes all democratic society builders.
In all the procedure, the right to guide faithful sources, and to the rights on the facts and their understanding, which constitutes the basis of spiritual activities.
If a country similar to Canadian can only be trained and visited themes that do not like the rich companies of the world today, who will take the loyalty?
If Barrick Gold really wants a open and transparent vial, it could be done according to scientist standards that are used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have a long time to handle vitas, viewlessness and conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unexpected procedure shows good that nothing is able to continue in the contrast of the setting.
This means the loss of the world of the universities, and the Canadian public victory institutions, and this is the time to implement measures in the end of governments, which limit the legal procedures launched for such return purposes.
Wall Street shipping actions - Democratics and Republicans
The Government of Bush and the Republic of the Congress and the Democratic Leaders have been fulfilled last night on the economic relief action, which has been the greatest freest plan since the 1930s.
The 700 billion dollars plan, which has been achieved by the total financial crisis in Wall Street from months ago, must still be approved to leave the two houses of the Congress.
The essential points of the plan: more effective control by the representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the proposed State money; new provisions to maintain the number of households covered by payment; the right of assessment to pay the leaders of the company participated in the assistance.
Henry Paulson, American Financial Ministry, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Representative and Judd Gregg, party representative of the negotiations, had been reported for a few minutes before the good news after the end of the two-day maratoni negotiation.
"We've made a pre-progress to a solution that will actually work on the markets," said Henry Paulson, the representative of the Bush government.
"We made all this goal to save the reality and the American citizens from the current crime of Wall Street," explained the Democratic representative.
"The most important point is that if we don't do this, then it'll be an oryagist of the smoke, the Caos and the pigs in the American life every day," said Judd Gregg, representative of the Republican.
The negotiation has been exceeded in the last few hours, fearing that a new carrier effect would be on the sound of the investors.
To the Agreement, the guard was given to you a limit time until the morning opening.
The two presidents, which later linked to the negotiations, showed the preparatory to the agreement, however, have been expressed, do not happy that the situation has finished.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has properly promoted the extension of the Agreement with elements such as to keep your household, or to pay your managers of companies.
"When we ask the donors to make some extraordinary steps for other people's responsibility, it is not too happy.
But these steps are needed." He reported in a American TV arts.
But when John McCaint asked another cancer about it, he said, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope it's right."
"What I read in large lines, you'll see that there's something that we all have to know, and we can continue to walk.
It's the opportunity we're not doing anything, just unacceptable."
According to the 700 billion plans, the payer's money would buy the two requirements of the US funding institutions, which have been exposed to risk, unreasonable instruments.
The plan has prevented a period of 14 months, which has initiated the packaging of ingatilphy. This first leads to the combination of riskless ingathanhites (including reports), and then transmitted to other, reliable valuable papers, and finally informed the income of liquid sources and banks and financial resources.
Republican representatives of the First Agreement Agreement have shown a group in the past week.
It seems that we've been exhausted from the crash since the democratics have found that certain "merciful" companys are in the difficult situation are just as to ensure the government as if it doesn't be raised.
In order to be sufficient for all members of the Congress, there is also a provision to be made in the plan, which suggests that if the government needs to take losses for five years in the framework of the programme, you can take new data for the recovery of its resources.
As a new plan, a 250 billion billion details should be paid first; it may follow more than 100 billion billion if the President is required.
The payment of 350 billion dollars by the Congress should be approved by another vote.
For aid, Washington will participate in supported companies, which will take part of the reward, and which will be considered after the crisis.
The Covenant Government will be able to monitor the employment of non-profits in the plan, which can also increase the maximum value for the leaders of the companies concerned by the crisis.
I want the plan to work, if the plan is already the representative's house today, and the senate is organized.
However, in contrast of their strength, it does not still be sure that the plan is accepted.
The same statements have been revoked once yesterday in all the republicans and the democratics.
"Exactly clear that Washington doesn't listen to your voice," said to the electorers of the Republican Scott Garrett, who is member of the financial committee.
"Yes, we have severe financial problems.
Yes, the solutions will be resolved.
But there's no one who would like the payers."
Brad Sherman, the "Skeptic Fractions" named a small democratic representative of the Democratic Congress Group, showing things, but it's going to the same end.
"Firty hundred exclusive economic experts, among us three Nobel's scientists wrote us to ask the Congress: don't come, and you're based on to examine the way you choose." Sherman reported yesterday.
In Europe, it was the same time that it was a worldly crisis here.
After a crisis proceedings, three Benelux stated that 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars) was a part of the Fortis Bank Group.
The participation of the Governments of Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg after the required that the BNP Paribas, France, would not buy the concurrency of the stage of your steel after the consumption of 2 billion euros (2,9 billion dollars) has lost the second currency of reporting in the United States.
Fortis is one of the most largest European banks and the tenest security company with its applied for 85 thousand.
"This isn't the money" was published last night, Wooder Bos, the Netherlands Financial Ministry.
"We have voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly the thing that customers and households are considered greater now that the situation is promised uncertainly."
In the middle of La Manche, the British government seems to be prepared for a new bank that separates financial crisis.
According to the English officer, the government would enter a total of credits in the Bradford and Bringley bank process, from which the ingathanhites are 41 billion fonts (75,5 billion dollars).
The Spanish Santander bank told us yesterday that they're gonna explore his British bank's daughters and businesses.
Bradford and Bringley, after this Northern Rock, would be the second bank who wants to establish the British government since the beginning of the crime.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Busy from the color standard
The very beautiful smoking eyes, according to some of his main cards, others, were the most weakness.
Have you ever been free from the Narciss shooting of the smooth American color?
Yeah, I don't.
In addition, the comfort, sensitivity and the born capacity was remote from it the military style that exists real monsters in the artist.
But what a powerful ship was running in!
Paul Newman was 83 years old, and he died in the shoes in the branches of the bondicted birth, and he was one of the last icons of the American movie winds.
It was less monumental quality than Brando, who was compared to him, and who was considered a long-term customer in the film. It was more rapider in the series, but he also announced the freedom and the dramatic conventions.
They are often originating outside children from blood suffering.
In Newman, 1925, the German father of Jewish and Hungary mother was born in Ohio.
The European branches contributed to the born of a symbolic dream of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about you that just focused on the interests.
Because it was in it a "self-made man" story and a fighting ideal in the Chinese Ocean War. At the beginning of the 1950-year-year-old Yale university, and then he learned in the New York Actor's Studio before he was broken in the room, television, and not much later in the movie world.
While the citizen rights were a lot, the second location in Le Mans' 24 hours in 1979 was held in the campaign of Le Mans. All the time, as sexy, it might live in happy marriage since 1958 with Joanne Woodward.
Now we can't know how the secret, locked, locked, locked by his work, who hated the show-business smoking, that's already hidden forever.
He was a famous man, in the most important sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death on the end of the weeks of the Mozicipality: we can see only on the black screen of the memories.
We've seen the seventh American arts, over 50 years before the movie's continuous changes.
In our memory, the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kids" is a famous cowboya (1969) and his feeling wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who were in the role of the "Macska in the forro crazy" named Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From the last time (1990), we can remember the feeling of Mr. Bridge, who is at least concerned that his marriage has not changed his hopes.
Paul Newman could see a lot of other faces in his films.
Robert Wise is an unforgettable imagination in the Rocky Graziano's office of life's famous criminal boxer. This is the original James Dean's goal - and after his death - a series has initiated Newman's colour carrier in 1956.
Also played a sympatic crime in a brilliant name of "The Great Bath", which was opened in 1973 for the best film.
Robert Rosen, in his digital film "The Svindler" (1961), was raised a billion play, and in the similar role returned to Martin Scorse "The Financial Colour" film. For the last design he received the only Oscar's election in 1987.
Various times, but always the same face: it was him.
It was always like that.
The change of the time of the department has been reported.
The youngest is especially known by George Roy Hill's culture film (1977), where Reggie Dunlopot, a ice-carbon team is not too normal.
In 1994, the Rajongo was published by Coen Brothers.
The film of Sam Mendes was closed in 2003: it appeared to be the last part of a writer.
In contrast to many movements who were quickly left the film record, Newman remained in a long-term reflexor, may have condemned Hollywood with its connection, lighting and imagination.
Bertrand Tavernier France filmer didn't mean without any humor as "the living chauffage of the player": it says that the game was too strong.
However, it wasn't always grateful with the good man Paul Newman, who had been a long time just falling into the murder of the movies.
Young and successful characters were played in the ribbe: more than the field of the society, alcoholist, worse or hoped - figures that could be able to return with perfect trust.
Newman showed a little known face: a very sensitive and sensitive man in the deep spirit.
With his wife in the film "Rachel, Rachel" in 1968 (a adaptation of the writer of Margaret Laurence Canadian), Joanne Woodward was drawn on a melanchorical port of a melanchorical woman.
The name of "Harry and the Son" was made in 1984 with a film of receipt and suffering, and the son who died in drug overdose, sets the memory of Scott.
Yesterday, the Newman's unexpected agent remembered the colorist. His internal friend and his old fighter, Robert Redford (which was played in "the big bathroom" and "Butch Cassidy and Sundance kids"), thus explained: "He made my life and the world better.
Greatness and joy: this was the secret of this great coloring quality we've lost now.
Instead of its management carrier, the courts of the public rights, the environment, the battle continued and the Hollywood exhibitions of the non-dependent film production.
Sometimes we could see his picture in margins, shoes, shoes, shoes and other foods, and he did so bad mouths, although he was still funny at the beginning.
However, the introduction of such sales were always required for children who were infected in the disease.
Newman never sitting in her grandfathers: she was finally attached to the scramble.
In his five daughter's letter, he wrote the following words: "My fathers were always increasingly grateful for his happiness.
It was a privilege for me that I could be here."
Our number is also a privilege that we could fulfill such a great and great American artist's exploitation.
He was like a citizen, all of them.
What did the Agreement in the Chai Calculator?
On 8 October, the Agreement begins to be punished against John and his society.
Political and society, particularly important carried out in crime, continued to be employed with an employment and other crimes, with the transfusion of others.
According to the Agency, the public payment money was used for their own purposes, and the implementation of the tasks were often corrected with unrealised accounts.
In the total of the State and Government money, about 65 million in part of the Baalold Fisher, some persons were cut off in the ship.
The procedure recognized by the detective authority was that the expensive payment money had been taken on the basis of costs which were not realistic completion after, and the members have never made food for the competent obligation.
The consent says that the numbers were a lot of false.
These were raised in the jurisdiction market, and the crowds were produced by Kiskunhalson.
For the name of the companies, there are more than the balaton front, which has been sent by Lados Istvan.
According to the last statement, they had to look at pansions and equipment.
He requested its consumptions, and then prepared accounts to the Ephesians and Sport Ministry, the Social and Working Party, and the Republic of the Supreme Government.
In most of these cases, Lados Istvan was reported with the company, Dr. Andras, who, according to our information, wrote the most important reports for support.
One of the Lados' students was a shirt.
According to two numbers in 2003, the veterinary location has ensure that the Security Count of the United Nations group of seventy main groups were reached.
Yet, according to the company's manager, they wouldn't have brought them once to the rent.
The same for the right future - later, the number of forms and content mistakes was rejected in the 2002 series of the third year's name for the Treaty Year.
A pansion was just three rooms in the same chambers, and ten people couldn't sleep in it more than one night, and the number talked about hundred thirty-five vendors.
However, the fantastic printing loaders also have marked Pigal Kft., which is in the book, according to the information given to the guidance - did not include documents related to the right future and the Hoppa.
His company leader, Farkas Guideman, said to hvg.hu, when they were invited and showed accounts to him, he knew soon that it was about false documents.
"The name of our company and our gifts were made in a bad place."
She brought: the formal cases were not too stimulated that hundreds of people were held, and they have all ten rooms in which there is no such marriage.
In addition, he said to the number's schedule, while their building is not working for a long time.
The business calculators did not follow that the Budapest travel office was only organized foreign paths, so they have marked a botorous Hungarian travelling as a service on the payment number, which was not even matched with the companies' payment.
In addition, as in the investigation, the document has also been established in the document, since the training activities in the European Union were a significant way of training in outside countries.
More of the ground measures were also misled by Hotel Revfülülöp Kft. in the four documents set for the right future, not the same company service is not 25%, but the 15%-based basis, where the hotel uses only machines were made, but it was the hands of the completed number.
In this case, the "instaurants" has also been considered that the company has not continued to reach the investment advice in the case of a company.
Furthermore, the principles of the non-comprehensive accounting format, not true employee, declared that the Treaty's Standard for the Third Year, the XXI. The Szadi Culture Unit and the Certain Pont are false accounts.
In the case of Ravenna Bt or the Sport Station, the representatives had said that they would have released the accounts.
They did not observe the wrongdoers, for example, that the public HIB Kft had been submitted in that time (2001) when he was busy for the Son’s Work Group, and therefore the company was a highphone office - we know - he also said that he had put the paper out.
They were sure.
The other groups of accounts are the ones who were clear that they should fix a number.
The Budapest Based for the Isly Budapest, the Son Baloldal - Esfu Socialists, has made a number for the Treaty Year's Standard for four million.
His leader of Collab Kft - according to the conviction - one of the ransoms, Györfi Ludovic took it to pay the efficient account.
Furthermore, the Biogate Kft, which is present under the current assembly, in 2003, has seen the standard for the right future, the Atlantic Union and the Red Virtual Union, has seen a number of $5 million, which was not a real economic activity behind.
Financial movement not because the calculations were already forgotten, but these organizations have already been forgotten to collect in their documents.
The following groups of expenditure companies are linked to the currency.
Thus, the budapesti officer was a budapesti budapesti, although there was no location of the manuscript of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio Kft.
The company also made more accounts in October, November, and December 2005 for the sale of technical equipment in about 18 million.
According to the investigation data, the Cash Investment Kft was purchased from 14 September 2005.
This company was an manager of a Roman man who would also transmit Cubatov Ivan to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know that Kubatov under the investigation knew that in the name of the kft, the Atlas, the Hopp and the Count for the Third Year, and he took their contrast values.
They told Kubatov Ivan's request was based on the Room Room Cars on Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, one of the companies did not work that was the reason that they didn't get their job.
In addition to the companies, it has been useful because his employee, also preparing the papers of the construction of the Holy Zsolt Advocate, has made accounts in the names of the companys: Atlas and Y-generation.
The Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave Cubatov a total of 15 numbers to the organizations in 14,2 million.
The Agency has changed that the 10% of the counts were raised in the accounts and the board was cut down the Cubatov mark.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt for fixing accounts, these were produced for the Security Pont approval.
In January 2006, the Y-generation and the Treaty have published a request for Modern Hungary to the socialist party, the Danish Mihaly Foundation (TMA).
There were also 500-500 thousand forensics, but the quotes were not transformed to the objectives set out in the request.
That's not the way, the Works Team Kft has received five efficient accounts to the TMA.
These accounts were found in the office of home research in the office of the office of the educational office of the Serpent.
On the negotiation, one of the parts of the fact that it has been made in the business, it may probably be considered of the currency procedure.
It may be most important if you were the First Works, the Apostle John decided that the tree was over everything.
It's not too detailed in the same time, and even if he promised that he was talking about everything, he didn't do it yet.
Ask whether it's interested in this, after the large part of the cup, fifty billion rows in the head of his return, the socialists and the Zusi takes the bathroom.
Anyone who has already been disturbed, since it has been able to reduce its circumstances, the requests for the place of the household were constantly found in ears.
While a lot of greater carried out, and it cannot be reversed economic crimes, or at least in their own homes, they may expect the end of the procedure against them, and he has no possibility for this.
The psychology of overlining: why do we give more money?
In the markets, the purchases are to pay more money, to exceed the price.
This known - and, obviously, irrational - the neurological economy bases were made to include the neurological and public researchers of the New York Universe.
According to their study shown in the Science address, people don't want to remain in a type of concurrence such as eBay cutting, so they also pay too higher price.
Research tried to graph the "game" internal system scheme with the test akusions.
One of its own groups was driving, the other group was part of the game struggle, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) was tested by the active fields of experimental persons.
In both games, the participants could take money, but in the game, in which the element is essential to the other half overlimitation - the name of the strriatum, the same basic complex was intensively working on the loss of the game.
This brain area plays a role with more other functions in the "playing" mechanism.
The investigators say that the price may be explained by the reaction of the stritum's low reaction.
In order to submit their minds, the members of the Governor Group have also continued financial investigations.
These three groups licitalized against a partner between different circumstances.
With the control group, it was just informed of how much real value of the product concerned and they had made their tags.
In addition, another group promises that if they are openly out of the game, they will pay for $15 more.
However, the third group has received $15 before the auction, but if the members of the group were lost, the money was lost.
So the differences between the two groups were all so much that the reward for one of them had been voted to the other.
However, with the hypothesis of neurologs, members of the group playing against the "persease" were also higher teams for the control and the "neur" group.
"These results are not able to lead from the imagination of the earlier economy.
The same is the same, with the joy of my wine and the risk reaching, explained the existing opportunities to be achieved in the ransom.
Only the neurological images methods have helped to resolve the contraction between these two theory that we have now come to a third interpretation", Dr. Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Government Faculty of the New York University.
Hepatitis: When do we return to the doctor?
A couple of half billion people in the world are suffering of chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, the driving causes of death are exempted.
The number of inherent hepatitis feeds can be possible, but only a week, for which: patients often don't know that they were defected.
The name of the hepatitis nomination of various viruses is a collection of consumption products.
In their purposes, many of the similarity, indicators of eggs and diseases, but the corroxors and the diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are dependent on two main forms of corroxing: the hepatitis A and E in the tablet (e.g. with feeding food, water), the hepatitis B, C, D and the other virus with blood and bodies (ondo, eggs).
The travellers are increasingly able to protect A and B virus, there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A toneties two-3 weeks after consumption of feededed food, generally bad centres, poverty, housing panice, quantity.
After these, the visibility of the skin and the white branch, the smoke is light, the water is dark, and the health can be preserved for two-3 weeks.
Millions of people died in the world in the most severe disease of the chore, the hepatitis B was occupied in eggs and math sugar.
This is the principal cause that all the tenth defects are only medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also be very serious consequences: if you do not be treated, you can also lead to eggs.
Most defects don't know about the disease, because the cracks are destroyed subtractly, in many cases only 20-30 years will be reported to the first infections.
So then it is very important for the early prevention, the implementation of regular filter tests.
Three groups are better than the average: people transmissed in blood, drug consumers and technology before 1991.
The number of chronic hepatitis C virus has been defected in the present world of 200 billion.
Since the disease has already shown a rutin laboratory test, it is impossible to return to the hospital.
When the disease is recognized, the virus can be explored from the organization, so the ability of the fuel is disappeared and prevented.
On September 30, the hepatitis world day which first made the patients representatives in the world in 2004.
It is expected to call the attention of the viruss to the importance of chronic massage, expression and the importance of an early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, is it a little hurt?
According to a fresh research, religious faith works as a failure of pain, which has already been able to facilitate the death of Catholic marriages.
The scientists of the University of Oxford have been fulfilled with interesting experiences, and they have examined how God’s faith affects the pain of people, reporting the British Telegraph.
In an electronic examination, 12 Catholics and the same atheists participated in the electroscope framework, while they were all studying a festival of a filter Maria.
According to the results, Catholic faithers were able to remove the great part of pain.
Thanks to the human cerebral technology that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for the regulation of pain.
The first study is a research series in which scientists, philosophy and theologists are part of the different parts of the unit.
The test was exactly achieved that a smoking device was strengthened to the left hand of the experimental lens, which served the electroscope.
Researchers are considering the participants in the experiment to look forwardly on two pencils by the Sassoferrato Filter Mary and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The test manufacturers hoped that the filter Maria’s view would be a religious state between the fellow believers until the da Vinci image was chosen, because they were not very different from others.
During that time, the experimental travellers were held half hours on a MRI scanner machine, 20 electroscopes were received in the following four of each other, while the religious theme or the general pictures were looked.
Katholics were considered that during the vision of filters Mary they felt "security" as of those who were "beaten" and "beaten, he filled them with peace."
During the view of the religious theme pictures, 12 percent were considered smaller pain than when Leonardo had seen the creation before you.
Miguel Farias psychologist, who also participated in the study, thinks that a similar effect can be obtained by any strong effect, even as the atheists, only to find the appropriate photograph.
"We should find a picture that's very positive to feel like a mother or a dad." "The psychologist said.
Tom Wright welcomed the result of the research.
"The faith should be treated and change our personality in many cases." "Wright made him.
After the great results, the question is that if Leonardo or a similar calibrator shows a madonna image to the faithful, which would be the effect of their pain regulations?
Does Maria's Quality Filter indicate better results?
You're what you're part of yourself.
On the tenth birthday, you can tell Google: people can find at least as much as on their heads on the sky; you know where they were vacationed in what scenarios and what they're interesting.
And this isn't yet enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the main men of the company.
However, as regards sceptics relating to the orwell smoke, they don't see the Web 2.0 elements.
In recently, Eric Schmidt explained to the Financial Times that Google is the most important goal to collect more personal data from their users, and it is necessary to keep you in the original goal of Google basers, which sounded: "Let's all information in the world!".
According to the Google Manager, the company has been a 10-year-old worldwide worker, even on the beginning, it is only that you can handle all the information.
The question, what's going on five years ago, Schmidt replied: If Google could answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What work will be really to me?", but they can't even answer the software to such simple questions because they don't know something about users.
There are no Internet contacters with him that the Internet searches are exactly replaced by searchers that they have searched from what IP address they have been searched and whose website the interesters have been removed after the search.
During the two years ago, the users have been trained by personalized search, for example, can be able to maintain their own smoking backs, they can see what they have clicked, and they will generate a lot of more personal findings to them - the Recommendations will also be based on the same logical basis by the Recommendations, which give us the system of products and services and services that have been used for us.
What if they use my data against me if you see what I'm doing?
In most cases, the potential powers that the company represented by the company may be exhausted, not the crime, the fear of sin, the freedom, and then changes the reactions in the Internet.
However, the fact confirmed that all searching expressions are not only raised, but, in the case of the third party, they can also be given, in such legal cases, the rights of the Internet persons are nothing protected.
The most severe example of recent times may have been a combination of actions against Brazil Pedofils, which in the time Google has published the Brazilian Government on the community website named Orkut, related to pedofiles, allowed to identify information.
However, the Internet concerned for personal rights could still be able to explore in May when the company tested the EFF electronic organization with a successful evidence in the case of the Court of Justice against the FBI: These are, according to Google, it is not possible to prepare in the later parts of the party that the FBI has requested any information in your secret.
(Only, the Covenant Government had played a number of five thousand web addresses and thousands of searchers expressed in order to ensure that the child protection law has been adopted for years, but yet it was not possible to provide search lists of individual users, or the full web and key list for two months.)
So it is possible that Google's judgment: they're cut off those who hold their personal data, because they feel that their intim shops and their souls are able to be able to use Google services, and they're in the conzervacy simultaneously exposing the exhibition of multisecs in the conzervacy.
Moreover, the American geek culture and many countries showing, housing computers, activists, users are increasing the following generation of the grandparents, the "energy corporation" in them, in contrast to rivaly, Microsoft as a worldwide driver for Windows, all of them will fight for the same purpose.
This may be because Google doesn't ask a code identifier from users in separate way from Microsoft, don't ask money for its appliances, open, increasingly updated sources and software groups are much more available, younger, more than six of the official software manufacturer.
However, it may also be possible that the Genesis transmit exactly the personal rights and the very problem of the Internet, which is the point of the key in one of the past years, on the web 2.0 after you.
The web 2.0 does not say the same thing about the collection, that we want to leave pressures after us and use the communication camps that are available for us, and while these measures are changed as one, it is the same: we show yourself.
A common young man can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xanga, which can also connect to other services such as Twitter, or music listing with last.fm, and then all of them will be able to enter in the tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which automatically appear to the most photography of the Frlickn or Picasan.
Finally, we can read a number of examples from which: the girl is easy to consider the common friend's surroundings of the morning photograph, seeing that his friend has filled her out of the evening or can spread a company worker only because he wrote his real opinion in his blog on the top leader: a sure, self-controlled at this time.
He who lives online lives is from what she shows you, so we can accept a different basis after being conducted by young people today.
But whoever wants to hide something or at least wants to go to the Google monopole, it can do (e.g. uses the Google search system, but the same time does not allow Scroogle).
Not less, for example, the number of people who are not registered to community pages to not interfere with them, the Google online applications from the text editor to the displayer and the newsletter can be selected with alternative versions that are not connected to the original organisations and which are not allowed to interfere with the best existing profile.
The community doesn't expect so secret when Google shows his white branch.
The company has more than 156 billion dollars than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the AdWord/AdSense announcements are protected by the invoice of records, and the services that are introduced in a fast temperature are not only to Microsoft, but also a number of other structures.
However, critical experts are also found the powerful contrasts of the unexpectable points: the higher leading, for example, rejected the interaction of the applicants, after the duplexed the currency of the currency, found too costs for the companies that applied in the day-to-day multiple measures, but all of them are disappeared with the fact that Google has reached the customs rules in 2006 and that the costs were made in respect of all that they found for the goodness, and their costs.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that they don't predict a new service before, only when it is already possible, but it is sure that the next months and years of entire problems can be moved to the world: while some think that the Google books and magazines and archive projects have killed the sizes that the company must be quickly killed with the United States Supreme Court to be respected, others are more fully healthy from the Health system.
And the fact that Google's genetic database is built, the next generation of the sci-fi writers can also give a good basis, the popular Cory Doctorow, the Scroogled point of orwell sounds of the future, which only a man can be able to be closely accessible from the Google data.
Two young people helped two murderers in the pressure
Two young people have heard the police in the case of a two-shirt murder, according to the condemnation of criminal pressures, said Borsod's headquarters of the Forsod's headquarters.
Youths have known their dealings, and they are currently condemned with crime.
The two young - the MTI information says that two girls are freely protected.
The offence of crime may also be punished by the loss of freedom for five years.
A 23 - year - old local man was able to arrest the first arrest.
First of the planned, freedoms, many human murders are condemned by sins.
In the investigation, the 23 - year - old young man had a 53 - year - old man.
The ransom didn't want to respect his maintenance, so his creditor was attached to a half-year-old telephely where he was done with him, and also with the 9-year-old girl.
According to the MTI information, the young man was prepared for the commitment of criminals, and it also indicates that he followed the murder of the local gun.
The police tests the circumstances of the weapons and use of the police.
A proposal for the maintenance of the labour
Two hundreds of million euros - about five miles of chicken corners - recommended the valuation of the valuable rate of a hundred percentage of the employment.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw, confirmed the recommendation that the breasts had made that the challenges were deleted early in the workshop of the new properties.
That's why the barshot is in the state hand.
99 per cent of the parties is in the hand of the ship state which will give more than 60 per cent of the papers under a few months.
The E15 Czech Economic Sunday knows that the advice of the spirits is the highest quantity that the interesters have been recommended for the workshop.
According to the boards of Cheeh, the transit box of Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Box and the Deutsche Börse offered an advice.
Peter Koblic, the employee's officer in the past week, explained that the interesters of the customers would be the worst new property, and not concluded that in the future the practical values could be disappeared.
The employment value is 5-10 billion corners of the market experts.
On the basis of the Agreement of Particular Agreement, more than 90 percent of papers could be sold.
The most important property of the employment is the investment bank of Patria Finance at least 25 percent, followed him with the Céska Sporitelna bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. 13,5 percent.
From the European Leaders on Financial Crisis
The European tabs, leading in their sacred international financial crisis, have already been mentioned “the second September 11”.
The global financial katastrophe can thank the President of the United States - avoid Roman La Repubblica - the President had not yet been able to argue his own party, but after a law proposal in the section, which has gone to the hospital...
Instead of Pearl Harbor, which was published by Warren Buffett's billion investment, is more than the second September 11.
Madrid's a part of the madrid's seen the crime in Washington.
According to the view of El Mundo, the missing political leadership has achieved the world's economy to the assembly.
She's a woman who's part of the American financial system is the danger, and then the world will suffer it.
The Bush plan was not the same perfect, but the convention vote was immediately dangerous that Washington was not a political tool to treat the crisis.
The World Economic is a lot in the air — just when one of the largest transactions of the capitalism story.
There is no longer to leave the age-days-Anzegger.
Certain States can reach a relief to support funding institutions today, and they can save them with the money of suppliers from the room.
But if there are more banks in the same way, the money equipment or any other currency will not be sufficient.
The European Union Member States have longer needed to overcome themselves on their national dimensions and focus on the supervised financial markets.
Only a weekly more than 100 billion euros have received the valuable financial institutions - reminded of the Peace Der Standard, which, in fact, are more realistic that the American donors should also be able to deeply in their children for the medicine of the crisis.
The EU has not been seriously employed with the crisis that is a cunamial to the old land.
The "sufficiencies" should not be able to rob about hundreds of billion euros, but it would be good if it would be: in what case it is easy to achieve the money of the suppliers.
The smart car is imitated by your driving airport
What would be the best way to develop technologies that are appropriate to combating if they are not followed by the products of the nature in the world?
For example, the smoke.
In the surprised project CEATEC in Japan, the weaponous weapons have given the strategic examination of the Nissan measures to establish the next generation of the systems of conflict.
In cooperation with the toxic university, Nissan builds the type BR23C, bioutan automobile control system, a robotized mini-minister that was closed with the wood properties, with the final target to help a system to help all interference.
In the airport, every meal develops your oil-personal area which really is very similar to our safety burk - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, Technology PR and research developer.
It is important to see the skin's eye that can be seen in over 300 steps of view in every direction.
In order to copy the combinated eye function, the dimensions have become the idea of the laser training idea.
For this BR23C, 180 steps in 2 meters in the field of visa, identifies the academies, calculates their distances, and sends a sign to the feeding microprocessor, which is immediately based on the operation of the struggle.
Under the second interval, the academic recognition will eventually occur, then, after the moving of the meal, it will immediately change its borders with a significant reduction necessary for combating.
In any way separate from the current system, this seems to be completely increasing.
"If it wasn't so, the car robot couldn't be so quick to react to the cases," says Toshiyuki Andoh, Mobilita's Laboratorium and the draft project leader.
It is essential and immediately necessary to react, since this technology is the most vulnerable and the most appropriate level of safety, a figure in which the convention is currently unreasonable.
The whole process must be able to explore what a smoke is doing for it to explore other eggs.
This process must be done under a spectrum.
However, in a different way from the skins, the distance cannot be directed up, bottom or transparently, only two-dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotativeness of the cercles.
In such ways, in place of unable to be available for other eggs, there is only the movement and speed of the road, and the delay was applied as a possibility available for the vehicle.
BR23C uses lithium-polimer assumers that are easier and greater than their energy failure, which means that their lives are longer than the change of liquidium-on.
Andoh says that the artificial intelligence reaction is important, not the ability to maintain data, not even less.
In seconds of this structure, all of the income signs must be working and reacted to them.
It is not necessary to ensure them and to react with the logical logic based on the data of the previous drivers, so it continues to use several kilo-based memory.

However, the officers of banks expected to help the problem may be considered that their outcome money, which is a simplely calling to the golden steel, limits the government.
The restrictions of payments are only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how to help the Financial Ministry.
In the context of the restrictions, it means that if the Ministry is buying in the framework of the Auktion, the majority will be carried out to the gold carrier, if it does not be quiet for the levited bank.
When bad faiths are directly buying, the government will be in agressive way to ensure that the leaders' money will not be lost.

The right side camp was incomprehensive, but only the electorers were in the camp, so the Der Spiegel exploited the CSU in Bajorland.
They are prepared for the Government of Austria to explore the red-wheel coalition.
The speed (splay.de)
The Baloldal German newspaper, France Walter, in Bajorland, is described in the book of his parents in the case of the CSU dramatic affliction.
According to the known polythologist, the CSU erosion has already started that the summer Beckstein-Huber had been transferred.
Christian socialists have renewed Bajorland - and now these modern citizens are turned away from them.
The change is the whole Christian democracy, so the problem of Angela Merkel.
The sugar was not amazing for the CSU, but for the end of the Sunday, a process that was at least ten years properly properly properly: he lost a state invisible hemogony.
10 years ago, in 1998, CSU 47,7% landed, first under 50% levels from 50 years.
This repeated three years in the 2005 Bunnesstag elections, so it was still in the same stoiber box.
That is why the CSU has finally implemented modernization, which falls down their parents.
Sociologists have come to this for 40 years, but in the time they have made a great degree. However, without consequences, the electorers have not yet been able to be faithful to the CSU’s faithfulness of the CSU, the education results, the integration of east and north areas in Bajorland.
The modernization goes together with the growth of opportunities, and the political consequences are also visible.
The right side camp was incomprehensive, only in the camp, the electorers were the most self-profit, critical, self-experiencing.
In the last weeks, the classic citizen groups have been departed from the CSU; free employees, industry, nutritional and higher employees.
It's been under 40 percent of the CSU support.

Jorka - according to the Fides EP representative group - advertised that their primary low school education continues to be disappeared from the work market.
"The most of Rome young people have no central execution, and in the consequence of the bad quality education, they can only have an unreasonable part of their higher execution."
He also rejected that as a fundamental human rights, education has a key role to ensure other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Rome children can indicate the strengthening of the economic of the European Union Member States.
The representative says that these connections are necessary to be identified between the most severe rooms and not Romans.

CSU: Friends to transition
At the end of October, they decided about the chair of the Huber-Beckstein
In contrast of the choice box, the basic CSU clusters were not cut off.
Erwin Huber party and the governor of the region of Günther Beckstein can still stay in the place, a question forever.
In the last week of October, the 17% of the catastrophic growth is decided to be a convention outside the meeting in the end of October.
Many judicial members felt all of them: they don't take all their grounds on their throne.
This is the reason that the Fraction and the Basic Basic Deputy members were intended to explore personal conceives after the "bajor cunami" for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even with Edmund Stoiber manager, who was in the field of his bondage, - the Christian social Union has produced 60,7 per cent, but now, after a year, a 43.4 per cent of their dreams, a year after Stoiber’s puzzle.
The CSU was 46 years ago a "reporter" of the German GDP was 18 percent in Bajorland.
In addition, the concerts are also higher numbered for the Hungarian economy in the southern area, and they are increasingly coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the Party, the Chairman Horst Seehofer and the Communities Agency of the Chairman of the Chairman of Huber is located in the Chairman, which is intended by the Liberal FDP, or with the right-handed values of the Freedom Researchers.
The row's strange fintor is that the Freedom Responsors were in the list of the law, Gabriel Pauli, who used Stoiber as a couple of challenges, and they were unexpectedly disappointed with a great super-governmental policy.
The CSU leaders now transform all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, the active role will also be taken by Stoiber, which is achieved from the Background, the political advice of the previous Government of the CSU members of the political party of the CSU on 28 September.
Huber's comments on the CDU on a week-of-shirt, he believes that it would be more support than the brother's card.
Other CSU politicians declared the ability to warn the CDU and Angela Merkel.
In September 2009, Markel is not officer if the CSU who plays a significant role in 2005 with a common force of CSU playing a large role in 2005.
According to Markel, the CSU's destruction is not negatively able to exceed Berlin's big coalition.
Of course, the CSU is not easier to handle, but social democracies have continued.
With 18,6 per cent of the SPD, the most easier results in Bajorland since 1946.
Lukasenko-relation: 110-0
A single advisor has not come into the White Parliament after the vaccinational elections.
According to Russian superintendents, this Germany Lukasenko has ensure that the European Security and Co-Communication Organization (EECS) has been established in the statement of voting.
The EBESZ sent 450 supervisor from 43 countries did not recognize the elections.
Although the 10 million people’s main law has been made without the decades of the contrasts, the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously reached that, in the presence of the construction transformation, Lukasenko, the President of the 2006-based purchase elections in the fourth times, Lukasenko reached the "megeneous" representatives in this Parliament.
The ODSZ has also been exceeded from the preceding measured bowl.
Following the anticipated expectations, there was a view to that economically depending on the Russian Belarus, which believed in the measurement of the continually dramatic russical agricultural imports, and contributed to the advancement of the Belgian Russian Russland, Belgium, to promote the export to the EU, where the antidemocratic white-quality policy measures have been attached to Luke and more higher range policy.
The EBESZ, initially, urged that, when the election campaign assessment of the election campaign, was more positive movements, not to the mistakes, for example, to disappear the triangle of the anti-election.
However, the EESC’s week-end speed has already taken the campaign - in which the contrary marked could not be shown in the challenge - and in particular that the contrary could not be shown in the statement of votes.
In this contrary, however, an emotional progress in the political system: the political captains have been freely attached to the smaller confrontation of the Moscow, and continued to reach the South-Ostécia and Abhazia, when Russia - which has been involving the two areas for a month ago.
- We have made two steps forward, one back, but the most important thing that your dialogue has started between White and the EU -- said we're staying to Aleksandr Milinkevics.
According to the contrary mark of the President of 2006, it is required that it remains, in contrast, "the power has been threatened that the unreasonable Parliament may also be put into an anticipation."
The controversy is trying to reach a message on the need of economic reforms to the electorers after seeing the results.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the contrary maps in Russia, to explore the local authorities, but I also see that more supporting the changes, even in the age-- said Milinkevics, in order to review Lukasenko, which is the most important result of the creation of social security, even the official lowly supported reactions.
- The sale of the country, the growth of trade deficits, the time question of the social security of the "increasing steel" - Milinkevics.
In contrast to the contrary policy, the Russian superintendents have democraticly highlighted the elections.
Sergei Lebeziev, leader of the Mission of the United States, said to Ria Novoszty Russian officer, "not to the words, but to the facts believe people," so the contrary is not the evidence of the worthwhile of the white choices.
Brunetta: "Reguel only before work."
In the history of Chigi Palota, the travellers were in a single way to achieve the out and income of workers.
Since today, this new measure will be done against the customers, those who are blocking and then go to drink a coffee in the workshop.
Today, Renato Brunetta Minister of Administration and Mauro Masi, Minister of Ministry.
"Their markets - said Brunetta - the right and more effective work, the reduction of losses and the increase of services."
"Now, more responsible and transparent time.
That's the real reform." Brunet's sounded.
The Chigi Pallot ends the maintenance of all buildings of the Ministry.
Masi says, "the achievement of the tracks is also important from the symbolic point."
We didn't have experienced the contrary of the applicants - the main title strengthened: "Workers have placed the measure, everyone has cooperated."
At the same time, in the morning's work, there's no more coffee and brio.
Brunetta advises: "There's a good kid of capuccino tomorrow at the week, it's possible to wonder."
The Romical Court of Association
In the advice, the Ministry stated: "In three months, 50 per cent of the disease of workers in the center, which is more than sixty thousand heads of the year."
He brought the same time that it should be more efficient to the Italian administration
"Whoever beardynamic - according to the Ministry - in the last 8-10 years, it was twice like his self-shirt, and he was well overcoming the inflation ratio."
In addition, more than thousands of employed gathered together, connected by the Italian Environmental and Protection Units, supported by the Agency of Protection and Protection to combat the provisions of Brunetta Regulation.
"Because the Ministry of Administration is respected by the recovery of disease disabilities, the "inflationable planners" war continues to grow." writes the Consumer Protection Unit.
It has established more than thousands of respective and severe administrative administratives in order to communicate wars to the unlawful provisions of the Regulation."
In addition to the regional administrative courts, there are more than the elimination of the complementary table to the disease of the services, the increase of the time of the time of the home-term employees in the disease, which means the period in which the patient can be shown, and more, otherwise, the new provisions provided by the Ministry.
Munkahelian balances: Napolitano says that prevention is more important than everything
In Italy, there are 2,500 workshops every day, from three deaths, and 27 with a sustainable rate.
According to the employment insurance data, about 1,200 dead in 2007 in the employment areas.
The numbers testify about a seriousness that is still one of the most recent dead causes, and at least two times requires sacrifices as human killing.
Today, the day of the victims of workshops held on the second week of October, in all the events of the Anmil 58, the day of the victims of workshops held to call the institutions, social organizations and the communication on this dramatic problem.
"Anmil's aware data and tragedy events of the last days are also understood that there is an important role for the workshop in the preventing of the labour," reported Giorgio Napolitano community President Peter Mercandelli, the President of the United Nations Balese Rokkantan.
Instead, the State Chief described the "the proceedings of the employee advantage, the interest of the workers who have suffered the worstness, the reduction of their families of victims and the consciousness of the community."
"Perfectly and increasingly divided disagreements will be raised by everybody with such a significant dimensions, including the interests of the media and the interview, but in fact, we must be considered in the fact as the daily dromes, again and renewable cases."
Napolitano is openly entitled: "We fight with the resources, a decision to finance education and information.
Furthermore, it is important to the school initiatives that are directly designed by young people who are in the field of entering the world of work.
Our opportunity to maintain the interest in the present, not to allow the attention to the social importance of the question and to need more effective legislation that should be taken into account.
President Gianfranco Fini said about his part: "When the workshops of the death are severe, all of us are considering social importance, and the institutions are declined to take the end before."
"The data on the worksheets shows a lot of progress, but the number of such ancient dead is still highly high," says Peter Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We don't want to do the same time, if this reduced tendency, we'll be able to cut down, because the point of the attention is happening when the biggest tragedians are exposed."
"Let us consider that in general levels, we do not always do everything for the exploitation of the present, which would be resolved in a compatible action program.
We think that it would be necessary for more monitoring and checking, and that Mercandelli has sought to be more marked in the field of work education, already started from school education."
"We need more strengthening in order to provide information and review of the Communities" he also made it.
However, as it would be necessary, a more responsible worker environment is against an existence that is a social level problem."
Following this, Mercandelli judged "the focal protection of the victims of laboral balances" and the "provisionary directive which is in the past years the system has been subjected."
"The objective is, therefore, that we return to the workers' security, because the line of losers is not depending on where the laws are, and where they are part of the measures."
MP3 Players can explore audience chain
Maradaning hearing can be able to listen to a longer time and high volume, such as MP3 preparations -
published in Brussels on the report published by the European Commission, the new and re-identified Health Committee (SCENIHR), which has been published today.
"The explanation is explained that 5-10% of the rest of the 5-10% can suffer a hearing carrier for those who have been in five years a longer time for one hour, with a high volume of sound sounds, reading their sound players in the presentation.
"It's amazing that youths who use a lot of music players and mobile phones, they are not clear that they can be able to lose their hearing unreversely," says Meglena Kune.
"Scientific exploitations indicate an increasing risk that we need to react firmly," the Union's security was fired.
The most important task is the information of the consumer and a widely distribution of information related to this.
In the light of the examination, we must also examine existing control systems to work and step with the most recent technologies."
Brussels requested the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem with regard to the growth of training players and the increase of the number of young people exposed by them.
"The researchers ensure that we are concerned, and the European Commission is ready to examine with the Member States and the interested maritimes in cooperation with how appropriate measures can be implemented by the children and the similar tools for the protection of young people" said the Commission.
The European Security Rules in the present case sets up in 100 dB the maximum rate that can be exhausted by the players, however, the increased energy is required of the data on the use of such significant sound resources.
In the same time, the solutions such as reduction of the level and time limit, which may be significantly reduced by the hearings.
The EU's Scientific Committee expresses that the use of the hardly playing equipment for those who listen with high volume (except than 89 decibel) will exceed the maximum value of currently available in the workplace.
If someone hears the music between similar circumstances, it will be the danger of the rest of hearing.
This is about 5-10 per cent of those used to be used, which may also refer to 2.5-10 million in the EU.
Rome, Germany, establishs the Committee responsible for the future of the Maintainer
Today, it's beginning until March, the results are expected in June.
This procedure was fired by the Government of the Prime Minister for the operation of the "Rome's future of the Rome's Rome's Flood" committee, which has been assembled in a new place after the Caracalla campaign.
In the next six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Members of the Commission shall consider Rome's directives.
After March's end, in the collection and the Government Committee, the study and plans shall be evaluated in June to provide officially an approved major strategic plan for the Government and the Government of the Germany.
"It is a completely independent committee in which all of the political, social and cultural ideas are intended to take place in Germany - to work for proposals on the ideas of the Rome's development, which can support political decisions, so the Communities and the Government Committee.
There is no word about any effective unreasonableness, but we would like a platform where Rome's advice can be born with great plans.
In March, after he completed his work, the Commission will be divided, because it will be made with the mandate for the time.
In June, the Commission's strategic plan based on the employment of the Rome's Rome's Rome Plan - has published the main citizens.
To those who judge the Commission's operation, the Commission claims that the exhibition of which is not committed with the obligatory force, Germany answers: "All of the fact that the Commission will do, and what proposals he will take on the table.
If it is appropriate, only in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I take insurance in the case of Rome, it will be a important role of contribution by it.
Political rules are often disrupted in the preparation of day cases and in the treatment of events from time to time.
In this regard, we also look at a lot of views, and we are planning longer, and we work on the development and the future of Rome."
The Roman citizen wants to move to "the Commission can't be able to be able to "water" in the case of fullness, the Roman citizens will not be able to enter into a euro, and to serve consideration, and to do the most important mental minds."
Germany says the same, "the need is a open and rural strategy framework, which allows our city to make the colourful ground that would be so needed about the future of a single spirit."
On the future, on which Rome's citizens says, "not only the current self-governmental frameworks will be limited, but much far away," not only the metropolis and the major state of the officer, but "the role that can be loaded as the main area of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean, and what it is necessary to be fulfilled."
Obama, the first American president, we'll show you why.
A known American politician, which is independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second American President.
Jimmy Carter was the first one who decided the American economy with his decisions, and he made a lot of relationships (as it also makes it as a man today) with the enemy Islam."
As the time of the elections is close, the attacks against Obama will be disappointed.
A lady Miami wrote this on the Internet, "This man is full of emisions.
Obama believes that a nation could be the most highest national importance of this government and five senators for the future."
These attacks are actually nothing to say; of course, rassist signs, but they do not answer the voters' question of whether it is a good President. Then there are communities: it means that Obama will be raised, but it is a significant higher.
It's in this case who hears the feelings and doesn't listen to his mind.
In the southern United States, a missionary newspaper wrote this in the office: we know well that in the vote cabin, the true American home is the vote.
The American thinking mode shows a side here which remains hidden in the last moment.
"If you speak what you want, then we know what we're going to do to Obam or McCain."
There are those who swear to him: if Obama goes, they will leave the United States.
They have never sounded such words until this day when the black marked can almost be sure.
In the same time, against all disasters, the democratic weapons are George Bush.
They asked 1500 people about what was wrong under Bush's official time? 89 percent answered Iraq.
America's changed.
This nation lost 50,000 catons in Vietnam, and it was so struck that he flyed home.
He lost his life in Irak, and the Americans didn't have to smile.
Most people still think that Iraq was Bush's a lot of points.
The horizon's job waiting for George W.
U.S.: Economic companies have already feeled the newspapers, and the time of instructions has come in. Many of them are about the Internet, because the printed "Hola".
The PEW research institution asked five hundred American newspapers how they consider their future situations and spiritual powers.
Well, now almost every newspaper phase on its own future.
However, they did not make sure that the concerns were reduced by faith.
You don't feel so separated as before.
The problem of American newspapers is the money.
We think the conflict in 2008 is a strong economic model.
Another serious issues are reported to newsrooms, as well as for the newsroom editors.
If we don't want to make the reliable newspapers, in the sense that the great publicity is under this, you need to minimize this problem, - the questioned magazines say.
Management is well visible and combined pessimism of the American magazine.
In the printed officers and high leaders have six percent of the convinced that the national cirnalists are walking in a bad way.
On the local level, 65 percent of the journalists are in the high position of the leader.
Printed against an electronic flag.
Your employees are not difficult to see where the world network is going.
The biggest extractors are driving on their ways to the Internet, which many think that the printed tracking "the murder."
The newspapers have grown up to 79% of the "Economic Pressure".
The 500 issued newspapers found that the technologies are growing up, in the hope that it may be civilistic advice.
Today, in the American shipment, the structure leaders, as well as leaders, and their workers.
At the same level, 56% of the leaders are sure that their scientists also share their information with others while this is only available to 23 percent.
Some of this sure job is involved with them.
On a lot of level, 47 percent of the leaders are able to lose their work in three years.
In the case of the journalists, this is 30 percent of the rate.
In America, the question of "profit work" is continued on the teams (for our editors).
The journalists are only 13 percent of the Treaty.
In such a powerful country, as the 300 million residents of the United States, where more than thousands of news, travelers, radio, TV and Internet servers work, the workers are usually recommended as much as they want, so it works on the basis of the "self or not".
The leaders generally receive a high payment, and the editors can also look for ten thousand dollars, on the payment of the calamity and health safeguard.
The freedom, however, works in the first year: in the first year, the third day, even until a certain time, is not the maximum 15 days.
But the American newspapers, according to their own income, often in the year they're "beat."
Everything works on the ground.
UNIPOL: PROMATIONS: DANILO COPPOLE GROTTAFERRATAB MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Court of Roman Court, denied the request of Danieli Coppola, which would like to pass to a Rome dwelling place from Grottaferrat.
In the framework of investigation in the case of the Agreement on the Union - BNL Partition Agreement against Coopola.
Last week, the home guard was resolved during the starting procedure against him, and it was changed in the situation of residential residence related to Grottaferrat.
Agency, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested to travel injury to the main apartment of the vice-shooter.
However, according to the Court, these insights (as regards the proposal for the agent's refusal) would be allowed to affect and access their business cases to the evidence brought against it.
In danger
There was a few days ago when the Chairman had not voted more than 700 billion dollars from the White House: Americans had more interested in the most important part of the Americans, and still interested in the Wall Street's payment than saving the economy.
This supports the last night New York Times, which indicates that the destruction of the current crisis appeared in the Republican Parton, which shows a larger party of the reliable, renewable, renewed, renewed, employed institutions and business environments, supporting the East Party and the Middle and South States.
This Directive has been published in critical ways in the vote of the representative office referred to in the introductory.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that are present or seeing you in the United States, but not only in the entire west world, even if it is possible.
It seems that the crisis, the United States and Europe is just quickly quickly in the good time that they are in this new aircraft, and they will end up the sun.
The first presentation of such is the re-upgradation, the return of the two category of State sovereignty, in relation to the rebuilding of the economy.
The crisis is the same of the bank-financial institutions that have the same large relationship with the outer field, but first, and that is largely widely, people and families with you who live in one country.
This is, however, direct political difficulties for the government's existing ones: what answers to people’s difficulties and actions who also choose others.
So, in the economic understanding of the crisis, it looks like the same world size, but it is almost national in political understanding.
It seems that the political internationalism has been declined outside the part: this is a precious evidence of the European Union, which is not able to select a single policy guidelines between different interests and national strategies.
So then everybody waits for income, shipping, renewing and new rules, but mainly opening the financial funds: because only some states are regulated with economic resources, a financial equipment that can make it right to do things.
Their tools and their recognition are also to use these: in the case of these conditions, two non-comprehensive resources are provided, which, likely, no other market or any international organization will never be established in such amount.
Furthermore, the new vote of the crisis is fully consistent with that economic growth in recent times has a greater importance that is increasingly compatible with this food: and this is the area.
In the same way, as we were convinced that we have already entered the network, the most infinite technology gone into the world, and we were convinced that the global financial world has established that the world rule, once we had to notice that our future had more than one of our future, at least no matters than the water, the production and the colon.
From things that can be carried out from the same side of the planet to the other, however, in full a range of circumstances can be linked to a range.
Thus, whoever rules the area, has more cards than one who has been born in a place where there is no product, there is no rock and no water.
I'd also go back to the second newspaper that is a single challenge.
Who says that the area, the state, the government, the need to say, political, other words.
It seems that the Economic Crisis produces two compatible presents:
Instead, the objective recognition that it is necessary for faithful leadership, for those who can take the events into hand.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular economic leaders' full destruction, who have been fully inadequate and proved that many were still before them.
The two together is more important and more indecent in certain senses: the feeling of faith, the unbelieving, the incompatibility and the difference in more of the west countries of the entire leadership.
So it seems to be that the people are increasingly larger around the conference of the time of the society that has passed to the earlier, even before their works, their experiences, their life mode, their culture, the word complex, it would have done itsselves, and it would be better than the opinion of most people.
On the other hand, a manufacturer, but a strong delegation moves with the governor and the rural policy system, which has not expected to be "while" or in the last time in the immediate changes, such as the competitive powers in Austria and Bajorland, the employment unit in the Great Britain, or the Congress of the Bush's Congress.
It seems to be a lot of reasonable elements, parts, programmes, and also we could say that with its exploitation, his shipping and his famous understanding, it is less, so it can be less to consider that a time of the west society will end in the deepest areas.
Instead of all of them, it would be a lot of speaking "the smoking of the cups on the bottom".
But he opened his eyes, he wasn't worried.
We can walk in the wall with a supply guest.
With a surgery guarantee helping the gravitation and walk on the wall like Pookman.
This goal has been fired by more American research centres, and a group of four institutions are near to the solution.
A total of 2,5 square centimeters more exploited by the researchers had a 100 miles of body to a dependent wall, and there was.
TANULMANY - The Science address has published the daytonian unit, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and some researchers in the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance already found by the scientist group was born from the further development of structural materials in the area of N.E.
"We have to imagine as a group of spagettes like a group," says Zhong Lin Wang, the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers were covered by the feet covered with the gas microscope skins, the idea that ensures perfect assault for animals.
With various materials, such as with eggs, tephlon and cyclopical papers, tested that the new gainer has been more effective than the mentioned crazy farms, even though "leading out of the wall" - explains Liming Dai, the researcher of the daytonian actor.
FALON JARNI? - "This material can be useful as a temporary gainer" - makes Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, as the Pookman? Maybe yes, but the researchers think about a little more exciting use as the combination of electronic equipment, because the branches are well leading the heat and the electronic form.
You can find another application in the area of the exploitation.
Sovereigns can still wait.
MASIC KUTATATAS — the University of California Berkeley is also carried out tests with a new exploiting substance.
According to the American Chemical Society (c), California scientists showed a packaging from a mixed microscal substance, which went through the motion of the surface, so it ensures the perfect attack.
Medicines?
You need to be careful with grapefruits, narancs and materials.
These high vitamin contents, in particular, in the field, are populary nutritional foods, where there are some saved medicines in the organization, changes the rescue, depending on the effects of this, and this can also go with severe health safety consequences.
Professor David Bailey, the London University of Western Ontario, called to the attention. The professor reported on the convention of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia in 236 country: a grapefruit, narancs, or sustainable, reducing certain savings of life medicines to reduce this good effect and dangerous disease.
The grapefruit has already been able to focus on the effects of a toxic antibiotic, antihistamine, soronly reducing, heartritm regulatory and foreign medicine.
KOCCATIONS OF THE GOGESERK - Two years ago, you brought the Italian Medicinal Institute publicly in the official disease of the report, and one warned the doctors and the patients to take serious risks relating to this cooperation, and to watch what they drink in such medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEM CSAK The GRAPEFRUIT - According to the researchers, the narancs and the container contains substances that affect the efficiency of medicines.
The list of active substances may be long-limited by grapefruits and other fruit grapefruits.
It calls to the attention of Michele Carru, Professor of the United States Medical Agency: "There are generally signed to the various national and international medical institutions that, if necessary, ensure that the information of the given manufacturer changes.
That is why you need to always read your medicine information, and if something is impossible, we don't let us affect yourself, but let's ask our doctor or medicine clearly."
Paul Krugman received the National Nobel Day
The American Paul Krugman has received the public Nobel, trade models, and economic activity areas.
The 55-year-old Neokinesian Krugman, the Princeton University, teaches and known publishing the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the less courts of economic and external measures in the Government of Bush.
After the terrorism of September 2001, a couple of months when the Enron had gone to the road, Krugman stated that the last event would go to the history of the United States, as well as the collection of the industry.
This announcement was not a little bit of the vision, but the manager's eyes have been incredible, but today we know that it was exactly.
"I'm opened, and I'm a little bit so much that Enron or Worldcom's bottom assembly was too quickly going to go to the concentration," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
Member of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee on Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Krugman is a "roopant valuable guarantee", however, "in agressive style of liberalism against the overseer of the Government of Bush."
Open Office, also the third output of the "Microsoft contraes" team
Today, the OpenOffice.org 3.0 applies to a open program code, which is more larger than a Microsoft Office alternative, from office users, free employees to administration.
The new Open Office has been monitored by SUN Microsystem, and at least one year after its own developers, the new Open Office has been carried out with more new news: the welcome screen and the rearranged, less less spread users, also use more important news. For example, Apple Mac OS X operational system is compatible with the new, and supports the new ISO-based format (Open Document) format 1.2.
The Open Office may also open new Microsoft extensions (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, some specific modules, for example, are allowed to reduce PowerPoint indicators. This can be useful for sending a file on the email path. A different function supports importing in PDF files's graphical modules to save the local design.
We can also create "hibrid PDF" documents in this area, which compare the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
The distribution of the applications has also gone through several developments: the manager supports the common use of the workshops, but replaces its works. All employees are marked with other colours, which helps the easier understanding.
Some companies have already worked that OpenOffice may also be available from Internet (on the cloud, the cloud), so it may probably be shown in the next weeks.
The Italian version, after the paints of the mirror pages are already found by English, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program group is also available for Linux outside the special Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can also take the installation CD on our home or on our workplace.
As a result of the expansion of the home application, the ability may be the greatest exploitation, but the Open Office programme is now trying to steal in the business sector, as many of the managers and school projects can also be considered.
No ideal education, advice and administration services for small and central companies do not need to open new business payments.
The Open Office's five basic modules are: Writer, a suitable Word editor; Calc, the Excel Replacement Manager; Impress, PowerPoint presentations; the Dbase is similar to the legitimate, Access database manager; and, finally, Draw the graphical module.
The target of 2008 is to be loaded by 5 million downloads, but if we are sure that we have been able to show the new version of 3600,000, this number will probably be higher than the expectation.
It's also positive, that's the fourth dopping case
Tour de France was produced again a positive expression of one of the participants in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, who also opened the best mountain tricks near Bronze.
The newspaper has been seen on the site of the Internet magazine.
The 26-year-old Cohl was the fourth concurrent, the Italian Riccardo Rico and Leonardo Piepol, and the German, even after the Jerolsteiner, Stefan Schumacher, who produced the positive results of the third generation of the EPO.
The cool bloodminus, like tests in the past weeks, studied the lausene and chatenay malbry labry laboratorys.
If the control tests ensure the positive Cera results, the third position of the islands will be lost and, according to the provisions, two years will be disappeared from the consumption.
Peter Bordry, the manager of the France Doppingellen Agency, confirmed the positive results of the EPO trial of the Cohl, and sent down by the Associated Press Office of the Association: he reported the positive adjustment to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-year-old island Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans had been able to stay in a boot and opened the best mountain tricoon.
BEVANDORLING: NEW YORK TIMES FELTES AND THE SERVICE, THE BOOK SUBJECT?
It has been changed recently for one of the favorite objectives of the accepted investors in Italy.
This is the question of New York Times, which was the young Burkina Faso-in-Abdul William Guibre, who was killed in Milano in the past month, because he struck a box case - a long article around the Holy Rasism in Italy.
The case is well identified as the New York Times' "the paradoxy" named: "the highest integration and the highest employment" in Northern regions is also "the incoming ability and the support of the North Liga" here in the country.
The NYT has also occurred cases in Milano, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno to be submitted to the focality between the Italian and the invasors.
It's too.
New laws requested by the Liga, which would have been more frequently gained by the income and facilitate the explanation of illegal investors, such as the change of vote in Italy.
The tendency mentioned in Pape and the President of the Communities also says: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met Benede in the Quirinale place, and accepted that the State and the House work together for rassism."
Drawing bills are suffered by dicks, or 900 euros can be in a room
The universitaire's market of destinations does not affect the crisis.
According to the most frequency of the Sunia, Lawrence Office, a district may pay 900 euros for a single room in Milano, 700 in Florence, 650 in Napoli and 600 in Rome.
"The presentness has already been closed as an extraordinary dimension, which - because of the technical costs for families - decreases large dimensions from the opportunity of study" - explains Laura Mariani, leader of Sunia Student Officer. "In these cities, the high search of the diseases has so cut off the market, that it has been a general deal with the local rooms."
In most of the cases, the unrecommended recommendations also contain a line of non-registered or non-registered contracts, not containing contracts that are not registered, not included with the subvention.
Sunia should be required for a regular action that creates the possibility to maximize the prices when reviewing the data system.
From the detailed details, it is explained that in Milano, Brianza's around 450 euros are requested for a bed; from 650 euros from a total room (Bande Nere area) to average 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can also be achieved by 900 euros (Vittoria environment).
In Firenze, a bedroom has a average of 350/400 euro, a room at about 700.
In the blog where dicks live near the unit, a bedroom of 250/280, if it's double, and 370-500 euros, if it's a single room.
In Rome, in the nearest areas of Central Units (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), there are about 600 euros for a single and 450 bed in a double room.
The prices in the area of other units (Ostiense and Cinecittà) are more low (550 euros in a single room).
In the foreign borders, you can spread all: 300 euroba gets a bed and 450 in a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar rooms.
For a bedroom, they ask 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The room of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei is the highest area.
For a bedroom, Bari must be paid 250/350 euros and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, the prices are absolutely lower than the same, but they are more severe in the citizens.
In cities, such as Perugia, where other parts of the EU are often looking for a location, can also be achieved by other standards: the foreign districts requested for the foreign districts at about 25 to 30 percent higher than for the Italian branches.
Bye by the good old Cinema Paradiso, in cities offered the old mobile time
The multiples are locked in the front of multiples.
"The city where they are not moved, the white city, like a face without eyes."
Giuseppe Tornator's officer shows all that will be done in the Italian larges, but also in the video regions.
The smoking of the museum - showing a large, multiterm movement in the foreigners, and then, in the fields of the cities, the separation of the grounds will be increasing and unrevertable, but also brings a true cultural offence.
When historical and remembering locations appear, "It's like a friend who's gone, a known with whom we shared our way and many animals," says the Cinema Paradiso law. The movie, which has been raised for 20 years ago, and reported the biggest part of the Cannes feast, to Tornatore, a small mosaic story, reported the story of the aircraft, a moving way, which may be a movement, which might have been forwarded.
The most largest party of the operators, the data communicated by Anec, speak clearly: the 316-year-old film color room in the last five years. The largest loss of movies in the largest offices could be booked: 10 film rooms closed in Florence, 9 Milanon, Napoli, Bolón, Rome, 6 Torino, and 5 Palermo.
In the most interested regions, Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 aterm move, follows Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to disappear the multiplex reversation of the multipless, the responsibility does not prove better than the point of Italy in these three regions is the highest number of open multiterms from the new: in the last five years, the number of plans was mentioned in Lombardia, Toscana, 81 and the same as Emilia Romagna.
"The number of Italian units has grown in an irrational way," says Anec President Paul Protti. "There is that we have built new existences, but the existing ones should also ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when a citizen museum closer, not all traveling ships to multiplexs.
Not even talking about non-loaded financial funds for the support of operators: it can be available at about 10 million euros.
It is also threatened that the government does not include the legislation in the respective.
The market would be required for 16-18 million euros in the year."
This is the first Italian city, which decided in the concern of the closements that the external and internal migration is protected and agreed with the Agreement between the Government and Anec.
In the meaning of the provisions, the supplications provided for for operators and the preventions of the community to prevent the accessibility: the viewers can enter the limited branches and parks in certain parks.
"That's the starting," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, with any other measures, but they'll follow the example of Bolóna.
However, it is sure that the remedial moves to be able to take the battle with the rule of multiplexs, they need to advance the sound and imagination because the community today is better needed.
It was always important for me to ask: Close the Supercinema in Bagheria - where I made a child and a young man - he gave it the cycle that I finally did the Cinema Paradiso, about 10 years ago.
I live in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Nazial in the Rome, before Rialto or the Quirinale, to not see the pitched plaquets from the porch, so I'll turn my head.
A lot of rooms between the political and the 'andrangheta, arrested by the cityman of Gioia Tauro
"Gioia Tauro citizen supported the interests of the Piromalli Klawich with its own government decisions."
A severe accusation was made by the Chalbanian Maffiaele Officer Gioia Tauro citizens and officers, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno citizens of Carlo Martelli, who have been held in the outside party of the crime today morning.
Gioacchino Piromalli, clan and administration, and the same name with the chief, an advocate, who has already been sold in a maffia crime, and 10 million euros have been carried out.
"All law and legal rules, we also have more of the good deeds," writes the State attorney. The two local governments have opened the absolute intention to pay the payment of the consultors to the Piromal Agency.
"It would have been officially entered into the city's house, which would have given further opportunity to control and control the administration, which is already important to say.
Agazio Loiero, Chairman of the Calabria region collection, does not state that in the region there is a "combination between local institutions and the organizated offices": there are areas where maffia is stronger than otherwhere where it is almost impossible.
However, a lot of local policy is contrary to the "drangheta pressure, they are the heroes who remain clean."
Today, the arrests of July events have been continuous when the police also stated that the Piromalli clan had been completed.
At the end of April, the local policies have been saved under their mandate to guide their own government. Gioia Tauro has already been distributed once in 1991, as well as because of the conventions between the organizated crime and the local own government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a citizenship of Christian democracy at the release, came in the second translator of 2006 to live the right-central coalition.
He cried to Bothrain when Megyehaza established the distribution of the Government Committee.
In the presence of the Court, Marco Minnii was in place for the position of the office of the Office, and he concluded that he had planned everything in a political goal, but the Court explained in the mandate of arresting this morning, that the Piromalli had submitted to request A3 project changes.
The state officers are listed on the audience of Dal Torrione - that the state officers - that "he had an extension to make the requirements of companies representing the Piromal family at least closely, the government’s decisions to be under the clusters."
The energy comes from the balls, and the biggers are coming
An increasing energy source which makes 70 per cent of the planet level, and which is still achieved by the large international energy energy
Hulls, seawarms, arabs, and the renewable energy sources that have taken eyes like Chevron, who are now trying to raise their hands.
They have been looking for the possibility of how they could explore the energy from the sea movements. In the '70s, the first oil quality of the researchs were focused on.
In 1980, when the rock price was reduced, the idea of the use of marine energy was declined, but today the requirements of environmental protection and the renewing of the rock price gives the market a new level.
According to London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007, 15 per cent of the needs of the world's electrical area could be achieved with the use of the use of the sea consumption.
This is the quantity of the two times that the atomic vehicles are currently initiated.
It's still over there, the balls and the arabs.
It's in the bottom of the rooms.
The Enersis was the first company who was involved in the sea energy and submitted an agreement in 2005 on a power that exists in North Portuguese.
It seems to be a formal step when the signature was reported.
Two years ago, and once more companies have grown near the sea energy, among them also those who have been able to be able to achieve the resource energy.
"The Chevron studys the energy technology of the oceans, and makes the opportunity to cooperate with us.", reported the American Olympic Time of a company company, the Wall Street Journal Economic Day.
The questionnaire cooperation has been paid by the American Energy Energy Committee to provide the necessary permissions to ensure the basic project for use of sea energy.
The matter is not a little important, especially if we are sure that the United States continues to continue the rock-insurance in Germany, even the President Bush has recently introduced a plan for further fuels.
Outside Chevronon, the Verdant Power Inc. and the New Jersey Ocean Power also walks on the way of energy from the sea. The age-invested quotes are already invested, as much as you can know about the details, they make a witness of the growing interest.
The technology is waiting for a training.
The experts say that there is still a starting technology, and it is just because the energy that can go out of the sea does not deal with environmental effects.
The existing, Portuguese or Scosia exists all small sizes, therefore, in respect of the ecosystems, do not cause a big problem.
However, in order to produce energy in greater steps, there is required existences that are more important for environmental effects.
There are more possibilities: use the Ocean Power, for example, a connected shipping system.
The skins and the beaches have moved the movement of the smoking and the heavy pressure in them are increasingly hydraulic pressure.
The pressure takes a turbine, and it's a generator.
The electromatic area is coming to the ground under the sea.
For example, there are four similar representatives in the planning scene that are waiting for the agreement permissions. The energy planned would be used in a military existence.
Verdant Power, however, has already started the energy energy-investment center and a parking for the East River Sea River.
The movement of the water moves the turbines, and this transport moves the generator.
Verdant explained that there is a long list of partners who only wait for energy permissions to use.
It's arapic after the fucks.
The currently separated attention is to be concerned with the opportunities for the Arabic.
Sometimes there is a periodic presentation, the araphy is pre-previewable than the wind, the sun, or the skins, so it is possible for the trusting energy resources.
New York, Maine and Alaska, and the other parties costed $7.5 million in 2008, so for the expensive of the energy served by the Arabic. This is a total of 35 million women in 2009.
