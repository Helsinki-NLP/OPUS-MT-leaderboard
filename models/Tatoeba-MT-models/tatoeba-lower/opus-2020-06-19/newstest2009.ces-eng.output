Prash bubble has fallen to the end of the negotiation
After the morning, the smoking smoke was corrupted the loss.
Transactions with the CEZ actions have almost half of the regular trade.
The branch was immediately carried out from the beginning of the outer trade at its lunch evacuation when she claimed at least six percent.
This time after the bottom, the action is falling on Wall Street.
We also show the reaction of the market on the result of the voting of the American Representatives, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the financial sector.
Action Pad in Asia
Dramatic falls in the bottom are cutting activity in Asia, even though the indexes were lost in the day's past.
Independent Hong Kong has rejected at least four per cent in Hong Kong, but later the part of the loss, and the pool reduced 2,5 per cent.
Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese actions in Hong Kong, claimed to 3,8 per cent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sidney's tower action lost more than five per cent, but finally the loss was reduced to 4.3 per cent.
The torch on the Taj-wan, according to the entire index, was 3,6 percent.
"The time of safeguard action in the United States is imminent and affecting the financial market in the whole world," noted the captain of the Hong Kong Change Office of Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it's part of China, the variation policy defines itself, so without consent to the Chinese Central Bank.
Hong Kong has the same level as the United States.
The American lawyers should, according to the Australian Premier Kevin Rudda, rapidly return to the operation and the proposal of the support of the financial system.
Otherwise, it's horrible that the impacts will feel like another country.
Heading of the American actions
The American Snimovna representatives on the Sunday refused the plan of the financial system to be based to 700 billion dollars (all 12 billion Kč).
The lawyers so ignored President George Bushe's call to support the plan.
According to Bushe, the plan would resolve the basic reasons for financial crisis and helped to stabilize the whole economy.
The American actions in the Sunday have been raised by blood smoking and main action indexes have signed the largest fall for over 20 years.
Dow Jones' index cut about at least seven per cent and the event in the same area recorded the last in 1987.
The index has already claimed before the vote, but when it was shown that the proposal was not in a dream, the index was in a free fall.
Congress out: United States Government can pump 700 billion dollars in the bank
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the Government of the President George W. Bushe agreed on the largest form of a agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
To vote about it will be the beginning of the next week.
The American lawyers have made an average in talks on the approval of the Safety Plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system in $700 billion (by approximately 12 billion corners).
However, it's not yet scared.
The Congress have to conclude some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of law and vote about it.
The financial system's support plan will be carried out on the south of Snimov representatives in the Sunday.
In the week, Agent Reuters said that the President of the Committee for Bank and Financial Services of Snimovny Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to the resources, it would, of course, vote on the plan first in the middle.
Economies should be notified that to approve the safeguard plan, the first significant psychological factor for the reliability of financial markets.
But afterwards, it will be available to the "comprehension" thanks to the compatibility of mechanisms, as to help markets get in practice.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We made a great progress.
We resolved our various opinions about how it looks like the market stabilization package," she brought to Agent Bloomberg Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
By her, the final vote could be achieved on weekly.
The lawyer's procedures met with the American Financial Ministry of Henry Paulson on the evening night, in order to provide a definitive form of the Government Fund.
This should be sold from financial companies a non-product hypothesis activity that brings financial companies to difficult losses and enhances the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the further definitive agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's still in a healthy plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Asian trade signal
The global financial crisis is explicitly affected by action markets which are immediately fulfilled.
According to the non-advance Democratic Senator Harry Reida, the lawyers tried to increase the final agreement in the Congress.
They want to please investors before trade on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time period, where the Congress decision could affect the lunar trade.
However, it is not yet clear when both American Communities will vote to the law, or if they can not act on the last moment.
The lawyers hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still known for changes.
The total part of the system's support shall be divided on two parts.
Initial 350 billion dollars must be available to the first thing that will be possible as President George Bush requested.
But the Congres may block the release of the remaining parts if it will have that the program does not complete its function, and it will be for more than 100 billion dollars and later 350 billion dollars.
Bush estimated progress in operations
The President may also take this decision, however, the Congres may speak to his vote.
However, through these changes, the fundamental thinking of the programme, which was made to receive finance for the purchase of the bad hypothetic price papers, which the value has falled, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their hypotheses.
"We've done everything.
The Sweden representatives should be able to vote on the law on the week and Senate on the Sunday, "with the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
With progress in the exhibition, the American President Bush is peaceful.
His speaker Tony Fratto announced that Bush was with a so-called progress and assessssed "o-party trial to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economics."
Restrictions of gold falls
The President of the Bank Committee of the Senat Christopher Dodd, leader of the leader, said that the lawyers agreed to the responsibility for the money programme, the protection of payments from the loss, the closement of supply, the time of financing of the plan.
The new law shall also be limited to the golden failure for the director of the Community participants in the programme and ensure the Committee that will have a supervision fund.
This should be guided by the Financial Ministry.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made a great progress to the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is also calculated with the help of households who have problems with the problem.
The Government should issue new rooms in the hypothesis that buy, to reduce the monthly costs for the employees and allow them to leave their homes.
Marque: Psychological assistance
The plan is, according to the main economy, Patria Finance David Mark is a good idea, very difficult but it will be his implementation.
"It's because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problems will buy.
This will be determined for how to divide the losses of financial sector and government among themselves," he said this week for the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of the next week, it's not just like Mark.
"The most important is that the congressmans have already agreed that this plan will support and that they will make it clear what it happens before.
The psychological significance of the agreement that will be approved is the most important at this moment, "Marek.
MP3 player against mobiles.
We'll advise how to choose
While at least every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be able to phone.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
However, there are too many reasons for a person to order the other player.
The choice is fully involved in the way of use and advancement of the future manager.
Maybe you're hard to make a pick-bed graphphone to listen to the newest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products on the LPs are not exited and there are no objective reasons for this.
However, if in your rules, you may like to smile at minimum of such a graphphone, you may have a rock, or blues.
It's the same with music on the paths, so a music compressioned, simultaneously - music in MP3.
There are prices and quality categories.
For someone can be unacceptable to lose eight thousand corners for player, like Pink Floyd's fanus, like a hard test hearing for twenty corners from the market.
Two extréms, between which there's enough place for each one.
The selection is wide.
Decides and maintenance of battery
Some music players can control much more than only music playing but what most of the mobiles or agreement.
No current device is not so universal as a phone.
According to primary functions, phoneing and explosion, they can play music and videos, both playing, playing, better here, higher camera, and needs to prove and navigate.
And if we take smartphones and communications, you'll have a little computer.
It's a little surprise, because no aircraft can grill, and no television doesn't photograph anything.
The uniform of the mobile offers and inevitables.
How much more you use on the mobile functions, then you're the indicator on the display sending to the driver.
And music playing is one of the largest energy energy.
A little phone can play music longer than twelve hours, most of it is less.
In this Directive, music players (specially those most simple) are explicitly executed.
Therefore, in the left cells, calculate that they won't play you for a few hours.
If you're still here and call it there, get to work for a safe job - it's also paying for better devices.
In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even you'll have at least 9 hours of unexpected operation on one attack.
There is another problem when loading music into the mobile.
The restricted part of the devices is available to the Universal USB Concert, and not one of them can also be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music is possible to play directly on the memory card, but only a small card reader will be able to reduce the minimum memory cards that are used in the mobile cards.
You don't need special software for players until the iPod exceptions.
It's enough to fill music over USB from the computer.
Most of the mobile and players are already created by the music library based on the name of interpretation, the name of the alba, the chair or the need to evaluate the user.
Some devices show only the tree of directory structures similar to the Windows Explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are maintained, mobile more knows
If you choose a specific device, you may be interested in particular about the packaging, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, and of the control comfort.
If you're a music first and you're listening to it every day just a short time in the tram, you'll have any MP3 phone that plays.
What's really going to prove at least any phone.
You don't have to look at what music formats of the phone or player knows.
MP3 will control all and directly most music that will get to you will be just in this format.
It is the most larger and otherwise most tools can also be able to explore music in the WMA format.
Least AAC is presented (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile also allows the buying of music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant operator pages (or another provider) and a song or album to buy.
This service may already be an argument for musical mobile equipment.
Awesome, the offer of operators is mixed and is limited mostly to the fast radio of hite.
The prices are not less.
However, it is currently supposed that this way is just to sell music (with through GSM, Internet or without Internet) to the future makes music industry.
The majority of people's driving still at themselves.
When you can listen to something, you can grab the phone in the box while the MP3 player is living forgotten home.
However, it is still important if you always take a list or at least a travel handsfree with yourself.
If not, you can use the integrated player that has almost each cell, but only the minimum MP3 Players.
Maybe the largest output of music cells will be for a lot of prices.
You're the most lower ones are usually under three thousand.
Three and four thousand corns you're already ordering a very joyful fightman.
However, most of you will be limited to the absence of the exit to a regular hearing.
The best and technical phones and with 3,5 mm dinner for normal audience are 15,000.
The achievement of the players is more easy.
You're the only one - no need to be the best (see our choice) - the player can really control each one.
The minimum function, the similarity of control with the regular cash or the graphphone is considered.
It's not worse in the form of the rest of the mobile internet active and the ultimate account for data transfer.
What device to get
The most fair mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have the slot on the storage of memory cards (M2 type, microSD apod).
You're going to go in two thousand corners with the purchase of the relevant cards.
But take care of it.
Basic models are supported only cards with maximum capacity 2 GB.
Only those oldest will also agree with 8 GB memory.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy a MP3 player yet, shoot after Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't need to lose more than 1100 corners.
If you are looking at the most famous listeners, please take care of specialised mobiles - fightmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have a single control button for MP3 and the comfort of service is so close to the MP3 player.
It's closely in the Sony Ericsson camp, which the mobiles of the fightman's series have the same user interface as self-produced MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand corns, but with a larger memory capacity (beyond 16 GB) and keeps the akumulator (allway 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) will bring you MP3 players from the above indicated marks.
The first virtual operator is going to Czech in the aeroplane year.
Perhaps
The mobile market in Czech is directly growing and our operators are practically offering all services as their partners in West Europe.
But we're missing something here -- a virtual operator that you'd need to get up classically.
Maybe there's no longer mistake.
The Chess Operators are the most oldest in Europe, we're on the Mobile.
Recently he confirmed that the CTU, which warned that the SMS price is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the rural regulation policy, it may be possible for the paradox situation - for some Czech mobile operators, the MS will be lower than home.
How can the prices in Czech be maintained in comparison with Europe so high?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to leave to war.
Maybe it seems paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrations higher than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to play that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Agency (CHTU), Paul Dürrique, who had recently expressed that it was not for another operator in Czech.
It's probably true that the classic operator with its own network has no longer been able to have a chance (only, he'd probably have to look hard for a frequency).
But there is another option - virtual operator.
Just entering virtual operators on the mobile market, he brought an explicit reduction of the prices that they had to react and classical operators.
At the same time, before entering the shock, Tスコ Mobile or Virgin Mobile in the market, the voices like us in the Great Britain.
But it was shown that the place for such operators is and they can really be successful.
Last time, we don't need to go too far for examples.
In the aeroplane, we informed you about the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
For the only half of the year, this operator has been able to receive more than 100 thousand customers and to be the five largest operator.
At the end of Mobilking, the Penta Financial Group, which is in Czech Other U:fona.
The achievement of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a larger specific target group.
In order to work effectively, they have a lot of less customers than the classic operator.
They do not have relatively high costs for the construction, driver and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, the virtual operators are usually profiled as low-financial loads - offer living calls and SMS, which are often exported by a useful service.
Thus, Tesco Mobile in the Great Britain has to offer SMS at least half more than his competitor.
However, as the Mobilking example shows in Poland, it may be a very good threat and a rent on the unresolved target group.
This operator is, however, specifically measured by men.
"The right guys call Mobilking - operator who loves them and they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, conducting this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if it's like a concept in Poland could be taken with us.
The print speaker Vodafon Miroslav Czech: "The Czech market is relatively small for segment access on which most of the virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated from the view of the services's menus."
In Czech without chance, they say mobile operators
But it seems to be almost sure that if there's a virtual mobile operator in Czech, it's not Mobilking.
"We talk about the expansion of this successful project, but the actions are not too hopeful.
It's almost going to run the Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in the telephone talk for Mobil.cz Jan Studničk, printing financial group of Penta.
However, she confirmed that the staying mobile operators in Czech are not decisively closed.
Anyway, he's trying to do everything so that no potential concurrent doesn't destroy.
In view of the execution of the virtual mobile operator, there is no longer GTS Novera group, which would like to make another step to become a real competitor of the O2 telephones on the field of business candidates.
"We have great interest in that we can offer our clients not only confident but also mobile telecommunications services.
And that's what before, it's better.
On this option, we have made it again with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to continue in actions, ” says Paul Kaidl’s print speaker group.
So maybe it's a better time.
In non-official information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be expected to be waited for the year's end.
It's easy, but his relationship makes an increasing grass of smoking.
"In this time we don't believe that there is a Chess market space for the impact of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific for other markets.
Forward, there was no subject with a complex and series project in this area," he brought in his explanation for Mobil.cz Customly Mrsschenni from the O2 Printing Affairs.
Other operators are also called to the Czech market specificity.
The T-Mobile Martin Kemr is added to an important agreement with O2: "It's why we have not announced no life-efficient and ambitious commercial project on which it would be possible to continue to establish."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will appear hard to the end of the year.
In this moment, we should have a specific agreement on the table to be able to consider in this short horizon."
Vodafone shall note its attention as far as to fulfil its own 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Cepika says: "We have opened one with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of share of costs and infrastructures.
This is right to think of the spectrum of advocats as the best.
The main Vodafon strategy in this area is to find partners to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible Offices - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can easily understand, the entrance of another operator would mean the increase of competition, leads to the price and also to the pool of their fish.
Why, then, to improve such competitors?
The fact that when the operators are about something, they're going to go through a spectacle, testifying also the taxis around the U:fon.
Maybe the biggest pressure to the CHTU has gone in the time of the U:phone from T-Mobile company.
The public accessible information from the CTU web site.
But now U:fon is just a argument why the virtual operator doesn't allow.
Martin Kemr submitted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been replaced by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator on the market.
With regard to the character of the mobile market in the CRR, it is clear that the entrance of another player would be on him and, in particular, put high requirements on his service."
In accordance with this access to mobile operators, it is directly discharged by the technical regulatory authorities.
However, it is not only about the positions of the CHTU, who were worthy in the Czech - in the differences from the Great Britain and other companies - there is no power to hold into the economic cohesion.
These are exclusively the Agency for the Protection of the Economic Court (UOHS).
But he took his typical position to the whole problem.
"The introduction of the virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the end of the agreement between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the required infrastructure.
No such a contract was closed afterward, because the offer of potential interesters was less interested for classic operators," he reported in response to our question Christian Chalupa from the Auditors of Foreign Relations.
This formed expression may not be surprised from operators.
From the Office to take accounts of consumers and other interests, even in order that nobody uses its position on the market, it is more than the currency.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the border where virtual operators regularly work, we can notice that their input on the market has contributed to reducing prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure of the correct market environment and prices are not compared to the interests of the UOHS.
In fact, in all cases, three mobile operators who are exceeding their reaction.
The question, if it's really about an agreement, it's all offered.
As exactly the same price of benzine in the smooth stations, it is certainly only part of the agreement and the severe competitive war.
"In this case, the Government has not seen the signs of the contrary operation, and therefore it does not have any reason to contain.
No operators have a dominant position, therefore there is no responsibility for its operation on the market.
The needed tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are not less than the telecommunicator's regulator's," introduced in Chalupa’s statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many sport points.
In fact, there is an analysis of relevant markets produced by the CTU, in accordance with telecommunications on the view of the only market.
In this market, therefore, no of the Chess operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts but offer other views - for the effect of the virtual operator is always required the agreement of the network manager.
And the mobile operator - he's totally logically - on his monopol network.
So in a certain segment, it must be dominant.
Even if we wouldn't allow this argument, the UOHS should be at least warning that three mobile operators are immediately likely.
However, a number of interesters (including GTS Novera) show that, when all operators act, the operators are very similar to them.
The review of responsibility to the CTU is then in telecommunications a regular trick that the UOHS provides from the entire interest of the hands.
We met him in several similar cases.
Recently adopted telecommunication law notes were not able to prosecute the enlargement of the CHTU in the Economic Code in telecommunications, as well as the investigators had promised the improvement of the situation.
This must the UOHS leaders know more than well, but, of course, their interests are only.
It's going to happen when nobody looks.
However, without notice, there remains functioning of any psychoviral operators that exist in the Czech mobile networks immediately.
These are companies that provide own prices of mobile services, which are publicly partly.
Normally, it's about a company who's a multilevel marketing.
The own mobile phone services offers Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and the number of others.
The customers of these fires are usually getting only to the elections.
Cousl is expected that the company of the operator is a classic company of SIM Caret.
As a significant reporter, then, the special price (and another) offers will be received.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators are forbidden by a similar transparency.
"If the cases you are talking could be taken on the absence of contracting conditions that we should be occupied and could be discussed at the end of cooperation with the company," answered Martin Kemr.
But it's too impossible that it would not be similar to the responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of three mentioned firms, it can go to thousands of customers.
No operators, however, do not take such a procedure.
In the case of this firm, they have the same unnecessary tissue, and it is, in the differences of real virtual operators - they do not cause their own official marketing.
Myroslav Czechical advertises: "The law allows such speculation, although the services of these firms only uses only the percentage of the customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not led to their name, so they can't be fully available as a mobile operator."
But it should be at least weird.
Moreover, another question for UOHS will be opened.
If the mobile operators do more than the same eye procedure, why are they blocking the relationship of the virtual operator?
It is essential to add that the UOHS has to decline the same activities directly strongly, and if it does not want it, it is not necessary to be satisfied with the clearing of the operators that they don't have any idea and their business conditions are prohibited.
When we're not the oldest
As it has already fallen in the text sometimes, the input of virtual operators on the mobile market has brought a significant price for services.
However, practically in all countries where the virtual operators have grown, the classic operators have tried to protect their relationship more or less.
Jim used arguments were practically true - too small, accidentally too saturated market, problems with quality services etc.
However, in many countries, the regulatory authorities in those moments have not been interested in mobile operators, but their customers.
The first virtual operator has already been made formal measures or non-formal pressure, and it has been achieved.
The Czech regulatory authorities are in the case of a horror brambor.
We can't get out of our experience that the unfaithfulness of the competents is in these cases more than the horses.
But don't let's get a fucking life.
If they are a correct and virtual operator, the Chess mobile market may be replaced again.
If some of the operators have accepted a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS will only be difficult to reject (discrimination) other interests.
And we need to stop calling a stress than in the rest of Europe.
The new chess hymne has four new versions.
Select the best here
Listen to four new versions of the Czech State hymnes.
In the week of the Prime Minister Mire Topolan, in the opportunity of the Day of the Czech State, he made a festival new loads of the State Himney where my house was.
Hymnu newly played the Orchester of the National Divide under the leader of Jiri While.
There are four versions - with a man or a woman’s single song, in the congregation training and instrumental comments.
Catherine of the priest and Adam Plachetka took a song.
The manufacturers are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krčk.
On the iHNed server, you can listen to all four versions.
The beauty is considering a chess national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech speaker has already said that he has chosen directly to sing soil variants with young representative voices that are expressed and favorable.
"On the beginning I was with both, and then the congregation also tried to take a clear dick, so that it would be a text to understand well to conceal," he said.
The Czech State hymne in the next year will celebrate the 175th year.
While my house was first mentioned in 1834 on the front of the Stavov Divadle in the original Chinese game Fidlovacca Josefa Kayetan Tyla completed by the French Schcrop.
She got popularity and people took it spontaneously for their own.
The first phrase was then written after the relationship of the Czech Slovenia in 1918 was a natural part of the state himney.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the exclusive Czech Republic.
How does it mean "new" hymne?
The primary MHD MHD in the middle of the first moves on chip
Meanwhile 1 October 2008, it is writed in the story of the Prash Trade Affairs as a date when to metro, trams and buss are driving first traveling, which will be in place of papir shipping in the box of electronic bus.
This is in this moment a hundred thousand people who have their own opencard card.
The residents may be 30-day and 90-year-year-old coffee (they will be paid from 1 January 2009) and also let them load on their card in info centers and workers of the Trade Company in the state of the Museum, the Mount, the Nadrarje Holešovice, the Angel, the Department, the Lithuania, the Cobylisy, the Rajsy Garden, Kačrov and Luka.
Buys can also buy through the Internet from yesterday on www.dpp.cz websites.
The service was used over four hundred advocates for the afternoon.
Those who begin to use the Internet business can definitely forget the outside window in the stage meters where they still have to be regularly in long fronts on the paper officers.
Kupons buy through the Internet and on the Opencard map, they buy it in one of the thirty-shirts of the City Library.
"In these places, there is a traveling review with a pro-counting service that will help the interesters to buy the Internet and also replace their buying card," said Martin Opatrny project.
The book will also be able to load the electronic buys on Opencard in self-observed cars that are shown in several meters.
How's the car looking like?
They are red, they remind the hairmarks of the league, and they may have already seen them in the states of the Department, Budajovick, I. P. Paula, Florenc and Vtavsk.
"They are in the town five, but at the end of the year they should be eighth," added Optical.
Bupon checks instead of driving
It's simply easy for the cars that start to work tomorrow.
It's enough to move the opencard card to them, and the first payment is replaced on it.
Electronic compounds pay not only in the main city, but also in its area.
Then in the fields and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which go to the main city of the central citizens.
"In the boxes attached to Prash integrated transports are originally packed by the readers of the cart, with which they discover the time and the passenger validity of the compounds," explained the control of the chief Philip Drapal from the Ropid organization, which builds a road line of traveling.
Home buses are reading carts built in the base at the manager.
Therefore, it is necessary not only to show the drivers, but also needs to add Opencard to a specific location on the board side.
That's how the director controls the validity of the compounds replaced.
"If you need to check the validity of the replaced compounds, there is nothing easier than requesting the manager of this information," added Drapal.
Restaurants who are not busy buses and don't remember when they finish the validity of the bus, they can repeat to self-served cars where the buses are loaded on the card.
There will be information about the validity of their evidence shown on the disposal of the device.
Sudety wanted the United States reference.
The Sudan Germans in 1945 requested Shumavia to the United States.
It is a letter that is stored in the Southern Scientific Library collections.
If we can't be part of German or Rakous, we want to live at least under the American patron.
In 1945, there were a number of Sudan German groups in 1945 to President of the United States.
It is referred to in other letters that were stored in a private archive, and today it is stored in the assemblies of the Southern Scientific Library.
Germans from the Czech Krumlova are requested in a letter of the President of the United States to not allow the return of the "Shumaw Shuma" - held by Hitler on the basis of the Mine-Agreement - return to the Slovakia.
"We have understanded the right situation and we really want to be sure the words that American units are coming in the German territory, not as an enemy, but as a liberator," wrote in the letter, signed by the word "Americans who are lying on the heart."
Since the connection to the Sweden Germany is given to the Sweden - when the Czech National Consciences knows - hopes only for brutality, invisibility, incompatibility, disaster and slavery, ask the cars of the American President to transform the protector over Shuma for the present and everlasting time.
"We can't believe that you're not in view of four million citizens have accepted this country to a stranger who smokes and brings out smaller and nothing, it has never been able to win the United States," wrote in the letter.
The reason why cars can't sign, it's very concerned with the "Chee's strugglers."
If the President of the United States would be aware of the Shuman Germany's thoughts, it would be sufficient to order a reference in Shumania on whether her residents want to be part of the United States or live under the patron of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can be considered a little strictly, according to some memories, in the future, the expectation of the Sudan Germany is in accordance with.
Although the Germans had to mind at least that they would take care of their relationships from the Republic, only few of them have forgotten the same possibility.
Some were expected that the United States and the United Kingdom had a certain type of autonomy to the Sudat.
Others believed that they just stayed in the Slovakia.
It also confirms the glorious rakian newspaper Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Buddhists.
He was for a war as a Buddhist Germany attached to the sea on Balt.
When the British had taken him at the end of the war, and put him into the prison camp in Holland, ten other German Germans followed him to teach them to the Chinese.
"They believe that when they come home, they're gonna go to them a party," said Chalupa.
No of the German prisoners who live before the war in the Slovakia, according to him, didn't count on the basis of Benesh's decrees to be raised from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign involving managers
The most important actions are intended to safeguard in the Czech history.
It would also be to be characterised by the emotional medical campaign, which is in the middle of the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of the Ministry Aleshe the Great Promises from her that he rejects the leader from the dangerous behavior of the caller.
The campaign for 150 million is shown in TV, radio, kine, on the internet, but also on airports.
She should be driving from the fast cars and alcohol after the caller.
And to remind them that they should be remembered before they go out.
In conscience, he wants to take up the most young leaders, engineers, travelers, and in the last order also professional managers.
What's going on in sometimes?
The mainly human story that affects emotions.
And about that, and the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "You don't think" is written by large letters on the speech.
And there's the word "speaking."
This must symbolize that a person can pay his own life for a minute of insight.
The strangers will be "thinking" until 2010.
The Ministry has not been inspired by low campaigns in English countries where you can regularly see images with drastical images of the victim of a disease.
He promises that it reduces the disease and the number of dead in the Czech Mountains.
The Euro RSCG Agency prepared.
Cukr and steel on managers
"To the driver pays the sugar and smoking system.
The sugar for them is that, for example, when they're going to the Red, they'll take time.
The battle is a threat of trials or accidents.
Leaders must be risked," says the carrier psychologist at Homolce Martin Korzán.
It is therefore necessary for information campaign in the pressure and mainly negative reklame, less psychologist.
It's less efficient according to the table that advertises the managers of danger.
"When a statistical table is installed before danger, it may probably be driving with the circuits and the leaders will not take it up," advised the Corean.
Olmert would return at least all the occupied areas of peace
The President of the provisional Israel government, Eud Olmert, was urged to return practically all the fields occupied in 1967, thus also the Forward Jordan, the East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, with Palestinian and Syria.
He did so in the conversation that on Monday recorded Jediot Achronot.
"We have to go back to the agreement with Palestinian, which means that it will be necessary to return at least all (offered) fields, if not exactly everything," said Olmert.
"We're sure the percentage of these fields, but to Palestinians we'll have to take the same percentage (in Israel) because it's not worthless of it," added.
He allowed the eventually returned to the East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want to move his tractors or buldozers, as it has been agreed to one of my best friends, it will be necessary to give a part of Jerusalem," recognised Olmert in the ransom on two Red attacks in the city where some people were killed and ten persons were destroyed.
According to the Premier, "Special solution for the temple mountain, holy and historical places", which is inside the old city.
"Whoever will want to keep Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It's not going to work," he's looking forward.
Department of the Golan High
Olmert also announced Israel from the Golan Highs, which is an increasing condition to conclude the peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also need certain efforts from Damash.
"I'm not supposed to close the peace of Siria only on the basis of Golan's department," advised.
"The Sergents know what they're going to get Golan.
They will have to give their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give their relationship to Hizballah; they will have to provide permanent support offered to the terrorism (Spain) Hammas, Al-Kajdy and Jihad (Space Wars)," exclaimed the pressor.
Questions after the accident: Are there stewards in the bus?
The law is unknown, it's not possible to walk in the remote bus.
In relation to the tragic bus of the Student Agency, a question of the Italian Pado, whether stewards and traveling vehicles can be moved after the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally maintain the law, it is the act of staff in relationship with the law on the powerful rule," says Karel Hanzelk's Minister's transport.
The accident in which the past week has lost a 20-year steward, of course has made the manager of the rent car that crashed the bus.
The girl was sitting near the manager, at least a safe place in the car, although she was cut out two other places.
However, the bus can be able to steward, or to be cut off, even in the moment when steward increases the coffee or news.
The role plays whether the bus has been bused according to the technical test.
If it's not homologated in the bus, it's necessary to sit a walking seat.
Down Buss Student Agencies have no locations for training; what is currently. It confirmed also the director of Radim Janczura.
"This is what we decided with the Ministry, and the first movement of the travelers has not allowed.
Afterward, we have called it, and we have achieved that the travellers are able to walk for the toalet if they have their seat," he shared his opinion.
The law does not know the law
"It does not exist a unique legal exemption of the role of steward - no legal rules of this role will be resolved.
However, there is no legal legislation nor allows the supplier to provide services.
The law on motor treatment knows only the terms of the driving vehicle; it does not define the right and responsibility," adds less a single speaker Hanzelk.
The Executive Director of the Foreign Force Force of the Ministry of Transport of Josef Recourse is, in addition, that the law's problem is sufficiently monitored.
"It's what if you have a bus in the homologation, you're allowed to stay.
That's the end, he says.
Autobuses share in the city where they are located at the field and limited maximum speed, interemployed with locations to stay with highly allowed speed and on remote spaces with the highest allowed speed and seats saved safe fields.
As in the aircraft, the expert says
Expert BESIP for transport safety Jaroslav Hohrin in the movement of stewards on the bus board does not see the basic problem.
"In the aircraft of a lot of dangers, the situation will be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Not here, it's not sure when the turbulency comes and the aircraft can go into the head."
"If the bus would be cut off, of course he will pay physical laws.
Like in the town bus or tramway.
The safety of stavards must resolve the transport of internal rules," says, and in the case of the law, it is unresolved.
Annulation of services is attempted to cancel
Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus transporter.
He's working for two hundreds.
The Director doesn't consider their call as risk.
"If I'm going to find that it's calling risk stewards, so I cancel them.
Coffee and news can be able to get a traveling.
It's gonna be a lot of costs," says he.
As a interest in security, the absence of stavards in his cars, director Alexandre Litvin, who carried out lines in comparison with SA.
"We don't have stories, we're standing up from the beginning.
Before or later, it's gonna end some dead crazy," he said for a real year for Tyden.cz.
It's been an increasing tragedie.
In the accident of the link connection to Neapole, a young steward from Plzeňska, who worked two years for the company.
The Slovakian stone probably chosen without use of directs from the steel and locked the bus path.
His leader tried to get out of the courageous man, however, he struck about him the right part of the front.
That it would be sold two places to be sold for the staff's relationship, Janczura refuses.
"This place is not possible to reserve in remote connections, it is blocked."
The company's going to urge a stone driver.
With the disappointment of the girl's family, the Agency won't wait for the court's office, but the financial replacement expects also from the victory side.
Replacement of law?
Invisible
The exemption of the movement of stewards on the bus should bring the correction of the law in which the thirty-year-year-old employment group of transport ministers.
"No specific conclusion, however, didn't happen.
Autobuses nor are too different, like point system, maximum speed at the bottom and the use of the mobile at the management," says the expert Horian.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards as a fundamental way to enhance the safety of traveling," states Hanzelk with that the control of bus safety is in the policy and security offices.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The major words in the letter of the representation of WestLB's employees of this bank are missing.
The Union of this disseldorf money institution with France Deka-Bank will refer to "the Central Financial Group's Affairs on capital markets," we read in the letter that has received publicity in the lunch.
WestLB in accordance with the letter to this transaction will enter a "competition sad" ensuring the long-term expenditure.
And in general, such connections may be a decision-making impulse to further grouping in the sector of the country banks.
Such texts include when you want to demonstrate the capacity to act in the problem period.
The unstabil WestLB is still under a significant pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Community Agency for the monitoring of financial services, which has been informed by the country government in the North-Vestfolk that it is time to find a solution for future.
On the connection between Deka-Bank, which the customers know for her investment funds, and WestLB, if any kind of type, they speak longer - and on the French side.
Boss Deka-Bank Franz Waas, in the presentation of half-year economy results at the end of August, sent to hear that in the foot of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with some of the country banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, does not see sense.
The Administrative Council of Deka-Bank, for which one of the half of the country banks and the other swines were joined, yet he confirmed the representation of the proposal of discussions with WestLB on Community trade activities.
It may be here about trades on the capital market or part of them.
However, the discussions have started, and the financials are involved.
The Deka-Bank, which is with its 3000 employees, is the most important employees on the financial market in Frankfurt, will not first speak in accordance with consolidation in the cooperative sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it could be able to go to the Deka-Bank foot with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank.
There was nothing in this third place.
A short time after the plans of fuel were made publicly, the Hessenian country government was proclaimed against the participation of the Helaba bank.
Not both of the rest of bank houses have been connected so.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
However, the specialization of the Deka-Bank's connection with the land banks was recognized again.
However, in recent time, the specialization of his financial house with others was negatively expressed by the President of the Presidency of the Helaba Bank.
However, it seems that independently to be convinced that the approach of various bank houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the choices to the land dream in Bavorsca, it could be started to start connecting BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not just a good news for Helabu.
If the pressure should be increased to another fuzzy, it comes progressively on the possible partners for such connections.
On the south, it would only play the second chair, although the financial crisis is excited as much better than the bank houses in Mnich and Stuttgart.
The proposal with WestLB in the beginning of the year, Svaz made the Swiss bondage and eggs of Hessen-Thüringen, which has a fifty-fourth percentage in Helabia.
It would look like the north LB.
Geostrategic impacts of this type are only one side of problems.
On the other hand, the question is how much the business models of individual institutions are together.
In June, Merl announced that the decision-making question should be ensuring the future competitive capacity of the country bank, the German bonds were confronted and not responded later.
Everything could also end the WestLB's distribution that, of course, nobody's in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the representation, it is also talking about the "complex solution" for the entire bank house.
Whether and how to connect to a single folder with Deka-Bank will show time.
The second week of October is known as "weeking with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luca's third or number.
But this time, Elena will be as his friend, and so it's gonna be all different, he says.
Following them, at the 5-literary court of Kaiser's mark, they stand stronger shipping and two tourists in October shows how deep tones can be able to give his herd.
Elena Luca's first smoking and then loves him.
They came from Bolon to Verona.
From here, from the bus parks by Puortta New, this evening will come out on 23.45, four buses with the "Destination Monaco, the party of the Birra", preliminary accommodation 6.30.
Three buses contain in particular Italians, in one bus they go exclusively Brazilians.
In one side of the parks, these South Americans have already been singing with their hair, they have already been celebrated in the night.
And that's what you're saying, "Marcoguard, it's nothing for Italy.
Marco, who has a long coffee with a broad coffee of the likely steel, and with large silver cuts, these three buses are looking for.
Five years with them go to Octoberfest, only in the air year, three trips are ordered.
In the night there, on the day between the shops and the pive, on 22.30, go back.
The translation would be just a lot of costs, says Marco.
The path is 75 euros, including the income of Pive Kaiser, which was expressed exactly in accordance with the Bavor law on the cleaning of drinks, health insurance and German speaker - Marco walked in Frankfurt in a language course.
The buss are out in the night, after the driving direction to Brenner.
The pivo isn't going, yet not.
The bus is quickly slow, walking sleep.
They're good, they'll still need their powers.
It's located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it's on the remote room of 8 rows before Mnichovem makes another break and many other buses with an Italian recognition mark.
When the Marco group finally comes on the parking at the seventh morning from Theresienwiss, there are almost 50 other buses from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathered, Marco has the last demonstration, explains the plan of attack.
First: Set a yellow head.
It is on the left swap, written "Octoberfest", near the Internet address of Marco's travel office: "concersivising.it".
The second, "When the doors are opened to the beast, let's run!" He called Marco to the morning air.
"Go!" Go and sit in the back side of the state.
"Don't be forward to tell you, and not all yellow hairs on the same lavage, you'll be moved after the space."
There's 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the property.
"Security shows us that we're stealing.
When you leave your places, they are gone."
Third, "You'll be here in half the eleventh evening." You understand?
And I'm upstairs on Wesn, space with drinking states.
One member of the group brings yellow heads as labels on trees, cedals and even to choice a large bavory side.
It's gonna be prepared for the output.
As "weeking with Italy" is known for the second week of Octoberfest.
The total data on the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about fifty thousand people who are traveling through Alpy and entering drink states, the ten percent of all visitors this week has gone out of Italy.
The mission policy sends seven cops from South Tyrol, Italian guests support Bavor's Red Cross, which leads national statistics, in which Italian before the British (cause 60 cases) and Rakushany (cca 80) with approximately 200 medical investigations contain the first place.
It's especially favorable in the Italian state of Hofbre.
Nothing night for Hypo Real State
In the past week, Peer Steinbrück, a socio-financial Ministry declared that the German bank system is relatively stabil.
Finally, this policy used the word "relatively" and in its statement it also entered into the fact that the German bank sector would not remain a crisis development.
Because this was on the last week.
The Index of Dax monitored financial houses specialised to finance Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is received from the consortion of German banks of credit in a number of billion for protection against turbulences on the markets.
The person noted at the Sunday situation said Agent Reuters that the credit aid would go up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only be paid from the real detailed parts.
The money goes from private and public banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughters are lost.
This State financer is based on the news reports on long-term projects on which the money was able to re-financing extremely shortly, which now is not possible because of unbelieving markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reserve was 95 per cent to 2,37 million euros and also reduced the share of its own capital from 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
Regular expenditure and pure costs from financial trade reaching the past year were rent on zero, expenditure from higher value of reviews and of certain price papers, and also from a reserve for credit trade reserves of more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only the higher costs of the next calculation costs in the restructuring of the old Depfa group and the replacement of the measures in accordance with the payment and the consumption of the trade for concert undertakings were still dead.
The last State Financier, after his privatization in 1990, branched on the hypotheses for foodstuffs, which were then made out of the Portfolio and led Aareal Bank.
Because in the classic state financing was too few, Depfa was then stronger in infrastructure projects and in financing common projects of private investors and State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP), and internationally differences.
From the values of his daughter company, Hypo Real Estate must now receive something, and these receipts will have a "the basic mental effect" for the calculation of the gas and the loss of the whole group, as some have not heard incertainly.
In fact, the division isn't.
Two thirds have been disappointed for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate is from the prevention of Depfa’s significant financial projects of State and Infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions to re-financing the interbank market because there is no contributions to customers.
After the end of the American investment banks Lehman Brothers was practically exhausted between bank credits, because the banks had a liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for the Depfa portfolio part of the Depfa - £ 50 billion euro - short-coding media for refinancing.
According to the report of Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of this group is to be covered at a period of time, and the company is protected "for the impact of international money markets at the moment in significant measures of uncomprehensive functions".
Other sources were not allowed to hear that this money was ensuring refunding until the end of 2009.
The Presidency of HRE Georg Funke reported once that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not use money markets in the respective period.
The Community Bank and the Community Agreement for Financial Services (BaFin) prevent that the competitive capacity of the Hypo Real State on the market is now ensuring.
Actioners and crediters of the banks are trusted in this.
But with regard to the dynamic and incompatibility of crisis, it is probably not sure.
It's not even excited that the trust shouldn't be completely cut off.
However, it cannot be excluded.
After the bank on week after the week afternoon, after all insolvency, he can't be able to save your peace.
The shortage of activity has fallen 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
Finally, it was good to keep the debts.
While preventive duties were not practically rejected, they lose the duties of other obligations more explicitly.
This is particularly the obligation of the old girlfriend Württemberg Hypo and logical obligations for the period of implementation after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate's reliability appeared originally as an alternative investment opportunity for speciality, but their stability is required after explicitly restricted bank crisis and the crisis of a single institution who carried it into the company in the Depfa, to understand in accordance with the stability of the international financial system.
While emergency banks, governments and less employed trade banks will be able to support the system, it is possible to calculate the victims of price papers in their long-term employment.
However, it may also be possible to do that in the present case, if no one does not expect hope - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be persuaded.
However, in view of the reports present with this party exempt, the probability of restrictions with certainty has now been able to use a correct hope.
This is especially for long-term creditors, most likely to prepare a number of successful nights when they will decide whether their obligations will be given.
Currently, investors may use a limited number to create the transfer of losses from the previous account periods to the short costs of recent years for future payments from capital costs.
Sylvan and the secret of the bent
When Sylvan Hiltropo's sixty-year-old day on the middle school in Tachikban, girls will begin to smoking: This Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana's the word already knows from mang, and in his new blog about the remote residence of Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been able to go out of the way to school.
I live in the Tokia country on the Cawasaki country, and I'm leaving 40 minutes in the middle of Taiwan.
I had to find the way alone. I hadn't lost it.
It seems that the beginning of the exemptions in Tajiban is not given as exact as we're home in the Down Sask.
Students begin to sit after eight hours and twenty minutes before nine begins a short meeting with a teacher, e.g. 'home room'.
But yet before I started learning, I had to imagine.
But I'm not the type of person who likes to speak before people, so before the class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I took the old suck of my hostial mother, to the blue, blue underscore, and the black cow bottles.
So I standed before the lavage and tried to say all right, "Sajoneara Wo sex Sylvan..." - I'm called Sylvan, I'm going from Germany, and for a week I'm birthday.
At that time, I was very happy that I started learning tongue two years ago.
All 31 holes in the class shocked, kicked and had, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I've already known this from my man.
It is the basic vocabulary of the Japanese girls needed to survive and means 'whow, sweet'.
Then I fell on my place fast.
A girl near me was a lot of honour, thinking that she had to sit with her at the border student.
The rest of the hours was very quiet, but when he was called a gong, he's got a lot to sleep me.
They talked to one another and chichotaly and asked me about the possible and impossible -- and then it is serious to understand Japanese English.
Then they're all cut off their bents.
My hospital mother also made me such a cocktail for lunch - and it's something else than a noise of German feasts.
I had fish with branches, little pieces, salt from the eye and the hair, the fruits and the coats of fish in the woods.
Most of me don't know what exactly here in Japan.
These things look specially, and they're busy a lot of new.
Of course it's that everything's really good.
Well, maybe on the sun, br!
The japanese schools are not only food.
Sometimes, the girl gives the child self-handed bent, which is in this case, especially manufactured, and hopes that the boy is nearly known.
I read it in my comic books.
I'm sure if I'll see it here too.
'Why are the Japanese?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to the school in Tokyo.
And I always said,
'Cause he just fascinates me.'
The ends of the years are the most pleasant reading of man.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning a little little Japanese.
So I was very clear that I'd have to come here once.
Because I've also got a weakness for tradition, usual and normal.
And you're high price here.
On the other hand, Japan's countries are the most recent technologies and trends, and the other is basic, discipled and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even when Tokio is the greatest city I've ever seen."
And the crises have feelings
When the crises or the shoes flee from danger, does it mean that they also hurt fear?
The neurolog Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to confirm whether they suffer the same when they keep like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published a few years ago.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series represents the selected answers to the question "What are you thinking of true, and do not prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of knowledge, and I don't have any other reason to prove if we can't prove that they have other people.
But in this case, we can at least hope because all human brains have appropriate basic configuration.
However, when we begin to take another kind and open the questions of exploitation or fully knowledge, we go into a southern territory because the hardware doesn't agree.
When the crisis gets in danger, it will do the same thing that many other animals do: it will imagine that they are dead, shoot or shoot.
People are likely, from which some scientists use a comparable substance consumption.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structures need to improve the transfer of our subjective consumption to consumption of animals.
However, it is because the markets associated with human knowledge almost always include the prefrontal shortex (for its share in short-coding memory and implementation or functions).
This extensive area is in humans explicitly developed than in other primates, and it seems that there is a entire failure in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our knowledge, which affects the prefrontal shortex, among them science who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that a person is even different from other principles.
Another dramatic speciality may hide the language basic of a person: because it is such a large part of his interpretation is connected to the language, it is often telling that he knows that it is involved.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if he doesn't depend on the language, the language would have influenced him, so the animal knows it already built anyway, it might be different from the most of our knowledge.
That is why it is difficult to detect how it seems to be knowledge of other animals.
When, as an internal and subjective thing, does not measure nor, because of the special hardware, analysis on the basis of our own experience, he makes us his investigation before great problems.
Most of my executions are related to the contents of knowledge, but there are further aspects of knowledge that should be scientifically accessible.
There would be possible processes in knowledge to examine animals without regarding their contents, and exactly it happens in the studies of short-coding memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this access to Christof Koch and Francis Crick is at least focused on neural corelets of knowledge than on the commercial mechanisms: both can be identical, but they also do not need.
It is interesting that this access also shows the significance of the non-frontal shortexe for visualization.
What's going on for feeling?
I bring them out of that emotically, as it is the system of fear, is active in the brain of knowledge of its own activities.
What we mean as "strach" is then a mental state in which we are located when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences as the body reactions) uses the operational memory.
As seen from this point, the feelings of courage are conducted with the shortex areas that are determined primically, and especially people.
In connection with the language nature, it reduces a lower disagreement, because by means of words and graphics, we can distinguish and category states to write them near ourselves and others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings of the primitive activities in the cortex and the brain milks of carbons, such as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain rounds.
Since this network has not changed too much in human evolution, it could be quietly shared on the feelings of more animal families.
Clearly, I can't repeat it, but I think it's not proveable.
Pankseep arguments that what we're in the cry and people are as fear, they're probably both organs like that: How is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether crises and people so much as they do?
Swab for the danger of the wrath - is he too afraid?
From my view, it can not be able to use the likeness of behavior to prove the compliance of consumption.
It's true that neural comparison is raising us further: crises and people have similar brass, against it, or the brass.
But is it a responsible brain?
And even if it was possible to show it to a man, how would we want to show it in the cup?
I think the crises and the other saviors, maybe even the swabi (who knows?), have their feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are likely distinguished from our people (for human knowledge is involved in special and languages), I study more emotional behavior than the emotional use of crisis.
In this case, we can wait for the progress on the neural level if we are at the cross and in the people.
As I don't study language and knowledge, I don't understand nor feel, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to be a short-screen, but I'm happy to go forward than I'll turn back against the wall.
I'm practically emotional.
President of the EUFA Platini: The time of mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Press Ivan Vasjunik said that the preparations will soon lead to the President and the President.
"The Government sees the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its capacity to coordinate the ME with Poland," said Vasjungnik.
"For our land, it's not an amnestie.
The job has started first, and in both countries it's a lot of things to do."
In the timely fulfillment of the time plan of station, streets, hotels and aircraft, both hostiators are involving.
It is even possible that the number of ME stations reduces the eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We have to work now quickly," said the President of the Ukraine's Majesty Grigory Surkis.
"EUFA will continue to follow us."
Another radial step was condemned in Poland.
The PZPN leadership was revoked by the National Olympic Committee after reading scenarios and replaced the independent manager Robert Zawlockim.
The Committee has received a request for the Ministry of Miroslava Treasury.
There is “the dangers of the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” said the Drewik Poland Printer Agency PAP.
"The President of the EUFA Michela Platini, we confirmed that this step would not be prepared for the ME 2012."
Some teams from the first line were just in the last section of the manipulation was sent down to the nugged meeting, finally they had to even be moved quickly to the beginning of the lig.
Constructed Dennis Quaid returned board
She wanted to make a new movie reklame, talking about private things - and now he has problems with her ex: Hollywoods star Meg Ryan talked about her old Dennisi Quaido as a marrier.
The smoke and turns back.
The remaining war grows in the old couple of Meg Ryan and Dennise Quaid: seven years after development together these two hollywood herbs lead a bad sport - before public views.
Meg Ryan was talking for the American magazine InStyle last week first expressed the reasons for the fault of his marriage: "Dennis was a long time incredible, and it was very painful."
She learned about the ground of the ground until after the divorce.
Instead of this mental striptist was Ryan's work for her new film "The Women" - the story of the developing marriage.
Reaction Dennise Quaida on his presentation as an unbelieving husband was expressed: "It's crazy," said the fourty-year-year-old herec of the New York Daily News, that "Meg's again override the history of our relationship and edits it."
Furthermore, it is "political" that the sixty-year-year-old son of Jack's age again "a publicly reminds the pain and radically changes that are for each child of development."
While Ryan lives from divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became a father to double.
His thoughts about disobedience ends: "My life goes forever.

In the first half of 2008, there were years and lives in Europe better than in the previous year.
In Germany, there were years in accordance with one current study even more leather than 50 per cent.
Years and inhabitants in hotels released - this is the result of the traveling and financial services of American Express.
The company analysed its data on the first half of 2008 reserves, and after the price increased in the first quarter, their expression in the second quarter.
After a few years of prices on the hotel market, the residence on many places has already been laid down.
From January to March, the price increased in 41 of 48 European cities in average of 6,9 % in comparison with 2007.
However, since April to June, the prices were low to 3,6 per cent than in the previous year.
The most comparable trend was in Paris and Roman, where the travelers had to pay about 30 to 37 percent less than in the past year.
For the cause of this trend, American Express considers a lot of dollar curse, which has committed "the low-friend American tourists to travel."
In addition, the hotel prices were also stronger in the financial centre than the industrial centre, such as Hannover, Colin over Ryn or Stavanger.
In this northern city, the price of hotels has increased 26,3 per cent of the European record.
The prices also showed in the first quarter of the airport:
Because of cherosin disorders in the Economy class had to pay in average 7,1 per cent more than in 2007, at the age of remote years, even to 29,2 per cent had been healthy.
Since April to June to June, the aeroplane prices in the Economy class on average 12,5 per cent in comparison with the previous quartal, but in Business and First-Class class changes were less expressed.
In Germany, the prices were more expressed than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 per cent was grown, in the second quarter of 23.6 per cent.
In German national years, according to the citated studies, the prices even half prices.
One of the reasons for this price fall is reducing economic growth, explains the company.
In many segments of the market with the airport is not achieved.
On the other hand, there is because of the Agreement of Open Skies, which released a aircraft between the United States and Europe, higher competitive pressure.
The signed situation is the elimination of non-exhaustive air transport lines, and also the high number of aircraft companies that were reported in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were 24 aeroplanes.

The dark temperature affects the years of universe sonds
For years, scientists don't know the advice with one of the judicial phenomenon: the dark temperature affects the speed of universal sands during the manevru swing-by (gravitational plot).
Experts are afraid that the general relationship theory Albert Einstein would not have to be fully correct.
At least 18 years, the Ulysses universe was flying.
The wine of palve guidances that will soon be locked, now the worst death will smile.
In the middle of the scientists, a famous phenomenon makes smooth - anomalies of a gravitational smoke.
Gravitative plot is an aeroplane of universe solds, where they get additional hybrid in a gravitative field of some universe body, such as the Earth.
Thanks to the samples, they can explore a lot of balls.
The European American research sonda Casini-Huygens used this physical trick like the sunsond of Ulysses.
But what the scientists have been introduced for years in this case in the meaning: flying bodies are not gradually maintained as a person expected by the old gravity law.
It's also injustice in speed.
Sounds are unexpectedly exceedingly quickly or disappointed.
Before physicians, this effect was not possible to explain.
They baptized him by an anomaly of a gravity.
Some experts are afraid that even the general relationship theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the accessibility of the plants of the space, should not be fully correct.
The American physical Stephen Adler from Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein has not been, and is trying to analyze the gravitational rate to explain through such dark temperatures which the presentness of the world has found astronomic.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be a dark temperature that could also sit close to the earth," wrote.
The existence of dark flowers know the universe researchers at least ten years.
It is obviously a gravitative force that can observe the effects on another universe body.
She's a very invisible, which means that she doesn't send any electromagnetic measures, just even the visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the good fifth of the whole universe mass is of this dark temperature.

New research of American lawyers
The United States Main Administrator named a special officer to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
Tah has come in the situation when the report on the Amery has criticized the activities of government officers by the supervised inspector of the Ministry of Justice.
The report criticized the officers of the White House, the lawyer and the old Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was highlighted by fear that the lawyers were removed from political reasons.
The Special Affairs of Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers were able to hear the audience during the investigators with the purpose of achievement of justice.
General inspector Glenn Fine reported: "The serious challenges including potential crime action was not completely detected or explained."
The name of the special officer with the authority to require witnesses was one of his key recommendations.
The Sport started when the United States Ministry of Justice delivered nine American lawyers in procent 2006 their functions.
Then the Ministry declared that the lawyers were released because of severe exemptions.
However, later, it was shown that the lawyers were not determined about nothing more than many of their colleagues, which many observators had made to conclude that the permission was made politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers have been introduced in the extent of highly established republic messengers and senators, others refused to investigate the offence of the claiming of the elections taken against the Democratics.
American lawyers are investigating and leading prisons in court cases for government.
However, they cannot be removed from political reasons.

Meat Loafo's holiday will be evaluated
Rock stars Meat Loaf gets one of the prices Q Awards for its epic hymn Bat Out of Hell.
The song that comes to the ceremonial of the next week in London for his special gold price, he said he was "forward" recognition.
The letter, which remains nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit alba from 1977.
The nomination of the air year leads the Coldplay group, which has received a broad choice in four categories.
Paul Rees, the main editor of the Magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that stand on such things as time and room, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The writer, written by Jim Steinman, needed great calls that gave Meat Loaf.
She started the instrumental party that was almost two minutes.
The letter was published in the United Kingdom in 1979 as a single, and the highest came to the 15th place.
But Meat Loafo's album Bat Out Of Hell stood around nine years and sold it over 40 million copys throughout the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name of Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in the last years, and in 2003 he was also operated because of the wrong heart rit after he was colocated.
In 2007, the actor laringitid had to interrupt concerts.

Dark streets, often forgotten and quickly for sale
New York City has thousands of motors, streets, farmers and other local communications, some honourable, other useful.
But too many veteranians and long-term locals have difficulty when they have to find extra Place, most of them have never heard about it.
This little street is in the fourth East Village and leads north from the first street - not getting on the second street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At the length of at least 10 and 40 meters of breeding, it takes nearly recognised the restricted transition than the transport torch.
There's no cable names of the street.
In a regular atlas is practically invisible.
However, he has the street of the spectacular.
For example, Avalon Bay, recently established Luxembourgs on the first street.
Extra Place wants to explore and create a clean train to trade and buckets that have to open in new buildings.
Other spectaculars are a long-term neighbors who say that they were cut off the straight street just because it was one of the last remains since the block was cut off.
However, the citizen Agency for Protection and Development of Development, which has the streets in his power, does not have the less interest to keep it.
At the meeting of the agricultural committee of the public community, the citizens and Avalon Bay's plans have been able to buy the road developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the Executive Manager of the Community 3, the Committee approves the variation of the streets remaining in the city and requested a new plan that should be given for the next month.
"The city has already been very little grounds, and we would like extra Place to stay in his property," she said.
"It could be given proposals for the transport and management that could do Avalon, but we also want to deal with public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to explore a small street newly and attend locations to the meeting, some of which would use a camera that would expect to be interested in the property of the developer space.
The thought that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published on the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, he doesn't want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to build this lost street and to make her a beautiful place for publicity," she said and added to selling the city.
Seth Donlin, the Agency for Conservation, said that the city was to sell the streets, and he understood that the task of his office was a majority often developing than managing.
In comparison with his highest seed, Bowery, Extra Place left in the history a lot of steps.
Some people think that the street has received their name in 182 when the great pharma Philip Minthorna was divided between some of his children and there was no one in the field of the country.
To Extra Place, the CBGB door, the Puncrock Memory that was closed in 2006, and the street may be the most known as the Background photos of the Ramones Group "Rocket is Russia".
"This place was wonderful," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who made a picture in November 1976.
"They were full of disappearances, broken clothes and barls, plots, lists, and pizzas."
Some local, including bloggers who are writeing about the smoking of the East Village fourth, stand against the thought to sell extra Place and say that he's a bunch of public room, would have to stay publicly.
Others consider extra Place for a ratio - at least unchanged town box that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who wrote a blog in the name of Jeremiah's inhabitant New York (in the title "The Book of Nearbys: the town of the city in the migration process"), explained a part of the story about extra Place from the manuscript About the city, which was found in the New Yorker newspapers in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a white street, dark, even in the day and increasing reserves of yellow resources and locked windows where a week of old news are broken in the streets."
It looked like a couple of exemptions of the street of one last evening totally the same.
The crisis has passed through the blind end of the street near the door that they have ever brought to CBGB, where they have been busy with a sweet clothing.
There was graffiti, and at the low doses of the news led an empty tissue from the drink.
A couple of colleagues said that at the extra Place sometimes, but he suggested that he could have got some excuse.
Instead, Fields said that some people think that they appreciate the performance of the streets in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in dark, humble and rebellious places."
Debates of Bilingwalt: Insights to English
In this education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Iszumi will discuss the positions of candidates to billing education.
Lance T. Iszumi, academic employer of californists and director of education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a copy of the book "More than you think: why the central class needs to choose schools."
Effectively fulfill the Spanish volcator is an increasing case.
Baracka Obama's training agenda just proves it.
The campaign of the campaign says that "Afro American and Spanish students have a lower probability that they get better than white requests," which is true.
In order to fight with such executive divisions, Obamo's education agenda, especially, in addition to others, "provided bilateral education" for those who learn in English now.
The question of Barack Obam, however, remains if his commitment to the billing education that is impressed to use languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing exercise differences.
We'll take the Sixth Street Prep, a charter-based school at the east period of Los Angeles.
The teachers of these schools are just in most cases of the Spanish families.
More than the third students from which many recently came, English teaches first.
However, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, the highest incredible level of 100 per cent of fourth class requests has been reached.
At the same time, 193 percent of fourth class requests have been achieved at the highest level of state tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by another method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and execution, unfortunateness of capacity and access without explanation.
Next, and Obama should note that, according to Lindy Mikels, directors of Sixth Street, a pedagogical access for those who first teach English, "full advice".
The initiation to English indicates at least the primary use of English in education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is against the billing education, said, "We had a great success with one full of the new mexican chair - you would have entered into the class for twelve months and didn't know who it is."
"It works," she said, "It works for us."
Would Obama take the school as Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should they look like more schools with great Spanish and English teachings?
The results of the school should be responsible for this question, however, the training scheme of its own parties (National Training Association is a long-term staying in two-year-old education) and its own competitive support of two-year-old training is not exceeding the proposal of the Agreement.
While Obama agrees that the advisers should teach English, he recently trivialised when he told people to stop concerns with the "the only English" laws.
Instead of that, "You should ensure your children to speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama actually wants to delete the economic differences, he should almost take care of education models that work, thinking carefully before they are excited and trivialised.
Renewed economic renews
The prices of the eggs in the Sunday for me are afraid that neither the American financial market plan would have to survive.
The prices of restricted trades with ropes in the morning trade in the New York Communication Square to 7 per cent to 99.80 dollars for the barl.
Since the last month, the price of the price was smoothed over 20 dollars for the bar.
In the past two weeks, the markets with co-coordinates were broken with financial diseases in Wall Street and also two powerful urians in Mexico.

The cost of the investors renewed in the Sunday, as well as after the President of the Congress reported that the agreement on weekly had been achieved about the largest saving plan in the history.
This report was raised up with a lot of fear that the financial crisis is at the end of a long time.
In the new episode of the progressing distribution, the Government announced that the Citigroup group buys a bank share of the Wachovia Corporation company.
The Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg Government shared the European Financial Communities for Fortis.
The Barclays Capital's analysis said that a week-end operation that led to the economy's safe plan, "theirs are shown as unable to survive the relief on the market."
As economic situation is worried, it is expected that the question of cocodities, including the rope, is lying.
"Communications for the markets with global actions, low samples and mixtures were strongly unnecessary," writed the Deutsche Bank analysis in the report to investors.
"We think the commissions will not be able to unnecessary.
From the commission perspective is our biggest concern in which the American virus is expanded throughout the world and especially in China."
The analysis of these banks restricted their expectations for the next year, as the consumption of the plants of the economic growth was reduced and reduced their prevention prices for 2009 at almost 20 %.
Further carrier in the second quarter of the team's record
After he treated Jets for the last eight seasons more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on the week, he watched the development of the second fourth, where Jets changed the unbound game in the Spanish ship.
"I never saw anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter started after Jets and Arizonales Cardinals raised their ruined games to the humble walls over themselves.
After the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveraneuse Colese to a twenty-yard touchdown sprint, which has completely submitted to the afternoon, in which their progressive cooperation was moved on miles forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter after two other touchdowns, including the cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half the pack.
"It was nothing weird," said Favre about all his games to Coles.
"It's a fucking good player.
We've been nice to communicate people to think anything."
While Favre and Coles were married, the Cardinals Curta Warner's quarterback was attached.
Cornerback Darelle Revis took a low horse and returned him about 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tricked another game and got it.
Linebacker David Bowens donutil Warner to fumble.
The last sword loss, fumble that Bowens used was probably the best.
The Cardinals team arrived 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the sword back, Jay Feely got twenty-year-year-old gol from the field, which has received guidance 34-0.
That's the best that Jets got in one quarter.
Look at Jets Eric Mangin, when he was called to describe this crazy, he said, "A second fourth, or the third quarter?"
When it was told him that both of them - Jets allowed 21 points without answer - Manguini said, "I can tell you the second quarter I used more than the third.
"It's been a lot of points in a short-time rate."
Initial Gebreselass improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many think of him as the best remote run, although in the week of the Berlin Marathon, he conferred his own world record and became the first person who struck 26,2 miles of long driving under two hours and four minutes.
Congratulation to a favorite board train at 2:03:59 over 27 seconds of his previous time 2:04:26, which was launched last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, which is 35, created the 26th world records of his carriers, which really is incrediblely wide - overcome the world record or at least a mysterious world on all distances from the metropolitic milk after marathon.
The last month Gebreselassie left the olympical marathon in Beijing because he feared - from the back view may be too disappointed - that the polluted vessels will disturb his problems with astmatic.
Instead, he promised he's going to Berlin.
At least perfect conditions - sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the goal, he wind Gebreselassie in the week-of-second of 4 minutes and 43 seconds.
What the traveling runs like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Keni were raised on a longer train, the Maraton record in the last decade of more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After weekly winning, Gebreselassie said to the newspapers that he had two weeks ago, he left training.
It's obviously raised him before she's stopped.
"I am so happy," he said to reporters.
"It was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a bit of doubts today, but everything was fine."
It was also criticized in Kenya, mostly in the Etiopia Etiopia Rival, because he had planned his commitments, totally exhausted by the world Marathon's marathon skins, raised on the water, as if it was a threat on the street, and established the world records on the meaning of the concurrence.
But this crisis can hardly reduce the large running quality of Gebreselassie.
In the time of four Kenya, Gebreselassie had half a time at 1:02:04.
After the vehicles were departed, Gebreselassie's two electronic ships of James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi shooted.
Something before three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie last took and fled to Kwambai, which then came to the second place at 2:05:36, and improved his personal maximum at least five minutes.
Kamathi ended the third time at 2:07:48.
In the case of the woman, Irena Mikitenk, a family of Kazachstan, which is now German citizens.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the Great Britain.
Sixty-year-old Mikitenk was surprised to win the lonely on the shore in London Maraton at 2:24:14.
The Peking Game left because of something that was described as a smoking back, but she turned and played in Berlin and in the third marathon, which she had been running, improved her personal maximum at least five minutes.
She was able to lie and industriel: she left the fourth of the Ethiopic and Kein ships to a large smoke and then took them at about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was the second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Keni ended the third time at 2:25:01.
Health and override of the Black Life in the separated city
Hidden between the farmers of the Old Orland, a few miles from all the lake, deep and robbery, remains silent town in which the hunger and the perspective of the African Life lives.
Eatonville, the first full full of black town, which was started in the state and where Zora Neale Hurston was trained his childhood, is no longer easy as he wrote in 1935: "The town of five ices, three hundred ships, three hundreds of good ships, good ships, coach, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a crazy place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Etonville festival of Zora every year, to make the Hurstone, the most famous woman writer of Harlemian renaissance.
The city that she wrote remains alongside, even though she made a tourist restaurant by attaching him to a Florida tourist manager created by the Federal Writers project since the period of economic crisis.
It's still so independent, perfect and private, as it was in the thirty years when the Hurston wrote that the foreign blacks in Florida were often disappeared and didn't share their real feelings with a white man who said, "We know so little that they don't know what happens."
Today, today, in the year when the Black President candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls to open discussions on race, remains a lot of citizens in respect of the views of strangers.
"We give a great attention to our story," says the 59th Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest farm in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville was long characterized as a paradox triumph and a mosaic.
It's like a historical model of the Black Regression, as a community at least 2400 people, where the poverty is a double-comprehensive turn to the global average.
It's a central literature, but also the smooth example of the Southern Foreign Cultural - sometimes rejected, sometimes excited - that has brought up from the American slave.
It's not too surprised that the citizens are like hungry, such as protectors.
And the worst of Eatonville's imagination was really beginning to Zora, which is the only way he says here.
He presented his birth city to the world through the heart books full of fulfillment as "Mules and Men (Muly and men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist leader has changed the city of the ship into the street #17, which leads often through the middle center of Florida, in the podium of black history and human drama.
With the idea of a big bubn in life and in the literature, the Hurston's readers brought to the business of the first Etonville old Joe Clark, and then returned to personal places.
"Left near the street," wrote she, "it's a white wrath of modern national school with well maintained trees and sins, about which Howard Miller is always old, even if he can't read nor write."
She also mentioned a new husband of Dashhov's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn's drinks of all kinds and all that corresponds to the hotel.
So in several hundreds of words, Hurston Eatonville has linked to the same right, but also with ingrammaticness, reuse of snippets and sex.
This was obviously not a typical training of Fodor's.
Actually, it was not a port that all would appreciate.
"Now she said how it was," says Ella Dinkins, one of the johnson girls who made Hurston's immortality because she cited men who singed about their beautiful songs.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
At Hurstone, she still remembers a perfect center that often returned after what her family was gone to the Florida Jacksonville.
The seventeenth Augustus Franklin remembers that most of them when he came to the city, she arrived without a publication in the Great Chevrolet, smoothed and brought calhots in the city that is still a lot of clothing.
Most of the citizens were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were smoking.
"The people of Zoru always like to see," said Franklin.
But, added, smoking on the ground terasis with looking on the ice of Sabelia, where Hurston was baptized with the greatest probability, "he never remained too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were issued from the pressure.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten the rest of the world.
Although the literary star, the present Langstone Hughes, and the only black black on Barnard College in the 20th century, was entered in a unidentified tomb in Florida Fort Pierce, where he lived before.
In Eatonville there were no larger mute officers or a large public reading.
"I think they didn't understand her meaning for the world, nor her link,," said Valerie Boydo, the manufacturer of Harston's lifebook "Wrapped in Rainbows (Zabaleno in the spirit)" issued in 2003.
The change has come in the 80s, 20th century.
The preliminary period of Orange County wanted to travel in the town of the southern town instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local dual route.
Orland's resolution has already traveled the International Downtown No. 4 on the west side of the city.
The proposal arrived in the time Eatonville has still been achieved from the sustained historical time.
Increasing integration, together with other things, has completed relatively idiotic isolation of this community.
In the fifty-years of the 20th century, he brought the battle on the mixing of race to hate to the work of the community.
"In that time, part of the white boys, they came and married the morning and things on people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"In fact, we had a lady who killed it.
They're getting out of the car meloon."
In the letter of The Orlando Sentinel from 1955, the Hurston's highest court requirement to integrate, and on his decision in case of Brown against the community for education announced that it was "for my race, which is more than the glorious."
The residents now say that the desegregation of school, even though it was positive in some areas, reduced the compatibility in Eatonville and submitted the desire of the younger.
"The Black Children were usually common to the object - I remember it - you have received your teacher tomorrow, you have received your teacher to the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and Executive Director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville community).
It was still until the teachers and requests went out of the same place, he added.
"You don't accept your white teacher, because your white teacher - I want to say there's a cultural barier," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the citizen rights helped to create space for many more Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, herds and artists, who have taken up the presidences of easy self-consciousness and citizens, such as "How can anybody write my future!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker was advised to the unidentified tomb of Hurston and began fighting for her report.
Five years later, he came to the police in the books of Hurston's lives from Robert E. Hemenway, who brought it back to the American canon.
The draft with a remote project was just at the moment when the greatest daughter of Eatonville found the light.
The neighborhoods of Hurston are now thinking about her as a savior.
To show what can happen to destroy her longer, the community started planning the Hourston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans have arrived in the inauguration action for two years later, and every leading is many returned to the celebration.
After a few years of the remote proposal.
"There five prouds have raised up, you would say that it's right down, a real cigarette," said Nathiri.
The Boyd said it simplely, "The day she saved Eatonville."
Victory on the remote project helped to change the image of the city.
The citizens like Rachel Munson, a lawyer who started to go to the latter cook in 1993 began to appear in a larger number, and the citizens began to review the past.
Eatonville was connected to the national historical record in 1998.
The new unpath library (only called after Hurston) was opened in 2006 for a re-accepted and exposed Kennedy's Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville's Floridian anomaly remains: only six miles from the center of Orland can sometimes bear as a west street in the air rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 19th century.
(Today is 90% of black.)
With strangers who are coming to look for the story and the significance of Eatonville, they are still often invisible.
The allowance for the majority of the conversation is necessary to have before and some things - as the most violent males in the oldest etonville cook that draw the whites and showing blacks on the fields - they cannot photograph them.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a serious, selfish teacher who loves the red network, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be understanded correctly.
And as the Houston's feast grew, he also increased the honey.
Especially young people are able to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse, and the same, creative, worker, poor and variety as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's son, the eighth-year-old Edwin Harvey, calls a loyal love to the neighbor when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in local government or police, who says that he would use some help.
And even younger, for example, 11-year-year-olds from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenono, as it seems to be learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The most people, when they're just going here, think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against these others," said Alondra Kenon recently on week after the kitchen.
"But if you really stop and look at the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we're all talking about financially.
There's nothing changed here on the first view.
If the tourists in Manhattan remain from new boards and television screens on Times Square, they wouldn't know that they stand in the middle of the wall.
They would never decide that officers on their heads, in the extent of the officers, have every day bankers and managers of investment funds, which monopolize New York, the worst "date in office" from the crisis from 1929.
The messengers still ran the cars after travellers and cut the muffin picks on the dinner meeting.
The Spanishs still move between the branches and the nuts, such as human mules, fifty out of the woods that leads from their backs.
The office crises are still waiting at the front of their morning bagel in the bunch of food tents, and they can't still be able to shoot in a day of yellow taxi between fourth and seventh.
It wasn't looking like a crisis until I was, with all things about Pesimism, he didn't decide to set up in the quarter of the weekend's account.
Although I was at the time of this job to hide from the afternoon afternoon on my local JP Morgan Chase, there was about twenty people in the front.
Not before the basic windows to carry out or save the preparation, but before the prevention where the elders of the customers are assembled the shock books, tourists are asked on the way to trade with the Macy's resources and the new advocats have a account.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Star, my "classed personal banker," came from the same reason as me.
However, they have already chosen their business from the small bank in the places where they came, such as New Jersey, Pensylvania or State Island.
They have chosen money from such thrifts (cool similar staff composers), money collectors and types that the pockets operate only in one State, and they say that their customers are as a family.
In the last year, 15 such a power bank was shortered.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with activity for 327 billion dollars, to the concurrence, and when the New Yorkers returned home a weekend in the evening, she tried another bank, Wachovia, with activity for 440 billion dollars, to buy a safe purchase.
Officers and businesses who stood before me and feared another copy, moved their preparation to the bank that is explored as a safe stage, which makes most saving in Wall Street.
The New Yorkers learned a lot of financially for the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke to the phone and she was published to Lehman Borthers, the rare bank, and to her mistake to the employer of the employer Dick Fuld with such familyity, as if she'd worried about a linear college.
And Lyn, the uniformed cigarette of my 50-year-old household, changed the subject of our normal conversion - Brad, Angelina or my food data.
After my visit in the bank, she said, "I now have my funds in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I'm not risking."
Muslim sepulchres deceived after the real crime of the Raka
Heinz-Christian Strache, the left, from the rakouc legal sides of the Freedoms and Philip Dewinter from Belgian legal party of Vlaams Belang was a participant demonstration presented in Antverpács on 17 January 2008.
There are no cedilles of similar transport tags that show the meshes of the overridged red line.
The police accuses the right extremists of the revolution of the Muslim grave in Rakous on the same week, in which extremely the rights parties have achieved several ships in all options.
At least 90 graves in the town of Traun in the near Linza, sometimes between the fifth evening and this morning, it was hard and the police is convinced that it was organized.
The victory rejected some of the Jews symbols, such as David’s star, but the detectives have been convinced that it could be a trial to massacre the motives of extremists led to muslim imigrants.
It isn't clear if this incident was just linked to choices.
The speaker of the islamic community said that they are "deeply shocked" reports of the innovation that comes in the moment when they are close to the end of the Muslim Post month Ramadan.
The ransom shall be entered into the road of looking for its own soul after the movement of the right in the last Parliament's options.
Both national rural parties, which have obtained more than 30% of the voices, the Freedom and Swazi for the future of the Republic, led a vast contradiction campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned as xenofabical.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Free parties who received more than 18 per cent of voices in the campaign protested against clothes and bottles, and even expressed his rebellion to the foods in which the relationship with the islam is made.
At the last meeting with the electoral in Vidni, he spoke about the "European Brothership" to defend the Islamic assembly.
Both parties are trying to deny the structure of measuring and minerals and argumenting that these are political symbols of the Russian and Europe's Islamic Islamism.
Research and analysis made immediately after choices, which have established extreme right on the position of the most strongest political block in the country, indicate that this change has been caused in particular by young choices who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter doesn't get out of the border
Gary Glitter, the glamrock star, which was judged for sexual use of children, urged the court to go to France and Spain.
The Officers adopted this six monthly command to Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he plans to leave France to Spain.
The Kent Police was the command of excuse the past fourth month after she had given the officers evidence of the previous decisions of glitter for sexual use of children.
Glitter, his own name Paul Gadd, was not involved in Ashford's smallest crime court in Kentu, but the lawyers of Corker Binning were adopted.
The Court of Justice said: "In February 25 September, at Ashford's latter Court of Criminal Court requested a Kens Police on the Regulation that would deny Mr Paul Gad to transmit the borders to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't participate personally."
A 64-year-old Glitter reported the authorities that he would go to a stranger, as it records him in the registration of sexual attacks.
He needs to report to the officers if he wants to go to the border for more than three days.
It should also provide the scheduled date of the police exit a week ago.
If the obligation to be informed by the authorities may be judged for five years.
The officer stated that no individual cases of glitter's potential paths after time.
The King Police said, "The Kent police will make everything necessary to protect children in this country or in the foreign country.
From our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have a lot of systems that control potential dangers more effectively.
Protect Kentu is the highest priority for the Kentu police, and we work hardly to monitor the behavior of sexual attackers, so that we reduce any risks for the minimum publicity."
Glitter returned to the British last month after he spent 27 months in Vietnam's prison for two girls in age 10 and 11.
When he was released, he went to Bancok where he had to go to London for years.
But he said he didn't feel good, and he refused to go to London.
The Taiwan authorities didn't let him go through the pass control and finally go to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he went back to Banco, where the Thailand police and the immigrants continued to return to the British.
22. August finally arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's latest crime court in West London and at the time Scotland Yard requested an order to register him as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was prisoned four months before in the United Kingdom for child pornography.
The inner Minister's resource said that Jacqui Smithova, Minister inside, is quiet and happy that Glitter was departed in France and Spain.
"To catch a real character, a picture of my master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No packs, no calls, no cooks.
Only the existence of the large masters of the flamenc, rejected from the middle of interpretation, is just the objective of a free expression of men or women.
On the one side of a friend.
On the other man.
Increasingly, if we take care of private, in those moments far from the public - then you can see the confidential gesture, the depth of the air of the spectrum or your hands that are insufficient because they are not able to get up to the scene.
German Günther Bauer guards theatre of theatrology with singers, tanks and cytarists with the less known faces of masters.
For this purpose, the photograph consists of a single flamming icon of various environments.
The expenditure, which is running in the framework of the Moon of Flamenca Photo (Mes de la Photoographie Flamenca), "the continuously increases the international meaning of flamenca," says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "perhaps to be people, but when you look at photographs, you will find that it's not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people's portraits "in the street" are the artists can transfer stress, suffering, joy... and entirely keeping wonders.
In order to ensure the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph on the eggs.
He's getting his personality and character inside.
I was interested in the creation of free atmospheres that allowed me to catch a large person of flamenca.
The festival "Cante de las Minas" started Bauer in 1997 a long way of transporting flamenc songs, kitarists and tanks on the table camera.
They're portraits that, thanks to photograph and materials, remember a classic photograph.
The payment of different stylistics is in contrast with the classic base of the image and provides the current spirit, which is the idea that Bauer is the same and flamenco: "Hudba with very traditional roots, but does not stop surrounding and exceeding."
This is not the promotion of a single dance, music or game, but personality and artist character.
The search of the moment when we meet the most sustainable, with the spirit that appears in the way of impression, lives and consumption, it was and it was a constant work present during these days in the El Fotomata galerie.
This choice of almost seventy photographed artists create known flamenca positions, which are other than Diego El Cigal, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Chanles or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become anticology of flamenca and soon is expected by the booking, which will contain the designed portrets.
The portrait was brought to Bauer two years ago to think about the idea to repeat the "Sport portraits" (Sportart Project).
Although it's their concept from "Flamenco-People" different, the photograph suggests that "fot people, know them, and have the possibility of a moment, to be longer or just shortly, entering into their lives -- it's my desire.
I think there's a portrait of the most difficult officer in the photograph.
A man is meeting or fighting with people, persons who never know, or give him a couple of minutes to photograph.
In the same area, I'm always trying to realize my presentations."
The port collection of the current flamenca named "Flamenco-people" is established in Gallerie El Fotomata in the street de la Mata 20, compared with Alameda de Hercules, and it is possible to visit it until October 16.
Wargas Llosa admitted that the Roman who wrote is "trailing"
It's going to be in the environment that still doesn't know, and he reports about the events of the unknown, although Mario Vargas Llosa agrees to successfully implement his new project - just works on a romain, which is the main heritage Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lives 20 years in Congo and walked in Amazonia.
The eternal favorite Nobel's prices for literature was yesterday on the Festival Hay Festival Segovia recognised that the project that just works for him is "this is trufality" and that "all proves that I should not write" this Roman.
"If I had a understanding, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and believe that I will end it once," concluded his article on the festival scene of ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the town of the writers, historys and newspapers and thousands of others.
Rome's author "City and psi" was one of the main positions of the third year's celebration of words and fulfilled waiting.
Vargas Llosa, who received the price of Hay Festival for the most favorite writer, - the oldest education of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" -, filled the divade John Bravo to the last place.
With Felix Rome, who led him, had an exchanged public before himself, which time was a time as a water - Peruan with a wonderful integrity and a notable dose of humor, remembered in it from the original "incredible welfare" from "the pleasure of your reader" and "the power to live more than what I live" as a literary posting; as the supplement of "the rest of inspiration" that the writer is "discriminally perfectly", the text is revised and revised; or how his phenomenon of his Facult, Victor, and Duremos, and his images are "the visions of his favourites."
The Spanish Romanographer allowed "no way" to detect whether and in what way the books can change life, "but I refused to believe that literature is able to use happiness, courageous experience" - showed Vargas Llosa with that, according to him, "the people of the ground" and "the endeavor is trying to choose from the line", and called the writer, "I don't want freedom" and "I'm going to take a responsibility" to himself."
For the climate's loss of feast in the Popolanc - missing copies
The exhibition of coffees that will celebrate the celebration in the Obsolence was interrupted yesterday after the confirmation of the notifications of the effects that the ground of the objective is not in a good state.
That is why the company with Fermin Gotthorquet, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández decided to interrupt ships.
Inappropriate meteorological conditions of this celebration follows longer, two of the three holidays could not be accomplished.
In the Sabbath, the rain has disappeared the process of other planned shoes.
While they were formed by Joseph Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, they had to put the balls in the area in Castilblanc.
It's just the fifth.
The winning became Daniel Luque, who struck three ears and rewarded for dynamic and costly quality exhibition was brought out on the frame.
At the same day afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two shirts to the health and one ear that brought him almost unlocked sitting in the area than the tourist science.
It's still bigger than El Juli, who's passed through the ransom of Los Llanos.
In the second round of the tree without a single department, he served a critical island from the majority of the obsence.
They've been checking in Alaba with two thousand kilograms of hashish
10 minutes for five.
Silicial control of Ertzaintz in the city of Arminion, Alaba.
The employees stop two persons who eat in the ship and you want them.
For example, more than two tons of shoes, it's not to stop.

At the end of one of them, the composers of Ertzaints cut off and broke 2 178 kilograms of hashish, who surprised how it came to see the Iveco Daily tag.
The Background part of the vehicle was established hashes packages which were recently transmitted to other police departments to detailed expertise and drug evacuation.
The police also discovered that the recognition tag was "including" and not agreed with the data referred to in the evidence of the additives, therefore the prisoner was also accused of false state documents.
The Ertzaints continued in the past after the second subsequent survey, which has already been mentioned, has been able to ensure that it may be finally determined the origin of drugs infected.
A. A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to a policy department to equipment of relevant forms before it arrives later to the next investigation.
Heritage Heather Locklear was arrested for the vehicle under the influence of medicines

This person also warned the safe service because "the fear of Locklear's life."

As a great literary writer of Galdose José Luis Garci says that he had been fulfilled by the attack of this movie, for thanks to the Esperance Aguirre, who had been in three years ago after the Autonomic Province of Madrid. He took an offer for Episode to the two-year-year-old Madrid 2 May, he accepted an offer that he would go out of Epizod National Old.
A number of 15 million, which was completely supported by the Madrid Province, means "the unique opportunity" for Garcia to create environments with cooking and cooking corresponding images "the Treaty of Spain, which was mistaken in the leader, which was going to fight - fight for independence led to the Government of Ferdinand VII. to the case and the rest of the country."
But the regimer is not able to calculate the financial support that came to films Short Crystal (Ala serious) or Goyo's wonders - at least two-seconds of Friday blood -, he could therefore not touch some scenes from the scene of the horaci Valcárcele, which works at least through his film train.
The film "Restart again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usually normally - on the scene with the heroes that usually tests and it is not selected by the casting, because it looks like "powering" and also thinks that "the registry's condemnation will go outside the divadal and the kid and then know what is happening in the room that is occupied."
Many herds who have chosen for Monday blood are already discovered before his camera, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations in Oskara, from which one received, is the view that no of three candidates of the representatives of Spain this year before Hollywood Academy, the only May's blood, the seven tables of the French billor and the last chosen Sun Sleep, is not the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but it says that "the first appears".
Garci doesn't expect any evaluation for this film.
"In the beginning you think you're working for what's going on, but then you know you're working only for the division, and then you're going to make another film more," explains Garci with more than 30 years of restrictive career.
Isabel Bayon survives the spiritual link of the Seril tank Tórtoly Valencia
The Sevills Dance of the flamenca cancer gives the hold of another semily tank.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalance (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanky (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the fourth Triana, and when it was three years, they moved with the family to London.
She danced the modern tank and turned on the east dancing.
She lived full of life, was a copy of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a buddhist and a vegetarian, and she was fighting for the destruction of the curriculum that was able to move women freely.
The lives of this woman affected tane and ethnic revolution of the Middle-Europe of Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepo Gamboa, and she proposed this situation -- it seemed incredible."
According to the tank, we're not about the explanation of her life, but for the capture of the soul.
The names of her tank presentations reminded me of the flamenco rings.
So, "Danec Motylla" packed a guajiru or a "Danec Hawai" a dance.
Her tank was sensitive and told me that my tank of this street is also answering," she says.
The presentation is calculated by introducing two exclusive personalities: with Miguel Poveda, which will sing Isabelle in one exit as in the "Open doors" (La Port open), and with the teacher of Matilde Coralo, who made the exception and came to cooperate with his old chair.
"Matilde represents an elder Thortol, a crazy position.
I'm happy that she took the offer to share in my project, and it's a great honour for me."
In the presentation, it also counts music and cytars of Jesuse Torrese and Paca Arriage, with Miguel Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Moron; Bubny El Pajar, violation of Rafa El Violy and collaboration of the hero Juanfrey Juárez, "which has an eternal job of the manner of this kind of art that are primadons with all of them, and who are always merciful to them."
In the case of this woman, who has been able to live for its time in so far as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think she was of those women who have a great influence in some time, but no one knows her today and still appreciates her creation," says Bayon.
The presentation begins today at 20.30 in the divadle Lope de Vegy.
The book "The Loyal Journal of the Women" closes the trienal
The introduction of the first illustrated edition "Day of the Women's Day" in St. Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramon Jiménez concluded the celebration of Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of Autonomic Islamic Government on the celebration of "Trinal Zenobie and Johannes Ramona" (2006-2008), which was ordained to celebrate the age of 50-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-olds.
"The Treaty of Zenobia and John Ramona" is going to end with the new issue of this work, the international congress, which will be held in New York, the assembly of Nobel's museum house, and the exhibition "John Ramon Jiménez: Onen papsek sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after the assembly of the various province, it should be according to the plans of the convention during the convention.
The Cultural Council of the Italian Government also included eight hundred expressions of the "Department of Women" made by Pedre Taberner and the Illustrated Jacob Pérez-Encice, to continue in the wide extension of the knowledge of personality and the role of one of the most convinced Italian boards.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like so much.
"It's sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of Sally Field's heritage, who collaborated with him on "The bad mind" and under the courage of knowing that Newman has gone away, disappears his unfortunate vision left American kinematography and all America.
Look how they had been waiting before Oskara getting.
And that he was in the past since 2007.
And that they knew he was hardly sick.
And it was for all the boys.
"It's sometimes what a man feels can't tell any way, and I've lost a big friend," said Robert Redford, "My life and my country were better for him."
Nobody's afraid it's funny or it's going to start.
He died the father of the film and power in particular a dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, during the time he's American self-consciousness on the day when they're defectly looking for reasons for hungry.
When the time is weird and people without honor, and only the worst of those who stand for you - it's not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He had almost a platonical ideal of beautiful and truth for all.
Richard Nixon was a official refugee and a fighter for lost and exposed cases, from the position against the drug commitment based on the number of the firstborn son, who died for transmission until the own mark of home food and biopopulation.
A full cost for the land that has been a lot of efforts to grow from self-sufficient suicide culture.
Hollywood's bourished fields, without nationality or national competence.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no man died, but all one error.
Another English, officer Oskara for Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman was without the survey of his carrier.
The bad hoch from Australia, Russell Crowe, found Newman to mark for his greatest inspiration source.
"The sticker has set up a lot of high lot to us all," constats George Clooney, maybe one of the little ones who have the mind today trying to live as Paul Newman lives - based on respect and leads a series of private life far away from the camera.
It's not always easy in today's medical jungle, sometimes even even even possible.
But the luck of such people are, and Paul Newman is their form.
He was divorced once, and since that time he was married forty years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more experience than the opportunity to be.
"Why would I go out to hamburger when I have a filet home?" I liked to smile.
Let him in the sky make horrible to that the coherence of his daughters and employees on earth is not too common in America.
It says that "of all the great roles that he shared was the most slightest role of the dedicated husband, the loved father, the desired unclean and the victim of the filantrope."
Incomplete Olympian Madrid
Yes, many of us will like to finish the olympiad in Madrid, and after the past year 2012, it will be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we're going to go to the ship yesterday, I say no!
He was talking about him as a perfect condemnation, and according to my judgment, he was the worst thing I was on.
That dream of unconsciousness that immediately, if it comes to the evaluation and I was trying, it would be clearly necessary.
But let's look at this from the beginning, a good one after the other.
The senses begin with the introduction of a binary number, for which a person must be expressed before.
It doesn't seem bad, but when a man goes there, they give him everything (including the chip that must prevent the ways).
No, no.
Here a man had to first take a number (the first sense, go there only for that) and (on the extinction of the fronts) - what a surprise - they had only three-sized size S (the second sense, because I need XL size).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy only a small trick because it's a little substance and they're better?
All right, it's a little bit in comparison with what happened on the day of ship.
Besides that she had to go very soon for the chip and the front stayed on him over 15 minutes, he had to get a bath.
Over 35 minutes she was waiting for a time, which is on the ground where 11,000 people are expected, something unbelievable.
So, as it had been waiting, it started, and we didn't put down the bathrooms, and when it's already done, it was much worse.
In addition, the waiting was longing for 40 minutes of rain, which led to the universe emergency and the cabine attack.
I believe that 500 of us will have to build a travel tomorrow, and some, like me, will not show the right time in the evaluation of the results for the chip that gave me, and who, as I imagine, didn't tell me the right time of the start.
Of course, if someone asked me for a perfect conviction, he wouldn't have found me.
And then I think we're gonna have to be ready for an olympian town to just put it out.
Microsoft searchs receipt (virtual)
At the Conference of New MIT Technologies, Microsoft introduced further development in the new image recognition system and human interactions in the way of intelligence - not too intelligent but able to implement basic tasks as to call taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, an e-mail that would be moved through the entire area of society) and the understanding of what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to the room and the system that recognizes faces and faces, this "recept" can find how many persons are in the room who are - even remembering what they have on themselves - and hearing and understanding the key words of their conversation.
It can also distinguish the future in accordance with the conversion groups.
The demonstration video indicates the third person and understands that it does not correspond to the group that speaks with it and that it is not a company's employer.
She asks if someone's gone, and she gives her that she's gonna take her for a moment.
That's all without a blue screen of death.
Awesome.
But, of course, it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to work, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week was a lot of discussion about the change of Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier, and they will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer came to that if the computers had only the most necessary, without the market residence, they would have been five times more executive -- man, Steve, they'd always be lower.
Find as a game when we notice that Microsoft version from version adds to the new Windows function and another "extra".
The change of the direction would be a responsible action.
Microsoft's right, the operational system is shortly lost significant and similarly on this software.
When you found Google Chrome on the network, I became one of those who are involved to the theory that it was the first step of Google to competition with Windows.
Many have shown rightly that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is necessary to understand between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something tiny.
That's right.
It's never missing, but it's necessary to think about the "Death" operating system not as an absolute truth, but relativly.
What Ballmer said this week, this idea confirms.
People take less attention to the operating system and even more web browsers.
The computer is running to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we'll travel more time on the Internet than around windows.
What is the half of the applications that carry out the system?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
More hard, less based, less complex.
Microsoft has now interested in offering his online services and finally becomes alternative to Googlu.
I've got a little example here.
I made this photo in one restaurant for Microsoft's business in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the drink car, it was to plot that it would ask them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used to search for Google online.
Last week with the outside confirmed a new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come to the beginning of the year 2009, but at the end, let's make it easier to calculate since 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to apply on Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone's looking for more computers.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll have to pay for the supply of the dragon.
The Fabulous Marcel
Paul Picasso took him on the Azuric border, Leonardo di Caprio in one record in the "Blue Diamant" Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly, and also part of the uniforms of the communist gay.
And if we want to go into the account of his life role, we can be raised up to the picture of a typical slave with a smooth cycle that brings acts in a cockpit circle.
In fact, it's nothing more than the typical cups of the master's soil, lifted, and without hands.
The English speakers call him 'dank', but the Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels is exceeding all the others.
First for his crown name - even when the people call him "Marcel" - who has a relationship with the sport, because, as he tells the legend, was named by the boxer of Marcel Cerdan, the favorite song of Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' is exceeding the other quality ball, unisex shooting, different steel and (a lot of not known) Belgian balls, which have the models of the most increasing tickets as the details of the bridge.
And watch, because Belgian company is not only specialized on the tank tops.
It also produces microscopes, back boxers, boxers, cashrooms, balls, sea tricks, clothes for kids, mini...
Industrial cuts for a suitable underwear.
Although it's threatened to be just a smoke.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, whoever will be a father, I don't care."
The great love of her sister didn't protect her in their own personality development.
Monica Cruz is a woman full of life.
Your new work in the way they'll take Cruz's sister very seriously.
For Monica, it means much more than just that some beautiful, honourable girls are going to make his name.
In Paris, the promotional action that Mango was organised in his new seat, and the statement of the unexpected moderate prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's amazing and amazing, and she's close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to imagine a new collection that we proposed to sister Penelope for Mango on the airport section, and I also participated in the statement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the evening at Opera for the counter of Valentine.
So it was amazing, but, like, a amazing day.
What's your new collection for the Mango company for which you're working for the fourth series?
I and my sister love movies from 50 and 60 years, and of them we're a lot of branches.
I love too much to go through the city and observe women how they walk in clothes, how they combine their clothes and shoot their clothes, I do very often.
You're a dance, a heritage, a suggestor, so you're a very strange woman, right?
I think yes, but the end of the end is linked and has a lot of confidence.
I needed to be disappointed, I still wanted to go to the grandmother, to go in my teenagers and look at her clothes.
It was a missing, as well as better to go to the river.
Then when I was a tank, I always tried to watch how I was clothed.
Yet you know we're tanks based on how we're ready to make our hours and trials to look at the shirt.
And as a hero, when they give you cow, then you'll really go to the stage.
So everything is linked, however, with great respect to proposers and professionals.
Have you been 30 years old, did you get a crisis on you?
Where is it?
I feel better than ever before, thirty-shirts are coming to me.
I'm sure that the woman's already ready, my experience and my life's mistake with less mistakes.
Biological hours don't give me fun.
I refused to do what I want, and it gives me a great inner happiness.
So you think it's a mother or not?
Of course I know I'm a mother because my body's asking it, and I want to be a young mom, I don't want to proceed it.
If it's about my father, I'm not worried about it.
But I'm sure I'm sure that I'll give my child to enjoy the feelings of happiness and I'll save him with a loving love.
If it's about a movie, it's waiting for you now a few film premises that you've touched.
It's so, and I'm happy when they're coming to the kitchen.
I'm going out of the divadal world, and so I'm very unfortunate and quiet, I want everything right now, and of course it's not.
I'm glad to the Premier "The last hour" and "In search of the Tumba of Christ."
Well, how they'll like you...
A few days ago, you had your premier on the survey of Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that I'm going to get on the molo as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell called me, which I have already known, and invited me to London to participate with the beneficial views for her organization "Women for a better life" and the clothes we have predicted - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - and the effort was made for this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has so good heart.
She's talking about her, and I, as I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Moreover, I'll keep the good thing he's concerned.
She asked me to prevent her for good purposes, but if she asks me to make me a staff, I'll do it too.
In the effort of a woman in the third world, I'll do whatever needs.
The directors have to install the "alcolock" once again.
The Ministry is required to be managers with three administrative sanctions for the management of the alcohol influence in his cars to install a system that will be able to launch the car in the steel or if it is unnecessary.
The proposal has already been informed in June this year, and now it is already held into the report of the Highest State Department, according to which it is a pilot project that has a year.
His goal is to return managers to call, therefore the managers will also have to solve the course of transport transmission.
In this experience, except the National Transport Security Agency will also share the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Nadace Technology for Automobile Security (FISA).
According to the statistics between 30 and 75 % of the vehicles committed more than one of the ones for the management of the exploitation in this state used as a voter.
Alcolock should be prohibited, because it is a system connected to the vehicle, which measures alcohol in the exploited air, and invokes to launch the car, if the driver is unnecessary or if it is higher than the authorised concentration of the alcohol.
His price is over $1,000 €, and it's supposed to have a wine alone.
In this regard, the study in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles of this equipment were reduced to 65 % in the first year since the introduction was reduced.
In Spain, it counts that every year can save life to 115 people.
The measures are limited to the administrative sanction for two reasons: to resolve this procedure before the execution of a criminal action.
In order to help his introduction, since legal reform is in a common way, the necessary amendment of criminal provisions requires a change of the law.
The device is not yet available on Spanish market in no vending version, even though in some industrial vehicles and public services were already already installed.
Tomorrow, the Congress will vote on the proposal of PSOE (Spanish Socialist Side), in which it is recommended to install this system in school bus, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without Peeptoes
With the Britannizedness, in 17.40 hours, as he stayed in the programme, the President's spanish campaign was in the aviation of Benita Juárez in Mexico D.F. aviation of Spanish air forces in which the prince and princess were accessed from Asturia.
The sun just appeared, however, his pairs were still encouraged to close his eyes, so that it might be possible to see the following couple out of the air.
Under the congress, there was a Spanish majority and other functioners.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxier to ask if he knows that the Spanish prince coming to the State visit.
- Yeah, that's great, that's not going to get people on the airport in this time... she's out of there or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
Mexican pressure, however, knows who are princes and princess of Astury and how significant their visit is.
Many people are waiting at the airport at the royal cup and the soldier cordon, which creates 27 sea soldiers prepared to shoot honour safe.
Prince appears with a smile on the skins in the dark colors and princess, very strictly clothed and developed hairs, she has not its normal "peeptoes", often reported her that the horrible battle in D.F.
Before they go to the room where the official delegation is waiting, they're lying on photographs and they're injured to them.
At the doors of the hotel where they will live, one of the four largest in the city, waits for them a mexican television reporter.
The best adjusted moderate price
Probably there's no more appropriate place to declare a moderate price than Paris and probably is not the most significant proposal and bovine than Valentino.
Firma Mango just published the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation to new talents in the area of mode.
The price is granted to a total of 300 000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrin Fasoli, the first year's guest, saw his proposals yesterday in Manga's exhibition on Paris Buddha 54, and almost fled.
Of course, it's the second biggest business of this company in Europe and was just opened on the desktop 1 335 feet.
The biggest is located in London.
A lot of events together to thank Valentino's proposals for the President of the Court of Justice, made us finally attended in Paris Oper Garnier.
Mango's office, a honourable presidency table, looked at the most significant Chagall's works, looked forward to something more wonderful.
Nati, with a heart of deceit because of the recent death of his brother, did not find anything, clothed the clothes of the ELAH marks and the springs of ELAH, on which he hid the darkness, and entered into his son Louise - at least two meters of elegan - brought Valentine to the table at the part of his feast.
Andick, boss and leader of Mango's company, asked the welcome, and as a true juvenile stayed together with Rothschild's boss, because they were both offered to two sons.
Moon Cruz, which came to the business in - personally proposed - challenges and kissed and at the evening, took a night travel after Opera for the Goy Toled, showed us a room for ballet tests, and at the reminder of other times, one of the tickets and signed "grande".
Inés Sastre was not held on a look after the next building balls, but before the department showed us the photos of his son in the mobile phone.
The next morning we could love Olivier Martinez - another young man who leads to the motor - and John Travolt, who came to Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own rolling and hands and asked that no use in his rooms.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001 - Anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotical and regular life.
And so that it's not a little, all are broken in one book that will be brought to a relax book on September 30.
The building of call every morning at 7 hours as a penalty, but the worst is to imagine himself in a successful ritme that brings the present life.
The office's name is an emergency and the computer's pain behind.
Stres is sick in the 21th century.
However, there is no one or two methods of fighting each day to be disappointed and to repeat problems from the world of work.
No, this number is not about nothing bigger and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside the joint position, classic massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of his books, gathered the whole "menu" options that were corrected according to the input and time options of each individual.
The Protistros Book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra library and DK is brought to the challenge book.
If someone has that it is not possible to get calm in such areas, such as work or personal relations, the "man" does this view.
Moreover, there are further procedures, as to be contacted with natural or 100% of natural receipts associated with relationship.
If you don't have adrenalin in the living living, who's raising the equation in the body again, and stres becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the gaucher, cut off and focus on the reading.
Sleep talks
Some kids speak in the night.
I don't think those who are coming and who tell us something that happened before day, but the children who speak while they sleep.
When it happens first, maybe it's gonna get you out, but it's actually incredible.
It's one of the unfortunate dream that is called a dream.
She's totally often, especially in children and young people.
Of course, the only one of you told you he talked about sleeping night.
This sport may be very sportly (e.g. one for life at high horse), or with greater regulation (all day, one week, one for a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There is no only one reason to explain her approach.
Sometimes it is connected to other sleep shoes, such as night mills, night rooms, enuresis (noth help), or mentality, but it does not need to be so.
As it was mentioned before, sometimes it can bring very high horse, stress or discovery situations.
In each case, it's a lot of disagreement.
Intensity, with which it appears, is also different.
The child can talk with silent voice, speak single words, shut, or just attractive (crying, weeping, long words...).
In the case of a great strength, it would be a right child to observe and to consult the representative to find whether there is no problem that calls a great challenge, and it is in this way.
We said that it's one of the disagreements, so it's not soon to be treated, only if it is associated to another dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is a syndrome or a permanent stream).
However, we can do that we will have a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying the kid to stop before he's sleeping.
So look for peaceful games and go out with fearful or in some violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who are free of work can be used relaxing techniques that help them get a certain internal peace.
It's a kid's more quiet sleep.
When it appears to the dream, try to keep calm.
Remember that it's unbelievable for the child and that it will not remember anything from what happened on the second day.
Useful Councils
Don't be him.
It's too much because it's not at the science and you can interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if you look like a few times after yourself, it's very threatened, it would be appropriate to turn on the advice or find out what you're looking for.
If you understand what he says (what doesn't be so common), take out the trial to hear him and get information from him.
It's not going to do anything, because when he sleeps, it's not when he knows that it's going to make sense of thoughts.
Moreover, you can hear what he says, but you don't know what he seems, and then why it says, so give a great attention to how you interpret information and what conclusions you're going to do.
Don't tell the kid that you can ask him at his secret night.
Not a funeral.
This calls a great depression.
Don't be careful, it's nothing bad, it's just episode that's just a few minutes.
Illaeuser... finally
Illaeusern finally found a way to win after a long huge time again.
Unless they would be glad of a great challenge, the yellows made more chances and made one of them to win.
The game wasn't at this timing in which the avoiders were just hard, too quickly.
After the first trial of Captain Kauffmann, who was shooting from the length of the shooting only on the shooting of the last time, he began to have Illlaeuser leaving up the top and first Fonderflick from the way, then Hirne air, Romein on the long feet, or Diebold also came to steal the protection of Dannemarie.
In contrast, the supply set in half a defenced val and left only Riahi's agil.
The beginning of the second half was shown as a decision, and it was first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Tempral, then after opening the cooler for Illlaeusern, about which Marais, well located for the processing of the mixed mixed after the previous Debold's trial (53').
However, Gholman Illlaeusern had no longer rejoiced, probably after twelve minutes he was urgent to return to the shadow and to leave his partner in the slow.
However, Dannemarie could not be satisfied, and the eleventh of Illlaeusern, who just got a little time to "defeat" the defense, he had no more difficulties, except the full of the last weeks of the story, when the middle of the great smoke went very close to March.
Sarkozy is inside the broken fishermen
Nicolas Sarkoza will make an interest in the United States.
In order to demonstrate the forces of fishing forces that were strongly discharged on the lunch, the French President decided to come to Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives in the morning.
Finally, the names promised that he would accept "in constructive spirit", and they hope that "he's coming with specific proposals."
The Chairman's visit comes at the same time as a valid meeting of the "Christian Committee" established by the Brazilian fishermen to get measures against the excessive increase of the price of the naft, which has achieved the top of 1,14 euros for litri.
According to the Elisei Pallas David Martinon, the President will talk about solutions that can be made to help their company to reach competitive capacity and to ensure the conditions of employment and deployment of mariners.
Nicolas Sarkozy is a fishermen waiting for disappearance.
On the morning, they carried out a "smoking" operation in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, which had been deadly 10 km.
The recreation staff in Quiberon was also blocked, however, the connections in the direction to the Belle Island were not interrupted.
On the Kiberon Floor, the filter override was made.
The Netherlands showed their decisive decision on the Sunday when immediately, in the presence of the smoking flows in Brest and Lorientu, the pneumatics and palettes, while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc were offered a demonstration.
The smoking was extended to other ships on the south of Atlantic and the channel la Manche, as to Sables d'Olonne in Vendee, where traulors remained in the ship, or Le Havru, where about 20 ships were blocked by the carrier.
Rivers from Turball and Croisc in the area of Loire-Atlantic at the evening stopped a block of important Total rafiner in Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mar decided to wait before they decided to act eventually, to the central meeting on the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "Christian Committee" is therefore to decide on how to continue on the right path, and on its participation for prepared meetings to the Ministry of Agricultural and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Bretonian fishermen do not want to be adopted by the representatives of the State Agreement of Fisheries, which did not support them.
"The stage will continue" because "the fishermen of nothing will be left" and "they don't want to go to Paris", for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the fishing counsel in Lorien.
The fishermen of the call that don't pay the payment of the naft are currently paid about 50 cents per litro, but judges that the ship's rate is achieved only when the ship is under 0,30 euros for litre.

Obama played on the point in the first TV dual
After the first fifteen debatte between both candidates in the White House followed the second debat, which was the job to find who was winning from John McCain and Barack Obama.
The major states of the campaigns and democratic campaigns were not surprised when both communicated their victory in the TV dual, which had seen the third American families.
Political analysis David Gergen is thinking that John McCain, as well as nice, was not enough "britain" to allow him to stop, five weeks before the President's choices, pulled in research.
The rate of Gallup, which is published in the Sabbath, admits Obam's five-year-old smoke (49% against 44% for McCaina), judges that the democracy is the democracy who won in dual.
In the middle of non-decisive volunteers, Obama is a winning for 39% asking, while, according to CBS investigation, 25% accuses the winning of McCain.
Obama should have the opportunity to confirm its lead in the fourth through the proposed good execution of his partner Joseph Biden, during the first and even the only public debates with his supporter Sarah Palino.
"It's not gonna be worth it.
He's noticed, but he's noticed about the week of Bill Clinton.
Seventeenth McCain made his unpiratable experience on the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the frontal policy, as well as the "nativity" of his support in issues created the nuclear of the first struggle.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." it's like a reacted accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experiences and knowledge to be president," he also ensures.
In this avoided spirit, the Republican TV spots were not held yesterday.
In contrast, both of them showed that he represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and showed himself as a straight and precise.
He exalted his ability to adopt the right decision and to renew the good news of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama was," he replied about the week of the democratic spot, which says to the republic that it doesn't be enough in the attack of the crisis on the "American".
"In the 19th debates of John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," he spoke to Obama yesterday before 200,000 people gathered together at the former meeting in North Caroline for a raining rain.
He did not mention the words as "center class" or "working". Financial distribution is aware of the Oba, which the Americans consider to be more able to save the economy on the border of the propaganda.
"The next week it could be decided to be returned," said the influenced Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, ancient member of Clinton's administrative member, compared Obamo's "Economic Surveillance" to whom Bill Clinton had in the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of the Democratics, the current group is "the final value of the eight-year-old economic policy, as George Bush conducted it and how the Senator McCain supported it."
The Senator of Illinois reaffirmed that, through the unexpected roads of Wall Street, he should reduce the 95% of the Americans, and also advised that the implementation of eventually energy independence of the country by providing renewable energy resources is its priority number of one, together conducting the health insurance system.
McCain again plans to set a park with 45 nuclear electronics for 2030.
Both candidates were carefully issued by the questions on the financial assistance plan for 700 billion dollars (470 billion eur), which took the Congres last night and which is strongly unpopular.
"What are you, you know that there's some choices in Minsk?"
Young people and refugees have demonstrated the regime on weekly on the main subject of the white main city to reject the results of Parliament's elections before.
Some hundreds of the Bielorus were gathered together on weekly after the closement of the election rooms on the main subject in Minsk to protest the illegality of the elections to the Parliament.
Although there were no results, many young people came to demonstrate the mode of President Lukašenka: "Digitator, demis."
Some recognize that they didn't go to the choice, "What would it be, when they will do the same thing they want to do," says one younger.
They don't believe that this mode, which was directly maintained to external observators to re-new cooperation with the European Union, would have been prepared to implement directly to democracy.
Sankce, between which the order of visa for 40 white heads and destruction of some activity may be interrupted in the case of the options will be considered clean.
It wasn't like that, according to the obsession.
"We were maintained further from the election Commissions and our observators were not able to participate in the number of voices," followed Juri Potemkin, speaking with the Democratic forces of the Union, a variety of multinational companies of twelve parties.
"It's about cosmetic change," advised Alexandr Milinkievič, an old optical candidate in the President's elections of 2006 and the leader person of the European migration, "and it's essential for us to read the voices, and it's fulfillment.
If some opposition messengers are reached to the Parliament, they will be named and no one will be chosen.
However, their income to the Parliament may mean a television space, meetings in regions and proposals."
The opposition is therefore necessary to participate in the political function, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
But if our economy, the deeply involved in Russia, is a crisis, and we don't reform, we're worried that we're a Russian protester.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe, which monitored the choice procedure, would not pronounce the options for validity.
The participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of the previous vote (26 % of the electorals in Minsk) has opened the path of all possible manipulation.
"What are you, you know that there are some choices?" says the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisons released in August this year.
"In choice rooms there was no feet.
And in Parliament, there will be maximum of five opposition messengers, those who are most exchanged in the mode."
The night's silence has reached the royal room.
In the TV, President Lukašenko and the Central Election Commission welcome to success.
Disputation - blood that is reassured
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth-year-old income and his president, Dr. Francine Decary, was rightly joyed because Hema-Quebec became one of the most popular and ineffective blood additives in the world.
First, he reached the confidence of publicity that was restricted after the scandal with a contaminated blood in 80 and 90 years.
As generally known, the State blood reserve of the Canadian Red Cross transfusion was contained by the virus of immunity deficiency (HIV) and the virus of hepatitis C.
In accordance with this drama, the Canadian Government has not completely started the public investigation of the President Horace Krever and had to explain the circumstances to such tragedy, and to form recommendations that it should not be repaired anymore.
While the Court Crever continued with the report, some provincies brought to the Committee on which the purpose was to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this job has been the committee of Geneline.
Following Gélineau and Krevera report, two additives were made in Canadian: Hema-Quebec, which had to focus on Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for all provincies and both territorys.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activities in 1998, about 38% of people had yet confidence in the chequebeck blood system," Remembers Dr. Decary.
"The situation was smoking.
Consolidated efforts to increase the safety of blood products and staying work in this area during the following years, we have reached public confidence," says Hema-Quebeku adds that in the beginning of 2008, Hema-Quebec had already trusted 94 per cent of whatbeck population.
Dr. Decary, however, doesn't lose the pioneer that "the trust is something very green."
Hema-Quebec has already applied the principle of obsession since his date on 28 September 1998.
"Therefore we were witnesses in Europe to make a number of cases of human forms of diseases, new variations of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease," says a woman whose company leads from her construction of 1998.
"And we didn't think this disease could breathe blood.
Therefore, we have reported on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gelineau's reports, in the case we don't know, and when it is in the absence of a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, which describes the brain degeneration of the brain leading to death, is necessary to take out exemption.
In April 1999, we rejected blood from people who remained in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, then, it was safe that this disease was overcome.
So this episode showed us that to keep the principle of obsession was meaning."
In 1999, more supplementary technology to detect HIV: tests with use of nuclear acids (NAT), which allow to decline in the dark blood directly in the presentness of the self-virus, and non-existence of the contradictions based on the tests used before.
The NAT tests were allowed to reduce the deep-term period that is at the moment of loading the patient and the time when we can be our technology in the blood of the first virus, explains specialists.
This time we've made it to split at less than a week.
We had a risk so reduced that some donors could be able to be loaded, unless they knew it, and we couldn't do it.
This improvement allowed explicitly to reduce the risk of AIDS reaching through blood transfusion.
The risk that can get the blood of HIV contaminated is today one of 12 million.
"Any words, it means that before any HIV, 12 million blood products will be distributed.
Considering that Hema-Quebec is distributed every year 400 000 to 500 000 blood products, Hema-Quebec will be 24 years before the first case of HIV transfer is appeared through blood product.
I have that we can get or prescribe blood transfusions today to heal, "the chief leader of Hema-Quebec says.
"The call for the next decade is to keep our safety of our products.
We never know what disease elements can be found in the system.
Just last year, Reunion found a chikungunya virus, which is like a Western Nil virus.
Dr. Decary continues to be invisible, and indicates that Hema-Quebec should also be considered sufficiently.
"It's gonna need growing, because the population's smoking.
In the consequence of agressive treatment of racobines, patients often need a new red dose or blood distillation.
The population has also the results of blood donors network, which is in the middle of 3% of the Quebecians allowed to be given."
Each health person is at least 18 years old, the criteria of performance, but he can give blood only one for 56 days, that means six times for year.
14 per cent of people offering blood is not merely accepted because they are AIDS or Malaria, and if they visited the country where the grounds are ranged, they are excluded after a year.
"There are 3% of this, we can keep the status that corresponds to the needs of the hospital.
Not enough are very weird.
However, the donor network members must be fulfilled directly by the smooth and can't give blood anymore.
However, to convince people to give blood, it is difficult, especially to keep them, and to make them a regular gift.
Life is so unbelievable today that we'll just find a hour to give blood, "France Decary's bed.
With an annual budget of 297 million Hema-Quebec, it adds not only blood products, but also human shipping, such as cool transplantations, heart clothing, eye balls and cups that are almost used for large pools.
These teams are analysed, processed and discharged before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also controls the only public blood bank from the puppy shirts in Quebec.
Pupe shirt, which was considered previously as biomedicine department, spreads the blood of a disease on cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"Before a few weeks, we celebrated the input of our thousand blood models from the puppet shirt to the bank, and we suggest that we're going to get them over thousands of years.
In the beginning of the next year, we should begin to offer them to the transplantation," declares Dr. Decary, which is a very favorable test of blood from the puppets.
"Some moms are claimed that they have no access to him," because Hema-Quebec doesn't have enough means to offer this complex and dear program to all the hospitals in Quebec.
Fotbal - Impact in seminal
Impact Montreal was yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and even the decision of the fourth-final rate played for the total number of gates, qualified in the seminar round of the seminar ring of the first USL division, thanks to win 3:1 (4:3 is a total balance after both boards) over Sounders from Seattlu.
The booker Antonio Ribeiro gave a decision-maker in 90 minutes of game.
After both without-branch first half, the booker David Testo and Rocco Plancentino remaining two parts of the monstreal form.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could consult Matt Jordan for Sounders.
Remember that in the fifth of the first of the two fourth-final challenges, Impact has suffered in Starfire Complex in Tukville at Seattle Raw 2:1.
The impact is attached to the seminal its powers with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Sunday, in Minnesota, Thunder raised Thunder in the home box of deficit 3:1 and finally wind 4:3, but Whitecaps were still set into a semiphinal round with a total number of gates 5:4.
The impact should be shooting with Whitecaps at the fifth and on the week, but the details of the series of challenges will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's gall
The first avoid triangle canadian is ready to start the sezon.
A unit based on Alex Kovaleva, Tomáse Pleance and Andreje Kosticina last night in the Centre Bell raised an attack to win Canadian 3:2 on the other journey.
Costicin, the biggest star, shoot the ice, the Plekanec gathered two assistents and Kovalev shot one game in this fourth wind of three-colored trips of six prepared packs.
Kovalev assured the victory that he gave him the only hair during the soldiers.
"I'm not ready yet," advised Russ.
"I need another cup to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to control it too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciates the end of the challenge.
He's got a nice shirt."
Charest is in the north
Premier does not explain that to the end of the year the pre-time options
Immediately after the assembly of Liberal Party (Liberal Party), Jean Charest was moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where in today's additional options, a new Ministry of Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Remove the middle of our last large north border," this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visual way in the conclusion of the Liberal Quebec assembly in Lewis, but he didn't share the details.
During his word, the images were forwarded behind him in some image milk.
Three rounded plots run with observed images of hydroelectric oversights, Down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media, such as in the pre-selected period.
On the print conference, the last premier refused to exclaim that he would call forward options, even though he warned that he had a very increasing program.
"The North Plan" creates the fourth "vise", which the Premier considers for Quebec, seeing a "new economic space", which includes agreement with France on work force, agreement between Canada and Europe and Ontaria.
Although the opening of the North - North Area on the 49th equality, the premier often changed in his statements, it was still not the subject of the presentation.
However, the Premier restricted that he explained why the North represents "great potential", however, the terms, the higher investment or the clear priority in the future projects.
At the same time, there were several access to points that could be further developed: particularly water electricity, less, especially significant sector, enhanced by the growth of developing countries and the renewable public infrastructures.
North, about Charest's calculation, contains "nick, shirt, shirt, platin, gold, silver, yellow, titan, and even diamants."
This is "the land two times greater than France is with us." "He's in Quebec.
And it's not only with us, but it's in us," he imagined how he wanted to show that it is allowed to be a certain national officer.
Quebec was built into a large room in relationship with the north, and he stretched up the premier: gold hobby in Abitibi, Chebeck Ingegnership, James's board.
"It's our, it's our future," he added theatrically to look at a large map behind his backs.
North, 70 per cent of the Quebec area, includes the part of the Labrador, who always required Quebec, has exceeded the premier during the print conference.
"It's about traditional positions that repeated all the appropriate governments.
There is a border line that has no longer existing a agreement, and if there is a appropriate opportunity, in the name of the Government of this position will be renewed again," he said.
Otherwise, "He has also needed to think of our visibility of the North," he reported about the transition of the north-west, which was opened in the consequence of the treatment of the aircraft.
In this new geopolitic context, the premier thinks that the fields are responsible.
And what are the citizens of the country, the original nations and the Inuties?
Premier said that the Chesbeck government will be very careful to them and that the project will be useful, especially young.
Two ex-ministers of two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Letourneau (ancient phykistical messengers from Hungary) have already started to be released with at least thirty communities.
Action started the Ministry Committee whose President Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet has a significant position (Right and Natural Resources).
Premier doesn't refer to a big meeting, "not necessarily summit," but a minute when "the common vision will be issued."
The North Development should last be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "increased, structured and smooth to the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a floor in the visibility of liberal premiers who were before him.
"It's like liberals who have been before us, we have changed our thoughts to change explanations in new opportunity for growth and development."
This was the last one of the remaining surprised weekly theme that was started with a large cocktail of the 50th year of Jean Lesage to the part of the page.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to cross the Beauharnois Center on Adelard-Godbot's overseer.
"Od Godbout, who founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who made the Clide Revolution and the reconnaissance of the water electricity, until after Bourass, who created James's attack, made our side to create future," announced Jean Charest.
On the print conference, he was called to another authority, this time concertive, and then on the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, premier in 1957 to 1963.
When a series came to Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest showed that its execution was planned for 2012.
"I'm just telling it between us, but I'm in the plan to be at this," he convinced his member's basic basis, which he called a significant ticket.
The premier who said in April, that in 2008, they would not be choices, and, immediately, not in 2009, he had not allowed the possibility to choose choices on aeroplane, which allows him the law.
However, he understood that his program was inhabited, especially the federal Council mission in China and the Qubec-New York summit.
The weekly conference offered to the leader of the platform for some nationalistic resolutions, especially the specific "sheets to change the institution" which have passed very low: PLQ (Liberal Quebec side) requires particularly the recognition of "Quebec specifications" in the Station.
It also wants to be called a part of the Canadian Council members for audits and television sentences that would have the right to vote in the case of the decision adopted in Quebec.
From the side of the obsession, the Plan North was in his main charts to accept skatetically.
Boss PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois reached the political development of the north Quebec, which Landry's government started in 2001.
According to her, when the Government of the Liberals had received power in 2003, the fulfillment of this policy was fulfilled.
If she had been achieved, "We would have gone for this day," she noted Marois on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the choices are today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said he's supporting the North Plan in the government.
"Now we're going to be not only a miracle," explained Sebastian Proulx, leader of Mary Dumont, who is now returning from the empty.
Letters - Denied country
It was Vic Toews, ex-minister of "justice" in Harper's campaign, who allowed to say about Louise Arbour that represents "hanb".
Thus, a woman who has led the unbelievable battle for righteousness and who serves all our wealth, is a lot of things about the premier around and Stephan Harper's self.
We have a government before us, which, as the only one of all of the west countries participated, has not brought back to the authority of the State partner closed in the Concentrary Box of Guantánamo.
The government that does not be in the case that in the time they had to get the actions that were taken to him, Omar Khadr was a young boyfriend.
The only government that, although the Canadian signed a female convention, deceives his word and allows you to lose in the conditions of the child soldier.
The only one who is involved in the paradise of righteousness to make a condemnation of the accused wine.
Remember that UNICEF, international Amnesty and, in particular, the Associations of Canadian lawyers have the repairs of Omara Khadra to wait for the righteous process in Canada.
The same government closes the eyes before the murder: a little matters that this young man is mentally destroyed, and it was uncertainly surprised after a few years of suffering.
We don't know that, but we're just witnesses of our rights, our freedom and our democracy, the word that Harper's so many fires and whose mouth seems so empty.
The time has come when there is no more moral: it is possible to have a Canadian citizen, wrongly coming with him, to confess it according to the leader of the leaders of the minor government (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many challengers believe that they will find a safeguard in the side that announces the Honor, the Law and the Road: they don't see that this government has been described from what the reputable and the seriousness of our country has created.
Hanba is, Mr. Toews, in this expression, and not there.
Naziers - Orwellovian diskurs of the company Barrick Gold
In the publication of 17 September, Le Devoir wrote Patrick J. Garver, the Executive Vice-President of the Canadian Department of Barrick Gold.
With the organic logic confirms that the largest manufacturer of gold in the world has started the exploitation of three authors and a poor small teaching for honor to choose "transparent public debat" and requires six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and irrespective, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of excuse for honor, but the law.
I don't surprise that Garver's this basic solution is completely disappeared.
Or is it probably for Barrick Gold the best way to take a public debat, to bring to anybody who would be able to steal the ground?
Even if the process will happen, the cars and the manufacturer of the Noir Canada books (Canada) will be able to lose the valued sums to be prepared to be prepared to fight a very unrealised battle with the army of lawyers supported nearly with unreasonable companies.
The tactics in these non-equality challenges are most often expected to collect the requested for the purposes of requesting a threatened management, which ensures the mouth of the contrast, and also be grateful to anyone who would refuse to take this thing.
If the company Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to look at the whole thing to imagine a public debt.
In contrast with what happens in some countries where Barrick Gold is in Canada, the debates of normal circumstances in the change of the thoughts, and nothing in the morning.
The companies were therefore not sufficient to open their books, documentation, and to make a real debate through news, media, publication and financing independent scientific teams that could enter into the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold, seems to have no confidence in public ministry, and with a smoke he refuses requests and letters to support the authors of the Noir Canada books.
Maybe Garver could explain how to ask the "public debat" and even the opinions of publicity?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President world is not just fully placed lawyers, and not all the Canadians; it is enough to eat this eating.
In the democracy, they have the right to speak to the Nativers.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or doesn't want to understand - that publicity that supports the authors and the manufacturers of Noir Canada is doing this in particular because he refuses brutal forms of worthy company.
The publicity is ready to hear and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, not in the framework of what many take as a smoking, where they have to be inquired of the mouth (in the framework of their "public debates" company Barrick just gave the official investigation to the authors Noir Canada to publish officially that they have to stop using this term...).
If we go out of the surreal Garver's demonstration, the initiatived Barrick Gold is directly attacking the universal freedom of paying and searching for truths that are essential for each democratic company.
The whole right to citate confidential resources and the debate on facts and interpretations that constitute themselves the basis of intellectual activities.
If it's in the land, like Canada, it's impossible to study and discuss themes that don't like the rich companies of this world, and we're not going to make a recovered smoking, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she had been guided by scientist standards using the cars of Noir Canada.
He's right to answer.
The Universal Environment for which we are to be able to address debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excuse clearly shows that, in addition to what he says, there is no less disappointment to take a transparency.
For the Universal World, it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would be limited to such a type of unrighteous exhaustion.
Wall Street Safety Operation - Democratic and Republicans understand
The Bush's Administrative and Translators of the Congress, such as the Republic, and the Democracy, finally, have contributed to the agreement on the most saved economic plan from a great crisis of thirty years.
The new version of the plan, as using 700 billion dollars of American dollars to break the financial crisis that has already been cloomed by the Wall Street, must be yet approved by both comors of the Congress.
In particular, it is proposed: better control of the elected employees on its application, new mechanisms to ensure the replacement of public money, new measures to ensure the number of houses inhabited because of non-proliferation, and also the right to follow the highest cities of the leading employees saved by fires.
The American Financial Ministry of Henry Paulson, President of Snimovs representatives Nancy Pelosi and representative of the Republicans at the one table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good new yesterday several minutes after the end of the two-year-old maraton.
"We have done great progress, and we have grown into the agreement that will be effective on the markets," announced the representative of Busho's Administrative, Henry Paulson.
"All was done so that real economy and rural Americans would be safe before the crisis just running on Wall Street," explained the democracy.
"This is a fundamental point: if we don't do that, the trauma, the chaos and the destruction of each day of the American life will be great," announced the Republic of Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, the exhibition was deployed to the maximum turns from fear of the effect that would have been further mistakes to the investors' disposal.
The time limit was opening markets this morning.
Both candidates on the American President were invited to declare later, and both were expressed at least for the agreement, but they did not forget to express their disagreement with the need to be taken into such national solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama adopted the completion of the agreement on some measures, in particular the purpose of allowing holders to maintain the residence, and measures on the middle of the employment State to be saved by the saved firms.
"When we are requesting the candidates to take special measures for the unreasonable responsibility of some people, it is not for what to welcome.
However, these measures are needed," he explained on foreign televisions.
John McCain, who was asked for another station, would he vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes."
"Blue characters I read, [we show] that it's about something that we all have to treat and through what it's possible to continue.
Choose an inactivity is shortly unacceptable," he said.
The target of 700 billion plan is to be sold for the money of the funders of serious reviews and risks and non-provided activity of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis declined by the exploitation of bubbles on the market of disabilities which first led to avoid risks of hypothesis credits (subprimes), then moved to further, wideer forms of credits (PCAA) and was exposed in the destruction of preparation and banks and financial institutions.
The event of the first proposal of the Agreement from the past week have an agreement on the Republican messengers.
Since the democratics arrived at the fact that, for some "toxic" activity of companies who have difficulties, the government will only handle it, but it does not sell it, he believes that the unoriented situation is blessed.
As a result of the contradiction opinions in the Congress, the Government will be able to carry up new plans that would help her to reach its income if the programme has to overcome losses for five years.
The new plan calculates the first part of 250 billion, which will be able to add more than 100 billion billion, if the President is considered necessary.
In addition to 350 billion others, the Congress should apply in a new vote.
The exchange for its help of Washington will get parts in saved companies that will spread the divisions in the case of the ship, and that will be able to sell again until it's all.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to reduce the procedures of reduction of the possibilities related to the shipping plan, as well as to establish limits for higher evaluation and exchanged leaderships.
The guards of the plan would like to make her vote in the Representatives today and in the Middle-Senat.
Instead of all the efforts based, it is not yet sure whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, the votes of the project were still raised in the Republic and in the democratic campaign.
"It's obviously clear that Washington doesn't hear you," reported on the address of the audits of the Republic of Scott Garrett, the Financial Commission of Snimovny.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it is not a solution to make sure on the planners."
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the representative of the Congress Group transmitted "the choice of Skeptics" represents the whole thing, but it is the same conclusion.
"Firty hundred employed economy professors, among them three Nobel prices, wrote to us: we have to ask the Congres that he may not be quickly quick and noticed the way to go out," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, this crisis is a crisis of the world.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three countries of Benelux had announced the party recognition of the Fortis Bank Group for 11,2 billion eur (16,3 billion USD).
The Intervention of the Government of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was required after the French bank of Paribas announced that it departs from the purchase of its concurrency, which is to continue to delay from 2 billion € (2,9 billion €) from the consequence of risk credits on the purchase of inability in the United States.
Fortis is 85,000 people, are between 20 largest European banks and ten larger assessors.
"We don't come on this money," he announced the Netherlands Ministry of Wouter Bos.
"We get a choice right in the bank and influence.
And that's just the officers and households in the latest time of today."
On the other hand of the La Manche channel, it seems that the British government began to recognize other banks set in financial crisis.
According to English press, the Government had to overcome all remaining credits of the Bradford and Bringley banks, of which more than 41 billion (75,5 billion USD) had been established to buy inability.
According to his last announcement, Santander's British bank clients and accounts of Santander's Spanish bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must be born from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of society attributed icons
His beauty with the eye of acetic eye showed his thronf, according to other weakness.
Did this American heritage be broken with a narcistic smiling?
Yeah, no.
The entirety, civility, and the uncomfortable talent that had been his own, also removed it from the strong category that plants real stars.
But how long it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years in his morning in Connectictu in the result of the fish rack and remains one of the last age of American chinematography.
Nearly bigger than Brando, who was like and long, was some of his rivals on the film, Newman was a more careful hero, since I crowd, but also the apostle of freedom and the threat of dramatic conventions.
The smoking blood often plants beautiful children.
He was born in Ohiu in 1925, his father was German Jewish and mother of the origin of Hungary.
These European roots were born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No eggs, which is the last character quality.
Because in it all this country was looked favorable to self made mana, a fighter in the Pacific war, who was in the beginning of 50 years studyed heritage in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and served triumph in divadle, in the TV and in the film.
The man who was fighting for the citizen law was also a car driver who was raised up as the second at the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, and even since 1958 he created a couple of models with the heritage Joanne Woodward.
He also goes out the stream of this hidden, discretive, socially attached stars, allergically on the use of its own show-business, which will always remain in a certain way.
A gentle man, in the most exciting word of meaning.
The department of Paul Newman this week has made it to turn the favorites of the movie, while his great role supports the black plot reminders.
After it, it defiles more than half century, in the end of the transforming of the seventh art of America.
In memory, a young man who rejects his significant wife (Elizabeth Tayloro) in the Coffee on the burned shoes, adaptation Tennessee of Williamse from 1958.
From less old (1990), we save his mysterious Lord Bridge, who was renewed in the advanced marriage, which has not completed all expectations.
A lot of the other Paul Newmans came to the story.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, disappointed, violent, unforgettable delicvent from somebody Up There Likes Me (In the signs of hate) Robert Wise, a role defined for Jamese Deana, overseased after his death, which introduced in 1956 Newman in real knowledge.
Sympatic gangster in the most beautiful The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
A horrible and comfortable ball player in the fantasy The Hustler Robert Rossena (1961), which is also established in The Color of Money Martin Scorse, which will be given him in 1987 by the only Oscar with seven nominations.
It's the face of the age, it's him.
And he's again.
In his professional route, he will support various episodes.
Youngs know her first thanks to the cultural Shot Shot George Roye Hilla (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlopa, a nontraditional hoke trainer.
Fanoušers met him again in The Hudsucker Proxy in the Brothers of Coen in 1994.
Then his carrier closed the role of Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sama Mendes in 2003.
At the difference of several film legends that were at least left the rhyme, Newman remained in a long branch, he must have disappointed Hollywood with his posts, proofs and steps.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, even without humor, thought "for living call underplaying," judged that in his conclusions he pressed too much on the pile.
For the beauty of Paul Newman, whose role was coming as a shipment, the professor was not always so worthy.
However, the first lovers played less often than foreigners: neurotics, alcohols, smokes and smokes, whose abuses and refugees were reflected in its perfect risks.
As a governor Newman rejected a lot of known pages of his courageous citizenship.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (in the role of Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward, gives a civilian woman's portrait full of melancholie.
His son, Scott, who lost his son because of the transmission, wind in 1984 the film Harry and Son, full study and suffering.
In the accommodation of newman, his big friend and an old partner Robert Redford (the Sting and the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), he declared a lot: "He has made my life and this land better."
Majesty, love for life, these are the main property of the dead herd.
If we take his legal carrier, a great fighter is also gone for civil rights, ecoology, an independent film, a reduction of Hollywood's accident.
His similitude we were usually seeing on the skins of wine oxygen, shoes, shoes, and other foods, which could be very unexpected, although the beginning of the gag was done.
Nevertheless, the chips from the sale went to his Account for a hard childhood.
Newman was so, at least before he had left his glory, he was angry in the company for the last time.
His five daughters left a letter that contains these ages: "Your father has always been grateful to his happy planet.
I felt that I could be here."
And it was honorable for us to watch the way of life so clear and great American artists.
And otherwise, the end of the end, the parent.
What happened in the company on the Functioning & Counsel?
In addition, 8 October, the treatment begins in a criminal management leading against Janus Zuskatt and his companies.
Policies and society are excluded by other criminal acts, including cutting letters, accused by the duration of the long-term and systematically criminal organization, which had been caused to be extremely significant.
According to the procurements, the money in public concurrences used for their own objectives and the implementation of the tasks often raised efficient factors.
The money from State and samosrechts - at the front of about 65 million forensics - were putting part in the office of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, part of the single caps.
The procedure in which he also informed the investigatory officer, considered that the money received in public costs were chosen on the basis of factors which were not actually contradicted and accepted the commitments of the society were never reached.
A large part of the factor would be false.
The pressures to these factors have come from the joysefwater market, the cool ratio was produced in Kiskunhalas.
On the names of which the company has to carry out the factory, it was decided to be otherwise on the road to the north side of Balaton, on which Stavent Ladose Janos Zuskat sent.
According to his explanations, he was first named to look at the pensions and restaurants.
In them, he requested accounts for his consumption, in accordance with which the forms were then produced in the framework of public contingencies under other young Ministers and Sports, the Ministry of Works and Social things, the respective Samos Justice of the main city.
The facts made the majority of Staven Lados with his company Andras Torrim, which wrote most partly the news to get subventions.
At his "Study Road" Lados looked at one pig.
According to the two factors provided by the Agreement and its companies in 2003, this poosing equipment was ensuring for the 19-year-old group of Viltos Pont.
Many people would, however, have not come into this device according to the proposal of the leadership.
In the same way, the formal and content errors made in 2002 were replaced with the name of Job Further, after Contribution and Harmadik Evezred.
Pension in Badacsonytomaia was only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, although it was mentioned at the fact that one hundred thirty hosts were mentioned.
However, the fulfillment of the pressures with the rich fantasy have been replaced as well as when they carried out the evidence of the companies of such a famousness - Pigal e.g., in which accounts were not defined according to the information provided for by the State legislation of documents referred to in the name of Job Ivoire and Hoppa.
The Leading Company The Guide Farkas for hvg.h showed that when they invited him to procurture and showed him factors, he immediately knew he was about false documents.
"The name of our company and our money numbers were on a road on a bad place."
As he added, except formals did not agree that, according to the factors of 100 people, they have only 11 rooms that have no so great capacity.
Furthermore, it was also mentioned in the fact that their restaurants had no longer function.
The horly producers of the factor did not pronounce that the viewed Budapsh Road Office organizes only foreign paths, and in the factor with the payment in the preparation, which was not agreed with the factory practices, they brought a post as a service to mediate the travels to Hungary.
Furthermore, as the investigation processed, they also carried into the DPH document, the road to the country outside the European Union was invited by the DPH.
In four documents established by Jobb For the Future of the Hotel Revfülöp and. o. has not agreed to others or higher DPH. In the activities of the company, there is no 25 per cent, but 15 per cent of the DPH, except for which the employer of the hotel was established by the only printed factors, but the manufacturer was written.
In addition, the "providers" factor must be made in one company as a view to the investigation of the State Department, as the implemented activity of the manufacturer of goods, which was not implemented by the investment advice.
It is that the factures of the posts provided by Unit and Harmadik Evezred and the companions of XXI. Szadi Cultural Unit and Biztos Pont was false, except for formal deficits - an incompatible format of factors and wrong ratio.
As in the case of Ravenna's company, or the Sport campaign in Kunfehlon, which the representatives claimed that they would make factures.
For example, the passengers didn't even realize that the HIB company of Niiregyhazi was in the period (2001) when a group of the Fiatal Város had been broken in liquidation, therefore, in accordance with our information of the liquidity Commissioner, the company also declared that he would give him a paper.
Factors made science.
The second group of factors creates those who knew that they had to make a efficient factor.
Esily Budapest has made four million forensics for Harmadik Evezred for the request of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal - Ejú Socialists.
Collab's leadership at the r. o. took place in accordance with the requirements to provide a fixed account one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
With the Assembly and its companies, Biogate was also collaborated, at the moment in the liquidation which was applied in 2003 for the Jobb Future and Atlas and the Foreign Factors in the value of five million forensics, which had not been real economic activity.
Not the movement of money, because the creation of the factures were recorded later, however, the organization has forgotten to enter in their documents.
The other groups of factors are those who had the requirements to be required.
Ivan Kubatov, for example, was a trusted representative of the Ukrainian Uniter of Delta Trio, with the business with steadfasts and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, where the company is not to find.
The company established in October, November and 2005 a few factors for the sales of calculation techniques in approximately 18 million forensics.
According to the data founded in the investigation, the facts of the Cash Investment, Cash, which was from 14 September 2005 in liquidation.
The company of this company was a man from Romania who had to submit letters relating to the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov in the investigation recognized that in the name of the company gave factors to the companies Atlas, Hoppa and the positions of Unit and Harmadik Evezred and accepted their contradiction.
In addition to Ivan Kubat's request, the Romanian meetings were based on Fa-Bani Jos Fapari and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, there was no one of the fires, according to the requested reason that they had no work.
However, the companies were to help him, for the request of the co-operated lawyer of the Holy One, who also prepared their based lists, made the name of the Fire of the Factors for Atlas and Y-generation in the Treaty.
The name of the fire investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov's entire 15 factors in the value of 14,2 million forensics.
The State detention stated that Kubatov has come to 10% of the parts of the factors and DPH.
In order to establish fishing factors, this time to the election management for Victus Pont, the man also used the Szi-Beri company to. t.
Y-generation and Conference and Proposal for Modern Hungary, in January 2006, proposals were offered to the public conference of Nadace Mihalye Tancsicsse (TMA), publicly useful socialist parties.
It was obtained after 500 thousand forensics, however, the amounts were not based on the objectives referred to in the proposals.
In order to not show it, the TMA has submitted five fixed factors from the Works Team.
These facts were recently found in a home visitor in the office of the Armaged Kemecsei in the Ministry of School.
During the treatment of a part of the required, it may probably describe the process of the production of factors as it has already been done on the procurator.
Interesting may be likely if everything is decided to separate himself the main required John's Assembly.
His proper explanation is not too detailed, and although he had promised that all things were explicitly expressed, he did not yet.
The question is whether it's in his interest - an exchange for a large part of the accident, fifty million forensics, maybe socialists have concluded the agreement and Zusi takes it on themselves.
He could even lose, because his request was not listed to the condition of his holding, whereas the place in the prison was not listed.
While the creatives of economic criminal acts who have made a lot of greater disagreements that have still not been disagreed, they may be freely walked or at least waiting for the end of their ruling in their households, he does not have this possibility.
Psychology: Why do we lose more money?
In the shoes, the lawyers want to lose more money, exceed the rewards.
Neurological and economic bases of this known - and increasingly irrational - the conduct had been made to decline researchers from the Neurology and Economy of New York University.
According to their studies, published in the Science magazine, people don't want to stay with the eBay type of aurice, so they're more pleased to pay too much high price.
Research, using experimental auction, tried to map this "game" scheme in nervous relationship.
One group of employees was raised, the second group was participated with the played aucs, including the method of manufacturer magnetic resonance (fMRI) study the active area of the brain of tested persons.
In both games, the participants could win money, however, at the game of august, which the important element is to destroy the second side, began to work intensively under the brain, named stritim.
This brain area plays except many other functions in the "see-change" nervous system mechanism.
The exchange of prices is therefore able to explain that, according to the investigators, it is possible to try to exceed the excessive reaction of the streat.
In order to ensure their theories, the members of the research team have been carried out of a series of financial transparency monitoring.
In the case of different conditions, there were three groups against one partner.
The control group was just communicated, which is the real value of the product given, and they made the rates.
Other groups were also promised that if they go out of the game, they will be rewarded for $15 more.
The third group has received 15 dollars, even before the railway, however, in the case of the transition, her members and these money came.
The differences between both groups were therefore compatible with all that one had been reached and the other progress.
However, the members of the playing "profit" were wished to go higher than that was in the control and "wind" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologs.
"This results cannot be carried out from no existing economic theory before.
You still explained the ices observable in the wind - and risks of joys.
As the neurologic view methods helped us to resolve the difference between these two teories so that we now have grown up to the third statement," stated Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economic Faculty of New York University.
Hepatitis: When do you look for a doctor?
Nearly half billions of people in the world do the chronic infection of hepatitis B or C, then this chronic disease is introduced in Hungary between the principal causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis is declined to a hundred thousand, however, only seven thousand of them are treated. It is the reason that hospitals often do not know that they are carrying.
The name of the hepatitis is a combined name of the infectious infections of jaters produced by various viruses.
In their symptoms there is a lot of similarity, it is significant to buy jater and yellow, however the origin of the disease and their disease is different from themselves.
Hepatitis viruses are due to the original disease two main ways: hepatitis of type A and E treatment (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood virus and body technology (sperma, sexy secret, slides).
In each case, the residents should be protected by expectations against virus A and B, against type C vaccin.
The hepatitis A marks are found two to three weeks after the use of infected food, usually are carried out of illegality, difficulties, low difficulties to return.
Then on hairs and eyes are creating yellow, light thrones, and dark power. The medicine can keep two to three weeks.
Every year million people will die in the whole world at the serious kind of disease, on the rack of jater and the age cirurgic caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to the disagreements, only every decade of medicine treatment is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can be carried up to the jater circle or race jater.
Most of their diseases don't know, the origin of the disease has a raw cell, and then the first signs will be made in many cases until 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important for the time prevention, the implementation of a regulatory descriptor.
In three groups, this disease is more frequenter than in average: among people who sold blood transfusions, between drug users and people with tattoo.
In the present time, the global number of units of chronic hepatitis C 200 million.
Since the disease may have already shown rutin laboratory investigation, a man should be indicated that any advantage of unknown origin should be returned to his practical doctor.
In the time disappearance, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, and to prevent so suspiciousness and to prevent the relationship of the smoking.
30 September is the world's day of hepatitis, which was organized in the first world in 2004.
His goal is to warn the chronic jater's clothing caused by these virus, for the cause of his relationship, and to the meaning of the time recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God is so painful?
According to the results of the recent investigation, faith in God works as a certain analgetic, which could reduce death to already Catholic muscles.
The scientists of Oxford University have made an interesting experiment, studied how a person affects faith in the god of pain, reported the British Telegraph journal.
In the framework of the bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic faithers and the same number of ateists were made for electric shocks, while all observed a little displaying Mrs. Maria.
According to the results, the Catholic faithful capabilities were a large part of pain to exclude.
The technology that detailed the human brain showed that Catholics had able to activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for the rule of pain.
The study is the first of the series of advice that are involved in academys and scientists, philosophy and theologists of various parts of the university.
It was completely tested so that to the left hand of the trial subject, they applied the safe tool that gave electric shocks.
Researchers asked the participants of the trial to observe twice: Mrs. Sassoferrato Marii from the 17th century and Dama with the border of Leonard da Vinci, designed in the 15th century.
The automobiles of the research hoped that Mrs. Marii would call a certain state of godliness in the faithful, while Vinci's image was chosen because it was too different from the first, and it was able to make a relaxing house.
The test companies have trained half hours in MRI scenery and during this period, in four following parts of 20 electronics, while separately watched pictures with religious or common subjects.
The Catholics realized that when Mrs. Mary looked, they felt "in security" as they were "populated" and "called, he filled them with peace."
When they looked at the image with religious issues, they felt about 12 percent less of pain than when Leonard had the work before themselves.
Psycholog Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that such effects can be achieved by any strongly popular image and attheists, is only to find a correct photo.
"We should find a picture that will mean very positively, from the position of the mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English biscub Tom Wright achieved the results of the research.
"First practice should be changed and in many cases also change our personality," added Wright.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect would be on the regulation of the faithful pain if they had shown to them some madon from Leonard or a little similar calibri.
Would he mean the view of Mrs. Marie's quality to get better results?
You're what you're doing from yourself.
About their tenth birthdays, Google can announce that people can find him in their box at least as well as on the sky above his head; they know where they were allowed, in what kind of research and what it's interesting.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the leaders of the company, but it's not yet enough.
In particular, in the case of boxes made parallel with an orwellovic dark vision, they are not clearly self-based on 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed for the Financial Times journal that the main googla objective is to gather on users more personal data, which is necessary to keep Googlu's original objective, which said, "Let us all the information on the world!"
According to the corresponding representative of Googla, the companies and the 10 years of the worldwide work first to work with all information.
At what's going on five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer the type "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What work would I really have to do for me?" - for such simple questions, but the software will not know the answer until they know about the users of information.
Not all users of the Internet well know that during the Internet search are exactly intended to search words and what IP addresses have been searched and on which pages the interesters have been moved after searching.
Thanks to the service Personalized Search started two years ago, users can, for example, keep his history of their surface, they can look back on what they searched and click, thanks to what they then generated in long-term perspective findings more applied to them - on the same logic will also be based on the service of Recommendations, through which the system will be based on the based on the previous and maintained preferences to carry products and services.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm worried?
In most cases, the potential powers of the representative company are increasingly achieved, the antireaction does not release in the users of the Internet awareness of sin, fear of suffering, freedom or even rebellion against power.
In particular, it is confirmed that all searching expressions are not only achieved, but, in the cases concerned, the third party may also be given, in such legal cases, the personality rights of the users of the Internet will not be played.
The most known example of the last time was likely coordinated actions against the Brazilian Pedofiles, which gave Google the Brazilian Government information that allowed the identification of pedofiles from the Community site of Orkut, which were cut off through its.
The Internet users who fear personal rights, however, could still decline in May when the companies with the organization for the protection of the EFF rights successfully proved their truth in the FFF: Google should not be even in the future any item of discipline to provide any information required by the FBI secretly.
(In the same time, the federal government has successfully chosen at least fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searched expressions that have received a revoking for a year before the child's approved law, although it was not able to obtain lists of individual users, respectively the full list of web pages and key words that limit two months.)
Google Nazier is so distracted: it is struggled to those who fear the offer of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate challenge and private life will start using Googlu, newly designed, and expose against it with a revolution, which is an international company with concert image.
And then the American geek culture and its divine relationship, which grouped around himself higher computer fans, activities and users, appearing in many countries, seeing a new generation of greater, "corporation, which is now cold," in the differences of his Microsoft, considered by Windows for the world, as both fighting for the same purpose.
This may be caused by that Google in different ways from Microsoft does not require its users' identification code and does not want money for their application; open, free, untailly clean source of information and the package of programs makes a lot of available, younger, "cool" than the official software work.
However, it can also be caused to understand the geeks exactly the very difficult relationship with the Internet and personal rights that have been brought to them just one of the most closed key words of the last years: web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is not about nothing other than cooperation, that we leave the pieces and use the communication channels we have available, and even though it's their range in each other, the basic is the same: we show.
A average young man can take a profile immediately on a few communities pages from Facebook to Xanga, which can be quietly connected with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, or application last.fm, which is called the music listed, all then can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, except in which you can write a blog, which will automatically discover its most largest photographers, which are attached to Frulick and Pibbes.
Then we can learn about a lot of exemplary cases from which he explains: a friend's friend's on the morning in view of the photograph of the joint friends is easy to come to the one with whom her famous friend traveled evening, or the company can only exhaust his worker because his blog is considering his right detail on the top direction: one of the particular life has been completed today.
The one who lives online life is based on what he will show from himself, so we can define the basic teas hidden for the behaviour of the younger today.
And whoever wants to shoot or get out of the Googla monopol, has the possibility (initial Scogle, which uses the search system of Googla, however, does not explicitly leave the tracks).
The small number of people, for instance, does not approve the Community pages to find them. Online Googla application from the text editor by photoeditor and the reporting portal is possible to change for alternative versions that are not connected to the server parks and which of us does not make the best possible profile.
The public ministry does not expect the enemy secretly when Google shows powers.
The business is with its current value of $156 billion larger than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the insert areas AdWords/AdSens increase in investments of reklame agents and services which are still increasingly able to reduce life not only to Microsoft but also to read other software designers.
However, the critical observers also include the contrasts of the employees to be rejected by the extent: the above leadership, for example, rejected the protests of the employees after having been carried out on a double-tail of payment for the business school, voluntaryly often the day of disagreement of the employees, had been a lot of cost, however, as a result of the loss of Google in 2006, was declined before the billion of government and in their mind, all of the employees who were achieved in the summary of the review of the reviews.
One of the internal rules of the company feels that it never initiates new services before, since it is already possible, it is, however, that the expected problems of the following months and years can be able to cut down the world on new places: some think that the Googlu project has been subjected to scanning and archiving books and magazines that the company will be able to achieve and the United States most sustainable, the other party of its Hethalth system in which we can be fully considered the property of the original and the problems.
The fact that Google creates a genetic database, then you can serve as a good standard material and for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the glorious news of the Cory Doctor "Scroogled" describes with organic restrictions in which a person can be very closed only by the Googlu data.
The double killer from the Ozdo helped to remove the steps of two young people
Two young people listed to the police in case of duplicate murders in the Ocean, in accordance with the reasonable suspicion, helped to remove the feet of this crime, he said in an arrogant speaker of the Police Director of Borsod.
Persons are convinced to the activities of which they were understood, and now are accused of helping a criminal action.
Both young people, according to the MTI information of two girls, are moved to freedom.
Aid to a criminal act is punished by freedom for a period of 5 years.
The surprised of a double murder in Ozdo, a 23-year-year-old man, was on week-day to take a periodic design.

Human Sobolewski, Chairman of Warshaw's price Paper, confirmed the offer that he made the Poland side, although the Chess Warshaw's bars from the cluster of the possible new properties of the bowls have already been exposed.

Financial crisis in view of the European Letters
In their outside comments, the international financial crisis is already mentioned by the previous European lists, "second 11 September".
For the global financial katastrophy, we can thank the President of the United States, which increases the offence of the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to switch his own side on the support of the law quickly applied to the law, which is the target of this sustainable situation....
In place of the New Pearl Harbor, which reminded a billioner and invester Warren Buffett, we could even talk about the second September 11.
The same part of the Madrid print is seeing the wine in Washington.
According to the opinion of the Deputy El Mundo, the world's economy has brought to continue to deploy the political leadership.
The dangers of exploitation of the American Financial System are not constantly growing, for the end of the world will pay the world.
But after voting in the Congress, Bush's plan has not yet been perfect, however, it is a terrible danger that Washington does not provide the political tool to resolve the crisis.
The world economy leads in air - just in the moment when one of the largest changes in capitalism history.
It can't be able to stop, shows the woman's journal days-Anzeiger.
One Member State can still be able to achieve the back-up of money rates of a safe crown and the payment of payers can be saved before the crawl.
Of course, if we are gathered as the coats of the master, there will be no more banks, then they will no longer have money, nor any other empowerment.
In long-term perspective, the Member States of the European Union must be transferred through their national egoism and joined controls on the broken financial markets.
Only on the lunch, more than 100 billion billion euros have received money billion, reminds the Vivienian Der Standard, in which they are afraid that as the Americans, the crisis need to take deeply into the caps and the European poverty money, still more real.
The European Union is a crisis, which is like the customs of an old continent, until it is not serious.
"Protects" should not immediately have billions of euros, however, it would be good if they would be determined in what case it is able to achieve the money of payment payers to be more fair.
Intelligent car is an imitation of years of smoking
What would like to be the best method of development of technologies that are able to refuse the trailer, if the imitation of the detailed detailed transactions in the world of nature?
For example, at the evening.
The standard strategic thinking of the surprising project, represented by the Japanese CEATEC winter, entered ingegners from Nissan's inner company. It was about how to set up new generations of systems of robbery.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan constructed the biomimetic robot management system of type BR23C, the robotized mini-miniaty which was built by the properties, with the final target of helping the creation of the system, which can eliminate all disorders.
"In the air, each room creates its own personal space of white faces that really likes our safety range," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the general director of the PR and the research and emissions.
The important role plays the eye based, which allows you to see in all directions in several aspects of more than 300 grades.
To copy the raw eye function, the ingegners ran after the idea of the laser duration.
This identification of transactions in distance to 2 metres before BR23C in a low range of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a ball microprocessor, which moves immediately into the operation that is directly to defeat.
The shipment is locked during the fourth degree, then the robotized car begins to imit the movements of the hair and the rotation of the cold in the area required to save the smoke immediately changes the direction.
In the absence of any existing system, this exciting manifest is a very instinctive way.
"If it wasn't, the robot car would not have been reacted too quickly to get out," explains Tossijuki Ando, leader of the Laboratory Mobility and the project of the robot car.
It must react instinctly and immediately, because this technology enhances the most vulnerable and internal level of security protection, inside which the smoke is considered unrealisable.
The whole process must reflect what she's doing to get out of another school.
This process can't stay longer than the smoking of the eye.
However, in the difference from the evening, this move cannot be directed up, bottom, or deeply, can only be double-dimensional and only in the direction that can turn the round.
In place of independent opportunities offering in the shopping, the robot car was only applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer acumulators that are easier and have higher energy hust, which means that they have more life than lithium-iont variables.
According to Andoa, it is an important instinct, intelligent reaction, no capacity of processing, less than data storage.
This mechanism must be processed and reacted only on several foreign signals for the second.
It is not necessary to keep them and react through intuitive logic based on data from the previous manufacturers, therefore it is not always used only memory for the size of a few kilobytes.
You don't need memory with giga or Megabyte capacity.
It is one of the first steps to evolve the technology to the immediate exhaustion that would be able to get into serious cars for ten years.
Another application may provide connection units with the satellite GPS navigation system, which would bring motorism to the specified final target after being exited.
The crazy kid has a name already.
The Economic Safety Law of 700 billion dollars to be divided in several payments and the objective of which the bank's sale of non-quality credits is already written.
The half of the parts will be used in the first row.
After other treatments, which ended until the Sunday after the north of the East America, the representatives of the Congress have contributed to the agreement in several days that continued debatting on the safe package in total 700 billion dollars, shared the agent Reuters.
"We have received a significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the Snimov Representatives, according to which only the agreement is retained.
The compromes to the package also supported both President candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Financial Ministry of Henry Paulson reported the result of the compromise: "The program will work and will be effective, but it is necessary to take further steps."
The letter like of the package was published before opening Asian markets on week 8 hours at the evening of Washington's time (which on Monday in two hours in the Middle-European morning), however, no special approach to the bars did not apply.
On the proposal of the legal standards listening on the law on the noise of economic stabilization from 2008, the programme to be established will vote first before Snimovna representatives, and then the section will be on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosia on the Sunday, afterwards, the Agreement reports also arrived in White House.
"Besides the progress that was made in the night, we are satisfied and are very valuable for both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protection of our economy," announced the White House of Tony Fratto.
The programme is other than the original proposal of Busho's Administrators, in which it has to go to the purchase of non-quality price papers insured hypotheses was funded immediately 700 billion dollars.
Now it is possible to lose at first half of 700 billion, and so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the expectation of things in the Monday of the Congress, and the Minister's Finance for them will buy price papers safeguarded hypotheses, which are assessed as non-quality, remaining 100 billion dollars, then the President will be concluded to the decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation, which will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The purchasement of the second half of 700 billion dollars will be taken into account the next decision of the Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may, in the meaning of the law, apply a combined tactics: it can currently purchase non-quality credits, hypotheses and price papers ensured by hypothesis, respectively other "unified" credits.
The debt may be carried out in the framework of the accommodation and directly shared the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The right standard of the companies to participate in the ensuring programme in which the Ministry of Finance provides a guarantee for the reasons for concern, and the company shall pay the price of the higher expected challenges.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides required measures to fulfil the requirements of the US financial system to be based to 700 billion dollars, that it will be already raised to the increased purchase of bad funds, their ensure or protection of the system risk associated with some of the large money equipment.
"We will make the necessary steps to be ready to take the law once it is signed," added.
Boss banks that have been in trouble and waiting for the State’s help can even be counted by the government reducing a distance, which says easierly "the gold pad".
In order to restrict their payment only in certain cases, these restrictions will also be able to ensure that the Ministry provides assistance.
The restrictions, based on, means that, if the Ministry is buying in the framework of the Authentication, will be able to cut out the golden debts, if the bank directors are not able to be sent up equally to the reach.
In the case of a right refund of non-valuable credits, the Government will be aggressively attached to the interest that the money for guidance should not be exceeded.
It is essential to add that the existing agreements on gold falls are not changed, the restrictions are only for new contracts, which must be further aim to participate in the programme.
"It's the first case in the history of America when the legal limits of the general directors will be fulfilled," commented the President of the Committee on Financial Services, the Democratic Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State of participating banks shall be the right to achieve the party, which reduces the risk of payment funders, because when economic and saved banks are established on the feet, they can be made on this transaction and make it.
The proposal contains that in the next five years the President must submit the proposal to the Congress on how to return to the payment funders expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, on both sides there were also votes expressed in relation to the idea plan.
"American citizens didn't give us this, this is the dollar of the donors of donation, not saving," announced the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Captur judges that those who are responsible for Wall Street's defense are exactly obtained.

Transparency of German language areas
Practice campaign is unbelievable, only the choices inside it became the most self-conscious - so analyzes the low CSU results in the Bavorscu Der Spigel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule the Rakous to save the rode and black coal.
The speed (splay.de)
In the Internet issue of the German German report magazine, Franz Walter is described in his article named "Bavors Revolution will use his father" the dramatic causes of CSU.
According to the known policy, the CSU has already started a lot of time before his office has overcome the suffering du Beckstein-Huber.
The Christian socialists renewed Bavorka all the decades, and now they turn away from them.
The setting of time is therefore the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and also the Angely Merkel.
Debacol was not fully surprised for CSU, however, in the Sabbath, the process was able to prevent at about 10 years: the insufficient hegemonie of one State.
10 years ago, in 1998, CSU was added to 47,7 per cent, first of 50 years under 50 per cent.
This has been repeated three years ago by choices to Bundestage in 2005, so it is still at the same time that Stoibero was mentioned.
The reason is the modernization of the CSU in this country and the use of its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but in time they have been very confused. Secularization, education results, training of Germany from east and north in the Bavorska regions, however, could not be without results on the faithfulness of the CSU volunteers.
Modernism is linked to the growth of the possibility, which has also its visible political consequences.
Practice campaign is unbelievable, but only the volunteers inside him became the most self-conscious, critical, selfisher.
It is also obvious that the CSU has been the most degree of classic citizen levels in the past weeks; people in free vocation, foods, ones with maturity and high school education.
The CSU support has already been scanning under 40%.
The Press (depresse.com)
The Concert Journal of Vienna is in his article named "Who with whom? The President's parties are in questions of coaly holders" brings the ransom intropolitic situations in the consequence of race choices.
SPÖ's going to handle the OVP.
OVP shall ensure SPE to its internal issues.
SPECIAL is as open to all the treatment, the defence doesn't want to take care of the coal.
The choices are behind us, now all are going around the coalyce; in the debt of the public TV, the President's parties were not allowed to look at their cart.
The President of the SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed that he's going to act with the OVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that both parties cooperation may be certain - in some society countries and in social partnership exists.
The question, whether the coal and Wilhelm Moltrer, the current President of the OVP, as a vice-cancer, left Faymann open.
Just as he said, the Kurs Schüssel-Moltiger was cut down on every fall.
Repeating this Directive is not in consideration.
Moltiger reacted carefully on the red menus.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann is trying to take into the internal issues of the APP.
If his side chooses the opposition or enters into the coalyce, it is still open on the side, these questions must be decided in the EVP.
The President of Jörg Haider was opened again in all directions.
"We're ready to take the government's responsibility to save the red-new coal," he said.
Jarking: It is needed to prolomit the loaded rock of poverty and seregation
In Paris, the European Equality summary of France, the current President of the European Union, has started today.
Livia Jarok, the missionary of the European People's Party for Fidez, as one of the main words of the primary age in his message addressed scheme, turned attention to the secretariat in school, because it is one of the most important unjustness of Rome's children, and also the most serious overseer of their implementation.
The Conference started - the name of the French President - Xavier Bertrand, French Ministry of Work and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spider, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
In order to earn, they have been sitting between the invited Governments, European social partners, the most important European organizations for the protection of the rights and citizens in the areas of equal opportunities.
According to the print officers of the Europolian group, Fidesz Jarok warned that, under discrimination in the Congregation of Working Force, the Romans are exhausted from the European working forces in particular by their lower education.
"The majority of the young Romans have no central education and, consequently, the bad base quality of education can achieve higher grade of education only the invisible part of them."
The Japanese further pointed out that education as a fundamental human law has a key role in implementing other human rights.
Investment to the rare education of Rome children may mean the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the missionary, it is necessary to establish the knowledge of these consciences in the largest crowds between Roman and Neroman children.
As before, the Roman student begins to school, it will be more likely to stay with the producing member of the work market; by means of payment and consumption of data contributes to the national budget.
"The Rooms are the right of their State residence of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their non-quality and separate education, "Livia Jarok exclaimed.
As a result, the competence of the European Union is necessary with the objectives and action to enhance immediately the acceleration of school disagreement processes, which is essential to maintain existing and planned antidiscrimination Regulations.
"It is necessary to load the cross of poverty, seregation and unemployment, to provide Roman children the possibilities given to demokratic space to be able to be full-righteous to participate in the future of Europe," asked the Yakok.
Everyone is in the meaning of "European Year of Equalities" the objective of the European Equality Amount of Equality Agency, arranged each year from the lonely meeting in Berlin, to ensure the same forum that helps to achieve equality objectives and elimination of discrimination referred to on the level of all European and individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary mercy
The jurisdiction of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Even through the courageous choice debates, the debat of personal questions was still declined.
The presidency of Erwin Huber and the Land Premier Günther Beckstein can still stay in their places, the question is until this kind of kindness ends.
On the randem struggle that has suffered the catastrophical 17% of the loss of the voice, the last week of a strange congress.
The members of the very criticised duty have not heard that they will not be rent on their beds from all powers.
So they tried to calm down the separate fractions and bases, which, because of the loss of absolute majority, required a day after the "Baboric costs" to carry out personal results.
Five years ago - true, yet under Edmund Stoiber's leader, standing on the top of the carriers - received the Christian-social Union 60,7 per cent, now, a year after the destruction against Stoiber, however, the powers were just 43,4 per cent.
CSU was produced in Bavors, 18% of the German HDP "common control" throughout the 46 years.
They still have concerts in the southern society country that has a key importance for the Hungarian economics, high positions, but in the future they will always be driving to the coal in the future.
One of the first characters of the reorganisation within the parties is the fact that a member of a serious investigation team who begins the adoption of an accidental migration policy with the Liberal FDP, respective to the right orientated cost of the Free Health, will also be the Chairman and the Social Minister of the Agriculture of Horst Seehofer, which is considered for the possible Representative of Huber.
It is irony that on the officer of the Liberian volunteers, Gabriel Pauli, whose exemption against Stoiber used two Huber-Beckstein to carry out, but then, with the ambitional Community policy, they did a short process.
The CSU representatives now concentrate all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role also appears to Stoiber, who still broke down the ground, the ancient land premier, and some CSU President called on 28 September the latest day of his political career.
On the Sunday, Huber destroyed several clue notes on the CDU address, in accordance with him they would serve a greater support from the sister parties.
Further CSU policies interpreted the threat as warning and for CDU and Angel Merkelo.
After the elections in Bundessag on September 2009, Mercel will not be a officer if the CSU who played a significant role in 2005 will not be placed on the feet.
According to the Mercels, which had hardly hidden their declaration, the CSU's negative impact on the Berlin's big coal will not be lost.
It is, of course, related: monitoring the CSU is not easier and the crisis of social democracies continue.
The SPD has received 18,6 per cent of the most difficult results since 1946.
Lukašenka:ozoce - 110:0
In weekly choices, there was no opposition messenger in the White Parliament.
This may be explained according to Russian observators of the beauty and stability in the country leading Alexandr Lukašencem, in particular under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) of the laws that have been fulfilled in the number of votes.
OBSE, which sent 450 observators from 43 countries, was not recognized.
Although the 110-year-old Congregation of 10 million countries have been able to reach the opposition of 10 years, the occasion in the name of the United Nations Democratic forces (OSS) was seriously trusted in Lukashenko, which had laid down on the basis of changes of the provisions in the process of discussion in 2006 and the number of its President's mandate, this time "recommends" to be in the Parliament increasingly optically.
The ODS has also been disappeared from the previously considered battle.
In the background of the opposition expectation, it was that economically stronger in the Russian Russy - which, in the decrease of the impact of the Russ' import of the country plan, had been able to believe and also contributed to the company of Beltransgaz, the owner plane of the countries that passed into Russian hands - to improve the relations of the European Union with the White Russical Political Development as an anti-mocratic Luxemburg and other policy policy.
Forward, OBSE showed that the pre-selectable campaign was immediately in the evaluation of the pre-selective campaign, and not on any disasters, for example, the mandate of candidates for third-population candidates.
The Monday Blue Report of the OBSE had, however, already had expenditures and campaigns, during which the opposition candidates could not be found in the pressure, especially in the fact that the absence could not be the current number of votes.
Furthermore, in the political system, it can only be improved: Political prisoners were released to freedom and Minsk are able to depart with Moscow and to smaller confrontation, when they still refused to recognize the Greece of South Osset and Abchasia, Russia, with whom the Creator of Belarus in the Sweden State, considers that these two countries have not been revealed.
"We did two steps before and one back, but the most important is that he started the dialogue between the Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevič.
According to the opposition candidate of the President's elections in 2006, it is requested to remain like that, although "the only member of the opposition has been able to leave to the unexpected Parliament."
In view of the results of the obsession, the protest action is not planned, often trying to handle the electoral report on the needs of economic reform.
"For this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition lists in Russia, distributing the transmission of local authorities, and so I see that the change supports any more people, and among the elders," said Milinkewitch, to indicate that Lukašenki's mode, which considers the creation of social security, does not based on the right or officially the best support of the travellers.
"Because the property of the country and the growth of the trade deficit is only a question of time when social security is called the silence of the grave," judges Milinkevič.
The Russian elections were considered as democratic.
The mission of the Community independent States of Sergei Lebedev, the Russian Report Agent Ria Novosti said that "the people don't believe in words but doing things," so the absence of obsession is nothing other than the proof of violation of the white chocolates.
Brunett: "On now a lunch before work."
It's the first in the history of Palace Chigi, which had been led the doors at the arrival and the department of the employees.
However, from today, this new measures will begin to work against mazeless people, against those who sing and then go to the coffee in the work time.
The newspaper has been published today as the Ministry of Public Management, Renat Brunett, and the Secretary-General of the President of Maur Masi.
"First door," says Brunett -- they are a tool for better work, higher exercise, more presentations and more services."
"The new periods of responsibility and transparency are open.
It's one of the reformism," Brunett's still surprised.
The Chigi's Palace will finish the implementation of the Council's presidency in all buildings.
For Massho, "the choice of the doors are important also from the symbolic view."
The Secretary-General confirms, "It was a common procedure with employees and cooperators."
Short, no lunch for work time; no coffee and cross.
Brunett smile and says, "There's nothing better than a regular cappuccine at seven hours of the morning."
In one conference at the Highest Public Manager School
In Romania, the Ministry finally reports that in three months, the disagreement of public employees for the disease has increased 50%, it means 60 thousand persons more yearly in work."
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Italian public management more executive.
"their payment dynamic – explains the Minister – doubled in the last 8-10 years in respect of the private sector and is far more than the inflation percentage."
Thus, thousands of public employees were meeting to deny the standards of Brunett's decree in accordance with the requested Codacons.
"Because the Ministry for the Public Management today presents the ciphers relating to lower absence in the work because of the disease – the writer on the protection of the consumers – the national of the 'fast leones' is not permanently grown.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public trial that were gathered together to proclaim the illegal standards contained in the decree."
In Tara, particularly against the exclusion of a disease that affects activities; the extension of times in which it is possible to control the time limits of control visits and the other standards set out in new ministry provisions.
Working challenges, Napolitan: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy will be 2.500 workers, three persons and twenty-seven remains invalid.
Inal's values confirm that in 2007 we have the rate of 1,200 deaths in the consequence of workers.
These values testify the serious statement that remains one of the main causes of death and ensures at least twice death in comparison with murders.
To rebuild the attention of institutions, social and information on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions 58. the national day of the victims of work offers established at the second week of October.
"The tragic data extended by Anmiel and those tragic reports confirm how important is the matter of safety of work," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitan in the report of the President Anmilu, the National Association for Degraded and Disabilities for the work, Peter Mercandelli.
The head of the State exposes its living income to an insufficient common effort for safety on workplaces, protection of lost workers, support of victims, and cooperation with public measures."
"In the first time, the 'dost' was raised up, truly shared the face in the face of the tragedy which calls to the disruption in the mediums and participate in public measures, however, every day, the reality offers us again dramatic cases, even reacting in their dynamics."
The Pollyton does not say that "the ressources problems are also existing here: it is decided to invest in education and information.
Especially, there are numerous initiatives designed in the field of school to make young people who are in the world of work more clearer.
It is necessary to notify this age, not to be taken into account because of his concernful society, to apply and improve legislation standards.
The Chairman of Gianfranco Fini, of his part, said, "as the death result of the workscreen, makes absolutely critical social status as the consciousness of each of us and brings all institutions to the persuasive effort to end this state."
"What is about the data of the employment, it seems that they show a certain positive rebellion, but it does not suffer that the number of deaths of the results of the employment of the employment is such as alarming," Reaffirmed President Anmilu Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want to just that "sheet of reduction" leads to a smaller attention, because just at the moment when the attention is set, the tragedy will appear.
"We believe that it's actually a lot of little to stop the problem of the rate and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our debt, - he showed Mercandelli – to increase controls and inspections, however, more stronger to achieve in the field of workers' school, and it is now from school age."
"There is still needing another effort - added - what is involved in communication and cooperation with public debt.
But it is most important for responsibility from the parties of employees to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social age."
Mercandelli, finally announced that the progressive degeneration of the progressive degeneration of the rights to the excessive provision for employment victims and the "reduction of supporting care" to which the system is reached in the last years.
"The purpose is therefore to return to the employer's guarantee of ensure - added - because the part of those who are disturbing is not able to convince spontaneousness or reward time since the lawyer's time."
MP3 Players committed, make risk ears
Listen to the longer time of music and use transmitted music devices as MP3 Player can be able to prevent a long time for hearing.
According to the public announcement of the Commission of the European Commission, which is in Brussels developed in one of the official reports in Brussels, the provision of the Committee on Health risks that have been issued and identified in the last time (Csrseri).
"For this scientific opinion, we read in notes, 5-10% of those who listen to music by at least five years by transporting music devices, a week more than a day and holding a high vote device, risks the loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm surprised that so much young people who use often transmitted music and mobile phones on high accustic levels, they can not know their ears in a way of disturbing," says Meglena Kune.
"For scientist inspection, the leader continues -- a clear risk, and it must be quickly reacted.
This is the most important thing that we have to uphold the consumers and publish these information.
We need to review existing control systems in the light of this science detection to be efficient and to keep a step with the new technologie."
Brussel requested the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this issue in regard to the high use of music transport and the increased number of young people laid down the depth of this origin.
"Women, the Executive Officer of the European Commission has concluded that it is necessary to be careful and now the European Commission will believe together with other Members and parties who have taken a problem, which would have been possible to take eventually and to protect children and young people before the creation of the depth which origin is transferred music and similar devices."
In the present time there is already a European safety standard that limits the depth of 100 dB mutual transport devices, however, the fear of the hearing that can be moved to the exposition of similar volumes.
It may be very limited to these difficulties that we are looking for solutions as a reduction of the level and the time of exposure.
In its survey, the European Scientific Committee indicates that the users of music transporting devices, if they use music voice (increasingly 89 decibels) for only five hours for week, overrides the currently valid limits that correspond to the maximum allowance of the work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions after a long time risks for five years of hearing loss.
This problem should be included by 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity may be calculated between 2,5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leaves the free movement of the Commission for the future of the main city
We'll start today, we'll close in March, in June we'll have sums.
This is the calendar given to Campidogli's workers "Commission for the future of the main city of Rome" which has come tomorrow in his new seat at the Caracall's challenges.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission shall set the manufacturers for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the general Council will apply analysis and projects so that they may present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official Railway" Campidolia and his Council of Gianni Germany.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there is all political, social and cultural thoughts, wants to advise Germany – it will be necessary to ensure proposals for the development of Romans which finally use political decisions that remain Giunta and the General Council.
It's not about a change of function, but only about trying to have a place where to work a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be finished and then will be resolved, because this institution must have a complete time limit.
In June, he reports the elder – we will present a strategic plan and use the work that the Commission has implemented for the future of the main city of Rome."
He who commits the Commission with the rest of the fact that its measures are not responsible, Germany replies: "All matters for the work that the Commission will be able to implement and the quality of their proposals.
If there are quality, as the Commission's proposals, and I'm sure in Rome, its contribution will be decided.
The policy is too often raised on the problems of the day and on the treatment that are exposed from time.
We, at least, want to look long and further , in the deep perspective , to work seriously on Rome's development and his future.
Furthermore, the elder of Romans wants to imagine that "the Commission is not a rest of business or a blaf: it's very serious, Roman citizens will not stay nor Euro and serves to think and introduce the best intelligence that the main city has."
For Germany, based on, "he must have a strategy as a standard point, no definitive or difficult point to allow our city's authentic approach to the level needed, and think of a single spirit on his future."
Building that, the elder of Rome, "not be limited only to the current border, but will be looking for much further" not only in the future metropolitic city and its legal state of the main city, but "the role that Rome can and must be fulfilled as the main city of Europe and the Central Sea."
Obama? First anti-American President.
One known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President."
Jimmy Carter was the first one who described his decisions to the United States' economy and maintained relations (as as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam."
The reactions against Obam are just in the moment when the date of choice is close.
A lady with Miami wrote on the web, "This man is a full ambition.
But Obama has a threat: he thinks that he will come to the highest position of the nation who has two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks do not say much; they are a race of race, and they do not answer the question of the volunteers: it will be a good president? and then we have a research; and they say that Obama will win and will be great.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One news from Mississippi, from the south of the United States, wrote comment: at least one in the choice cabin, we know who gives his voice of American patriot.
It's on the plane of one side of American mentality that remains to the last time.
Say what you want, finally, we're going to make sure we're going to shut up if Obama or McCaina."
There are people who swear: if we should win Obama, we would go from America.
There are things that haven't yet been spoken, seems like a certain success of the black candidate.
However, over all these concerns for democracy is the main weapons of George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: What mistake did Bush do during his mandate? 80% answered: Iraq.
America's changed.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a coward to the back.
In Iraq, the life of 4500 soldiers was saved and the Americans were not able to disappear.
And yet Iraq became for the most Bus' hardship.
Whoever comes to Georgie B will have to do a great task.
The United States Economic Coffee also felt newspapers: in the newspapers there are a period of investigation, and many accused the Internet, "shooter" pressure.
PEW Research Center has been achieved five hundred newspapers on the state of their professor and proposal about the future.
Today, they're almost all the Psychiatric News of their future.
However, the questions were not openly said that they had less care about confidence.
They're not feeling isolation as ever.
The problem is for American newspapers, the money.
For these newspapers, the crisis of 2008 is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to make newspapers are a great problem.
According to the requested newspapers, it is a problem that is to resolve if we don't want to be traditional journalism as a understanding of her large publicity.
The American newspaper is clear, but complex pesimism.
Six of the ten newspapers of printing and executive seniors are convinced that newspapers are in the national measure a bad way.
In the local area, there is 65% of the implementation group.
It was pulled up against the broadcast.
For newspapers, it's not hard to see where the web is going.
The larger facility is once the way to the Internet, which many look as a "shooter" pressure.
"Economic clothes", on which the newspapers advertised, increased to 79%.
Fifty hundred questioned newspapers agreed that they're inclined to the technologies in hope that their newspapers are "reaching something good."
The biggest propaganda in the American newspaper is between those who lead newsrooms – it means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% leaders at national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value is at 23%.
This has something to do for someone's "perhaps work."
The leaders who think they lose workplace for three years are at national level 47%.
What's about newspapers, they're moved to 30%.
If it's about "the existing work" relating to the personal (their editor, ndr) in America is still at the day.
Only 13% of the newspapers work on the contract.
In a large nation like Us, three hundreds of million people and thousands of news, magazines, radios, TVs and Internet employers often offer what they want, so they are to take or leave.
The leaders have almost a lot of payments and the editor can pay 10 thousand dollars a monthly outside payment and ensure.
What is then allowed, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until the end of 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American newspapers, according to their own reconnaissance, are often sick during a year.
It's only a climate question.
UNIPOL: SUD IN RIES, DANILO COPPOLE OF THE GROTFERRATE
President of the Second Court of Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the businessman with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested to move from his city, Grottaferrat, to residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated as a bankrot in accordance with the Protection Protection for the Union-Bnl.
During the process on its own costs, the last week of release from the home prison, which was changed to a permanent residence in Grottaferrate.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the businessman with realities could change the place of residence from the foreign city to the main city.
However, according to the judgment of this movement (for whom pm was expressed), it would allow him to influence his company and to get evidence that they commit him.
Elity in danger
This show has already appeared a few days ago when the Commission voted against the Safety Plan to provide 700 billion dollars to the White House: the significant part of the Americans was more interested and interested in Wall Street's supply than the safeguarding of the economy.
They confirm it even yesterday in New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis develops the Republic party, unfortunately divided between their old souls of East Coast, more deeply, closer to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul that is obviously conserved, enemies to the Washington's world's financing, especially strong in the countries in the middle and on the south.
The soul that was arrogantly expressed the voice I spoke at the beginning.
This is, however, a single example of changes, which have already shown the current economic agriculture: not only in the United States but in all cases and may not only be here.
As in Uz, so in Europe it seems that this crisis works as a acelerator of eggs that have been in the incubacy for a long time, which are in the new climate, and finally go to light.
The first of these equipment is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary market living, the double state-force category in relation to a certain renewable economy.
The crisis is the crisis of bank financing institutions, which, of course, have strong train in the frontiers, but in which the most largest payment of people and families live in the only country, in the same country.
What has now been created political problems for those who lead him: it means to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are outside other choices.
A short crisis is economically worldwide, but politically nearly nationally.
The political international seems to be basically outside the game or that there is nothing to add: a clear evidence of the European Union, which is divided as always between various interests and various state strategy, which cannot be decided for a common policy line.
So all expect the principle of governments of each individual State, safe plans, market reliability, new rules and mainly separation of funds: in the time we get to pressure, only States have economic resources, many financial resources to be able to try to get all right.
It is also necessary for its own funds and permissions to use them: two sources of non-creasing values, for certain circumstances, which may have no market and no international organization will ever be available in such a way.
This new emphase, which the crisis is based on the State-National element, is, in the same accord, a greater significance that is trying to achieve the last economic progress to be condemned to one of the factors related to it: the national competence.
Paradox in fact, while we were convinced that we entered into the Kingdom of the network, still sophisticated technologies, immaterial, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already predicted to govern the world, and we didn't know that our future must continue to walk more with such little immaterial things such as water, worry, nafta.
All things that would be said can be moved from one place to the other, but in every case, absolutely, to the territory of space, grounds.
So whoever becomes their government, he's probably more caret in his hand than who's not with him and who's worth that he lives in a place without power, without water.
I'm getting to the second news, however, who's prejudiced to evil.
Whoever speaks about the territory, the State, the government, speaks independently about the policy, so about the rulership.
With regard to economic crisis, it seems that two convergent ices are created.
On one side, it is obviously necessary for the authorised leadership, the request of a person who would have been able to conduct the situation.
On the other hand, there is no discrimination against the existing leadership, especially the economic, which has shown the same inevitable and full of dark places.
And together, something more deeper and in a certain meaning of discredibility: discredibility, indulgence, feelings of insufficiency and disabilities that are trying to control the entire government class in still more western countries.
It seems that there is still more extensive in wide mass of citizens than to be their acts like the thoughts of still popular elections, such as their way of feeling and lives, as their culture in the right meaning of the word that elita has already accomplished its time and is low to the major views.
The requirement of guidance is shortly exceeded from the ground of one field, however, the strengthening pressure for the elimination of governments and traditional political arrangements is shown in the non-anual choices' eligibilities' or in unexpected changes of collective in the last and latest time, from the concert in Rakous-Bavors to the loss of labour in the United Kingdom, with the United States Congress against Bush (with it may have a faith and truth in Italia).
We have found that traditional elite, their sides, their programmes, but also their ceremony, their news, their credited intelligence, someone would say their form, they still have greater problems to understand, therefore represent what, not from today, are created in the deep-sized west society and that economic crisis reforts, grows, potentially overclose clouds.
Before this, it would be refused to speak about the permanent "mass" storage.
But we're sure we can't say that it means to have exactly open eyes.
Super leaflet to walk through the walls
Make sure the laws of gravity thanks to super lepidle and in the future to walk through the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of the various American research center and now the four institutions are very close to him.
The scientists have been able to maintain the body on the vertical wall by using the pads of only 2,5 cm of fourth centimeters.
STTUDIUM – American magazine Science published the revelations of some researchers in the University of Dayton, Acrona, Georgian Technology Institute and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that found the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use the special structure of the carbon, which is called carbon treatment.
“Because, we can imagine as a series of trubs placed as a sort of spaget shop," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Technology Institute in Atlantic.
The scientists inspired the feet of gekone, covered by microscopic groups that allow animals to ensure perfect attachment.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the ball, Teflon and the nice paper showed that the new leaflet is ten times stronger than the feet of these plastics and currently's easier to get away from the wall's," explains Liming Dai, investigator of the Ingenerary Faculty of Dayton University.
CHODIT TO ZDECH? - "This material could be useful as a provisional leaflet" adds Liming Dai.
Can't be moved after the wall like Spiderman? Yes, but the researchers think about less fascinating use as the connection of electric equipment, because the aircraft carbons are tea and electric energy waters.
Other applications may be related to the aircraft cosmic ingegnery .
I'm just no super heroes.
ADMINISTRATE – The University of Berkley, California, is also carried out to the research of a new leaflet.
In one article of the American Chemical Society, the California scientists presented a leaflet formed from micro balls as hairs that are clean from the ball movement on the table to keep the perfect attitude.
Medicines: never with thicks
Watch the grep, midnight and jabber thief.
If you take these drinks, especially in the year, because they are light and full vitamins, together with some savings of medicines, their use is changed or reduced with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, Professor Western Ontario, in London, raised the risks of juices as ready, as well as low in combination with some medicines, just 263. National meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia calls a new place: enough one box of grep, midnight and jabber steel to reduce the consumption of certain living livings, to promote their proper efficiency and the creation of risks of patients.
Greece was already convinced that it is responsible to increase the effects of some anti-arithmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamin and neurological medicines.
ANNEX V RIZIKU – The same Italian medical agent in the information bulletin two years ago, and he burned doctors and patients to not exceed the dangers that are exceeding this cycle and to notify what they drink in the case they may have medicine, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEJEN GRAPEFRUIT – The experts also contain the medicine that cut out.
A long list of effects with grapefruit and other jugs.
From here, Michele Carruby, Director of the Farmakological Division of the State University in Milan: "Those revelations are most immediately reported to the most different international and national medical agents, which will eventually organise and replace information instructions of medicines.
So read always the illustrative lists of medicines you can get and if you press something amazing, don't deny yourself, but ask a doctor or a doctor to explain," he replied an expert for the Ansa agent.
Nobel for economy Paul Krugman
Nobel's price was added to Paul Krugman for his trading models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New York Times, who teaches the University of Priceton and is a known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criteria in the area, economic and political steps of the Busho's administrative.
A few months after attitudes in September 2001, in the days when Enron crashed, Krugman proposed in one commentary in New York Times that the second event will be, in the meaning of the United States history, much more important than the first.
The responsibility of the person who had not been called at least a field, which was recalled after a year, however, was shown to be exactly.
“I'm surprised and shocked, with what speed the balls like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest, Krugman reported at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenza Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "the economy of great significance", but also the popularist, which has "the very aggressive style, especially critical against the excess of the Busho liberalistic administrative".
Open Office, we have the third package "anti-Microsoft"
It's the day of the Open Office.org 3.0, the open source product package that guides to go to more users, from home to the office, from experts to public service, as an independent alternative of the most known Microsoft Office.
After the yearly work of good workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide publicity with various news: to the invitation of the screen and to the revised and improved opening windows, it will be added more, much more sustainable as compatibility for the operational Apple Mac OS X operational system and supporting a new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last standard ISO.
Now it's loading and cooperating with the Office package 2007, Open Office is able to open a document and with a new Microsoft help (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The interests are special functions of some models such as that allows to reduce PowerPoint presentation sizes, useful for an electronic path, or to transfer PDF directory to a graphical model and to maintain the original view of the pages.
We still can create documents "PDF hybrids" which are like Adobe's typical graphical format and have the properties of the table processor or the text program.
The cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programmes: exceedingly, it is possible to work together between different users and to exceed conflicts on changes, in the text program, one color is added to each cooperator to comments to be a clearer identification in the audit phase.
Some companies also work on the transfer of some Open Office to the Web (on the cloud), and in the next weeks should stop definitive results.
The Italian version is able to download on http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to English version that is located on myror from five.
Except Windows and Mac OS, it is usually a package also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd can also be sent to the request to home or to the worker.
And if the subject of unrequiredness may be a threat to expand in households, the Open Office Package is just a lot of interest in the business area, and it can already be calculated with the most different projects implemented by public training and schools.
And there is no benefits for school, consultation and assistance ideal for small and central company, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office is based on five main models: Writer, for video writing Word; Calc is a table processer that directs to Excell; Impress for the similar PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, as in the case of more glorious access, is a program that allows work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The target for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and when we assume that we are at least 3 million and 600 thousand, the new version is possible that this number may also be convinced.
The results of Cohla are positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
The new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is about Rakuschan Bernhard Kohla, from the third classified and winning the best top of the trick.
The report quoted the L'Equipe journal pages.
26 years old, Cohl is the fourth officer of the positive leader on Ceru, Epo third generation, after Italec Riccard, and Leonard Piepoli and German Stephen Schumacher, and he was from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood models of Kohla fall into those who were carried out in the last weeks of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the position on Ceru, Rakushan will lose the third place in Tour and shall be fulfilled for two years of diskvalidation.
The report of Cohla on Epo's third generation confirms the Boss of the French Antidoping Agency Peter Bordry, who announced Associated Press that he has already informed the result of the Russian Government authorities.
In 26 years, Rakušan was located on the passenger victories after the Spanish Carlos Sastrem and the American Cadel Evansma, and he also received the best top trick.
IMIGRANTI: NEW YORK TIMES THAT THE ITALIE SUSTIST?
Italy's "come the country of emigrants only has changed in the last house to the priority targets of accessors" accepted with the resistance.
Is it a beautiful land to the nation of rasists? So it is in a long article of New York Times, which has brought this debate on the theme in Italy, and began by the case of young Abdula William Guibre, origin from Burkiny Faso, the last month killed in Milan, because he struck the smoke.
This case shows what New York Times defines "paradox north": the north areas are currently those who are registered "increasing integration and more work", but also "the most strongest anti-prospective thoughts in the country and the most strongest support of the North Ligue".
To ensure that the higher attack between Italy and the accommodation, NYT quotes the cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Roman, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required Legislation, which is trying to ensure the advancement of illegal approachers, is citated as an example of climate change in Italy.
The tendency as a papa, as President of the Republic: "Gorgio Napolitan, after he met Benedette XVI in Quirinale, requested to stay and the church to work together for racist."
Students of victims of favorite names - to 900 euros for room
Universal students don't know the crisis.
According to the recent researchs of Sunia, advocates, a single room can be in Milan to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Neapoli 650, in Rome 600.
"He has already reached these measures that the whole level of students have lost the right to study because of all high prices that their families should be able to deal with – explaining the leadership officer for the study of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city a large question from the parties of the students had deformed the market in such a way that he undertake the price process that increased as well as residents."
In most cases, the benefits of the nomination contain a number of transactions: the contract freely, unregistred, unlimited, unlimited.
For Sunji, it is required to be an exceptional provision that may be regulated by the data review.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in Brianza, needs one bed at about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from the minimum price 650 (bane Nere) over the average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria).
In Florence, one bed in average of 350/400 euros, one room almost 700.
In Bolónia, where students concentrate in near university areas, 250/280 euros for bed in double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome, in the Centre Universital Areas (San Lorenzo, the Bolón port), they want 600 euros for a single room, 450 lens in a double-level.
The values are smaller (550 euros for a single) in the areas near the other university (Ostiense and Cinecity).
We will only check if we move to peripher areas: 300 euros for bed and 450 for a single room of Prenestina, Centocelle, and similar.
In Neapoli, 300/450 euros are rooms from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic areas, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euro bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In small towns, the prices are very smaller, but they have greater impact on the economy of the citizens.
In the cities such as Perugia, where the most frequent range of students outside the European Union is finally mentioned one another anonymous: the increase of 25-30 per cent of the population that wants foreign students in comparison with Italians.
Goodbye to the old kid of Paradiso, the city moves historical salaries
Kinematographic historical salaries are closed in multiplex.
"The city without the hair is like a blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The image of Giuseppem Tornator has successfully documented what happens in large Italian cities, but also foreign cities.
The process of restriction of the chinese, the birth of large multisales on the subject and the following monosal in the center areas of the cities is one of the events that seem to be unresolved and unresolved, but also have all the signs of real cultural crime.
Sometimes the historical location has been raised by reminders," it is like if we had come about a friend, the knowledge of the way we shared in the way and much emotions," encourages the new architecture of Paradiso, a movie that had received Tornator Oscar for 20 years ago and the great price of the ransom in Cannes, which announced the position of a universe in the way of life that would be lost forever.
The reached Annec, the main group of managers, speak clearly: In the last five years, the door of 316 kids of traditional type was closed, and the highest account was payed to the first salaries in the most important cities: at least 10 min in Florence, 9 in Milan, Neapoli, Boloni and Roman, about 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palerm.
In the middle of the regions the most attached conclusions of Emilia-Romagna are lost 82 Chinese salts, followed by Toscans (44) and Lombardia (41).
The first responsible for their mission is a multiplex approach, just these three Italian regions recorded the highest number of new Chinese multisalales: about 195 platters more in Lombardia in the last five years, about 81 and in Tokyo, as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
“Italian Procedure has been developed neutrally” says Paul Protti, President Anecu, is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that you already survive, because when one kino is closed in the city, not all his visitors are wanted to move to multiplex.
Then we don't even talk about the essential question on the fund in the benefits of the manufacturers: the previous State debt is over 10 million euros.
In view of moral and ethnic, the government does not respect existing laws.
For the support of the sector, it would be necessary between 16 to 18 million euros each year.”
It is interesting, the first Italian town, which is concerned with the conclusions and decided to find an earlier signature of the protocol between the alien and Anec, first this type in Italy to protect and propagate small chips as in historical centres, as well as on the subject.
The standards planned are steps of payment in the use of manufacturers and the costs for the public for the movement: divines will be able to enter into the area with limited transport and will have special prices to stop and at some parks.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornator, "I hope that the other cities will follow the example of the Bolón's implementation of other measures."
However, it is sure that to be able to set up against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more popular.
The traditional kitchen is the subject that was always important: the closement of Superpine in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and advancement, was a surprise that convinced me to make "New Paradiso" that I thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome 25 years ago, and when I walk before the locked Rialt or Kirinal in the National Street, where I shared so many emotions to not be able to see the records of the smoke, I will turn around the other side."
Connection between the political and mafia group 'landrangheta, ancient Gioie Tauro in prison
"Starosta from Gioie Tauro was to edit the choices of the city under the interests of the Mafia Group of Piromalli."
The accusations that the Government against Mafia in Calabria reaches against the care and vice-star of Gioie Tauro Giorgiana to Dal Torrione and Rosario's Shiavone, and Rosarna Carlu Martelli, arrested this morning because of external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are hard.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his advocate, the name of the boss, already committed by the violation of the Mafia crimes, condemned to the border of 10 million euros.
"Ignore all legal and moral standards, as well as healthy understanding," writes the State leaders when two local managers expressed the opportunity to pay advice to Piromalli.
"Therefore the Mafia group would allow the judges to write officially to enter the cities and to improve the so large control and administration of public administrations."
The Chairman of the California Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not state that "the secret agreement between local institutions and organizated criminal submissions is in his country a lot of: "There are areas in which the concentration of mafia is stronger than others where the secret agreements are unlimitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies who are able to attach the branches, the heroes who are still unresolved."
The prisons of this morning follow after the prison since July of the last year, which the police showed that the Mafia Group of Piromal had been finally .
Since the end of April, the city Council of Gioii Tauro was already discovered since 1991, the reason that the connection was also proposed between the organizated criminal and local administration - were the local policies of the current process.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian democracies, who was chosen at the time of destruction, was chosen by the head of the right center after the broad choice in May.
He cried because of the skandal when Prefecture ordered the desolation of the general counsel.
He called to the responsibility of the Ministry within Mark Miniti and convinced him that he had all recognised from political reasons, but the judges in the Regulation on the approval of this morning explained that the Mafia group has increased even so far as long as he requested to change the draft A3.
In addition to the results of the confrontation of Dal Torrion, a public officer, a "ochota to move the proceedings of the businesser, representative of some larger groups of closer groups as usually known, Piromalli, and apply the options of public management to the Mafia group."
When the energy originates from the valley, they're going to the big ones.
It's an infinite ground that increases more than 70% of the earth's surface, and now it begins to demonstrate a large world energy company.
The skins, the skins, the skins, the difference of the new sources of non-speaking energy, on which he has suffered the face of the cools like Chevron, which is now trying to stretch up his hands on these sources.
The ability to create energy from sea movements is studied more than hundred years and in 70 years, in relation to the first round crisis, the investigation has been intensified.
When the price was reduced in 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy has gone on the side, but now the environmental organization and the new increase of the price of the rope has given a new impulse sector.
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 announced that at least 15 per cent of the world's power consumption could be hidden by using the movement of the sea.
This quantity would be a double energy which is currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there's also a difference and a difference.
The fucking smoke.
The company based on the sea energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 that it sets a device in North Portugal.
When this goal was declared, it seemed to be a great revolutionary step.
After two years, which is in the sea energy, is still more society, which are driving on sea energy better than traditional energy.
"Chevron studys the energy technology of the ocean - has been expressed a speaker of one company that is connected to a round colon of the United States, in economic news of Wall Street Journal - and think about the opportunity to cooperate with us."
The cooperation on which we consider is concerned to obtain authorisation from the United States Commission for Energy which is necessary for the development of the project for the use of marine energy in Aljash.
We can't appreciate this signal, especially when we take into account that just at the United States Aljash is driving food and the President Bush has come with a plan for a new challenge.
Except Chevron sees the part of the sea energy and Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the following invested sums, even though they are not detailed, they show the growing interests.
Technology, the chera needs to work.
Experts are talking about the technologies that are still in the beginnings, because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy in the environment.
For example, the installation in Portugal and some in Scozia is small and does not seem to make great ecologist problems.
For the greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a larger impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the battle system that are connected between themselves.
The power of the ball that moves with battles up and down is changed by helping wars and cilindros to the hydraulical press inside these fears.
Click splits the turbine that adds energy to the generator.
Energy is achieved on the border of the submarine cabels.
In the case of projects, four devices of this type are expected only for federal approval and part of energy could serve for military purposes.
At the same time, Verdant Power now produces energy for purchase centre and parking use of six pd marine turbines in New York East River.
The movement of the water during the dilution and the dilution causes the turbine that the generator lives by this active movement.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients who wait for the required authorisation for the possibility of use of this energy.
After the bottom, after the bottom, and after the difference.
The special interest in this time serves the potential of rate and difference, says in the Institute for Energy Research.
Although the incompatible factor, the floor and the difference are more precautive than the wind, the sun or the wood, and then it is more comparable than the energy source.
Right to the energy and department of the states such as New York, Maine and Aljaška, and with other countries invested 7 and half million dollars in 2008 and proposed the investment to 35 million dollars for 2009.
