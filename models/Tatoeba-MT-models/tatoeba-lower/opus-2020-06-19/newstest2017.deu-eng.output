Golfer Longer receives sportpyramide
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golfturnier in South Africa, Bernhard Langer met some colleagues looked for a little exchange with an expenditure on the street.
For the 58s, it was a premier.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses recalled their fever bowls, they smoothed in the fast gall to house to the futter trains.
A kilometer at this time, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good life," said Langer.
And that's why the carriers finished again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golf of all times - 101 Turners - back near the horses.
He went with his family about the ALRV's attachment to a horse, he didn't switch to photographs.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and so also in the CHIO.
The reason was persuaded.
The German sports helped the man from households in the frame of a small gala the golden sportpyramide.
The sympatic sportler is not required.
Budding service cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already added him.
Longer is the 18. Pressors of sportpyramide.
In Aachen, he found the first prices of Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This exhibition means me very much," says Langer, "if she is not only for sports but also for social commitment."
Since decades, longer grows.
And so he also gave the price payment of 25,000 euros likewise.
With more 15 extra sports, the two-second US Master officer was taken in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports".
With the signs, the Lightathlete Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fever Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Ard Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Faher Myhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springer Alwin Schockemele and the handballer Erhard wonderfully.
Many of these sport officers came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society turned into the Spring Stadium where the Lavazza price lived.
Bernhard Langer had a distance to the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: It's all about the money
Investment in infrastructure and prevent the TTP Agreement - as well as Clinton and Trump.
However, both US competitors are in the establishment and energy policy, as well as in a principle question.
The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on more philosophy differences.
He, over the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep the smaller and warn how the State of Economic can hurt - with controls and regulations.
Clinton wants to establish the economy to die and regulate death, he says.
He would be very different to himself, the Trump.
He will return regulations massively, and he will make himself for a wide steel reform with smaller stewards - for private leaders and for enterprises.
Clinton says that the State has certain tasks to fulfill, he has the opportunity to open and needs money.
That is why the resources would increase, says they.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of the infrastructure.
In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say nearly equal.
The democratic competitor reports the greatest investment in new workplaces since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are also rejected by the State Critical Tea Party Flights of the Republicans.
Thus, on Trump, there could still be part-internal discussions.
The differences in the energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power works and to reach the coal promotion in the United States.
The oil promotion should also be possible in long-term protected areas, the Parise Climate Agreement will be achieved.
Clinton wants to build the renewable energy with its investment programme explicitly and asks: "A country will be the super-governmental power of the weaker energy and make millions of jobs."
"It's likely to be China, Germany or America -- I want that we are."
However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not very far away from each other.
TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
Likewise, both of the United States do not want to isolate from the international trade - but just protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, some Clinton requests.
The current minimum rate of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.
He wants to increase her at $15 per hour.
Whatever Trump wants to do in this question is not clear: Once he says, the minimum steel must go out, then he says he cannot be changed.
However, the great discussion of the next months should be more to develop the policy of the two layers.
On one side there is Trump who wants to leave the economic and the citizens to explore growth.
His criteria will prevent him that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the riches to pay more money, and their critical criteria says: More taxes are not the solution.
Flight: "Every women fled have experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is for women who flee alone, almost all day.
When they come to Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers a refuge.
In a big kitchen, four women sit in a big kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who's at least a year old.
One put her little son into the arm.
He's kidding with great eyes in the room.
His mother looks on the table.
Before she knows that she will be watched.
She smiled shortly and kiss the kids.
The scene works normally.
Before you're talking to Katrin Bahr.
She is the officer of Condrobs, a traveler for social support offers in Bayern, and works otherwise with the subject of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are flying.
They live in the Mounchner North in one of the few decently decent businesses for solemn women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Family and the municipal women's support.
Unfortunately, they were officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There's no - neither as a visitor.
The exception is a waxman before the door.
"It is not overtreated to say, 'Every woman who comes here has made her experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.
"Women flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are struggled by fields or death, or because their family sent them to Europe as hope travelers," she says.
In women there are other reasons for the flight: "More of them are hidden because they don't see other ways."
In their home, they have experienced sexual violence, weaknesses, honor murders, slavery or weak prostitution.
It's going to get it.
It's on the flight.
"This slepper, for example, require a sexual action for a flash water, is not a saleness," says Bahr.
And women are alone, they will not be protected from their families.
Whoever believes that it ends when they arrive in Germany, he says Barr.
In this case, only women in flights would be often considered as less valuable and loss of the worst case.
This means that about 90 per cent of women who live in the north munchners are traumatised.
"Any of the children are sure they are not free."
Many women are so living that they don't say anything.
"Of they don't trust to speak open about the living, because the shame is too big."
While they are not often helping themselves, it needs more subventions only for them, requested by Bahr.
In Bayers, the seven officers are competent to subtract flights.
At the question of whether they knew a similar project as in munchens in their competence area, some answers with no.
In the surface and superfrance, there is nothing such in the governments.
Even in the swapes only women are not separated, says Karl-heinz Meyer, the presence of the Government.
In the highways, under- and central sources, there are Stockworks or own houses only for only women and their children.
The exception is neighborhood, there are two central undertakings exclusively for women.
In the European Parliament, the Commission also requests the "Rights of the Women and Equality of the Genesis" that women should be taken separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It's very important that men and women will be held separately."
"If the privacy stages or are undertaken together men and women, it can come to - continuing - violence against women."
In particular, the rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women are in the study.
How much the women have this protection need, you can put it on Andrang, which is in the house in München.
"Before he's talking, we have a long list of wait," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistance forces: requests for new workshop measures
The representatives of the assistance officers have invited their company to approve new work-up measures in their training for a new contract.
The Junior Doctor Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested the full Council to approv more work-up adoption from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that the Ministry would agree to enter the concerns on the Treaty.
Assistance and medicine students have agreed in July on the establishment of a Treaty associated with the BMA.
He was rejected from 58% of his members who have been voted with the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Sunday night, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the Government would have remained "consistently peaceful" to problems that the Treaty had been rejected.
She said, "In that regard, the JDC has agreed to completely reject the proposed new Treaty and requested official new negotiations to all your concerns."
As a response to the Government's Swiss, the JDC state has now made a formal request to a specific meeting of the BMA Council to approve an executive programme of employment measures, which begins in September.
The fights led to that assistance forces in this year were six times stretched, the first total cases in the history of NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistance guarantee Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election of the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared BMA members during the meetings, which were still submitted by 54,000 assistants and medical students before the vote, with that the Treaty should be worthless and accepted.
After the vote, the Ministry of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for doctors would be introduced immediately in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Aliance of Foreign Seas"?
It was a stone that ended a crisis.
The Russ Leaders and Turkey tried to give up their hands and to proclaim a official end of the eight months long-term wars of the words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish player in the golden room of St. Petersburger Palastes, I can't reject the impression that Ankara wants this reward in most.
There's the hand, yeah.
But Putin's songs acted smoothly and he smoothed a lot of warms, even for his absent relationships.
Recep Tayip Erdogan had said again by his "living friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promises that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.
On the next day, Erdogan described a magazine that Erdogan would have taken himself as if there was nothing worse.
I looked like his dishusysism was to add the same part.
But one of Putin's explosive, sustainable hair showed that the Russ' captain had nothing forgotten.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction rules: the committee of a Russian fighter at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moskau reaction at that time was branched.
Putin shared and accused Ankara to be cut into the backs.
The procedure was even greater because it had been made by an unbelievable friend.
Rebuilding veterinary will be difficult if it is not possible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the State controlled media have made an increasing, unlimited attack on Ankara.
One time it seemed like the tours would take the crime for all.
The seriously accused of officers that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, which would be controlled by the same Islamic State.
He did this very much.
But in St.Petersburg the official message said that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was found only because Putin had received the excuse that he wanted to hear.
Russia could build a type of guig.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapons station are clearly on the hand.
Erdogan needs in the first line all friends that he can get after the last month he was taken to a successful country of his office.
Repeat terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shot him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have been severe - especially the prohibition of charter flows that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish castle.
The number has returned about about 90 %.
In Russland, traveling and charter companys will be improved when the flows are recovered.
They are counting a post-sature at the Mediterranean.
This week prognoses the State-based vital bottles and vegetables while the Turkish agricultural imports are reiterated.
A report in Vedemosti stated: "Tourists there long, tomates here long."
But the visit had a more political value for Moscow.
Ankara is smoking on the west because it considers his reaction to the tempted power transmission as weak response.
In this context, the continuing role on the snow-time of EU adventure negotiations and Putin is to take out of the cutting use and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west.
The Russian State Board guaranteed a Bonus in Ankara with confidence that he requested a support for the chosen state officers after the tested State.
This is good for Moscow a self-comprehensive understanding that itself has a deep fear for regulation changes.
In this glassful Palast on the sea, Russia and Turkey have allowed me to describe an analytical, "Aliance of Foreign Seas": two countries who feel evil and treat themselves from the West and now disappoint themselves.
However, although the public release, there is still a great differences between both.
The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given the role as peaceful staff, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting additional pages.
It may be significant that, at least three hours, two Presidents had said that they wouldn't take the subject once.
The President of Turkey decreed it to answer a question of their differences, while Putin decided to consider it.
There is no clear consensus about where a joint name in Syria can be found.
But after months of open enemies - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster than the NATO member of Turkey to the Russian fight abschoss - it is certainly better to talk to the two state officers at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland
The RBS mark shall be reduced by the Bank's Station Board at least a Backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS marks were linked to the global ambitions of the Bank.
The bank has been distant since she had to have to be collected and saved for eight years ago.
In this time, market strates "RBS" used to protect other final consumer financial markets.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds in Sponsoring, from six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she decided to turn more national marks into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references will be changed by the decentral mainsite and the office notation to NatWest.
Mark Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, small marks for the privacy business that will be more significant - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customers and cooperators in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The RSB mark will be on our investors market and the market where our cooperators will be employed because we are now more to a bank of markets."
When the bank was itself to a global mark, RBS was to the global mark.
Now I say we don't follow global goals, but local goals.
Each of these marks will stand for something fully different in their own communities, and our cooperators will work under these markets with the customers.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its six United Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the reality of various marks in his sport sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop the market bank, because how to concentrate us in the internal (which we have asked) to make it to a better bank for customers?" said the staff.
It would have been very cynic three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our clients and have launched these marks.
But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can restart these marks, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori is gained at Predilection its 3000 winnings in Newmarket
Dettori breaks Champagner after a double at Newmarket who brings him 3000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori saved 3000 British winning on Newmarket on Friday.
He set on predilection trained by John Gosden on his local ring streets with his second winning of the night a milestone.
The 45-year Italian is the sixth Jockey, which gets the milkstone in the floor.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The triangle Dettori, who won before at Ghayjar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here
I'm very happy about that it happened in Newmarket because I was here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal free day night with 20,000 people.
I'm nice and very decisive.
Dettori takes the jubel when he takes the guest on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the meilenstein in the front of the front - Jockey Richard Johnson and the pensioned 20-master Sieger Sir Anthony McCoy, which has reached more than 4.300 seats in a recorded carrier.
Lester Piggott, the nine-seeger, had 4.493 carriers
Frankie is one of the best Jockey of the Moderne, and it's not surprised that he has achieved this milk stone that just got a little before him.
He has a style and is strong, but it's his tactic intelligence that separates him from others in the weight control room.
He's a fantastic newspaper for traveling, his dehusiam and Charisma's fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he had already got 6000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big-term jockey!
Frankie has already reached the guests in GB about about 30 years, what is great.
He has a living person, which is good for a British rent, but out of that he is an incredible Jockey.
Frankie Dettori feeded the meelstein with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori is the absence of the British Flachrone since two decades.
It was nervous.
A total number of big turniers, including his glorious "Gloria Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a aircraft and received a drug prohibition.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-monatic sperre, but he showed an impressive strength to honor his two-fishers and return to his best form.
And he's not yet long at the end - Dettori said before, he wanted to continue in competition until he's at least 50th years of life.
Russian Putin fired Stabschef Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly, left his staff team Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was a part of the worst confidence of Putin.
The 63-year-old was invited to the Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a opinion of the Criml, Putin has said, "Ivanovs has approved its obligations as President of the Russian Press administration."
Anton Vaino, who was a representative of Ivanov's representative since 2012, was called his followers.
Vano, 44, is an old diploma.
In 1972, he was born in the Ethnic capital city of Tallinn, he made his conclusion in the renamed State Moscauer Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the site of the Kreml, it is called (in Russia) that he was later protocol officer and staff leader of the government personnel.
He said to Putin about his name: "Thanks for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your activities as a State Board on law designs and controls to implement your indications.
Putin shared the Russian TV sender on the free day that Ivanov had requested to leave his posts and Annano recommended as his followers.
Convince the smile faces?
This step has made Moscow mysterious lives.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the worst trusted Vladimir Putins and worked as he worked for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, who was explored in the TV, both men said that the staff was returned to its own desire.
But instead of the smiling for the cameras, there are only few of it here - in particular now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So here is the consequence of a kind of power fight?
Nobody knows that.
But the official consideration - that a man who was one of the potential President would want to lead Russian environmental policy once to a large scepse.
In his comments on Putin, which are quoted on the site of the Kriml, Ivanov said "is true that I have asked you in a conversation in the beginning of 2012 to trust me these very complex posts - you could be nearly telling - aware posts for four years.
As it seems, I am four years and eight months of President of the Russian Presidial Management.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
He was the representative of the President and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's marriage member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the past 1990s, as President of the Agreement Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was called his representative.
As Putin raised the power, he called Ivanov as one of the five people who he trusted most.
One was adopted that Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putins the second office time, since a third office of Putins had been struck against the conscience.
But these posts were taken by another, closed Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin was the President of the Ministry before he returned to the President three and half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson burned after he killed products
Gibson was involved in a body-country in the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, reported in a common opinion of its advice.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Sunday before his announcement was published.
In the set, it came to artistic differences and an opinion differences.
I'm offering the case," he said in a communication.
The details of the character Gibsons from the series followed by a group of FBI agents will be published according to the opinion of the ABC studies and CBS Television Studys, in view of a later time.
The 54-year-old, who was playing in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, was since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I have cut my whole heartblog in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a public communication published on free day.
I had hoped to be at the end, but this will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, shoe players, our wonderful crows and, in particular, the best fans you can just want for a series.
The planned exhaustion of the twelve staff is established on 28 September.
Review of fish landing in the gardens in Banff
An inhabitants of Banff requested to identify the fishing assistance that was raised in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be done about sandale who were spread out of a brunch.

Queensferry Crossing: Click now with Fife
The £ 1,35 billion tire project must be completed until May 2017
Ingegners have linked the north deck of the Queenferry Crossings with the viaduct - what means that the bridge is now connected with fifth.
It's the first of the four conclusions of the "deck-blocks", which are close to each of the three doors of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and increases 30,000 tonnes.
He has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of beton and 46 shoes.
The £ 1,35 billion tire project must be completed until May 2017.
Economic Ministry Keith Brown, the building was a visit today, and it was one of the first ones who went from the country to the bridges.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of the Queenferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of a real episode in this project with more than 30,000 tons of beton and stahl that were only used for this part of the bridge.
Instead of the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the conclusion between the vacuum and the bridge is a precipitable activity required by extreme precious tolerances for the passion.
Totally 79% of the entire bottoms at their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a betonus for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be moved on the bridges to its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first conclusion gives a major milkstein in each brief project.
This fantastic project provides the conclusion of the future high- and deep-building.
After the installation of the last travel board and its connection with the North Turm Deck in the building, we had to close the existing cups on the north or land side.
This has been achieved by 700 millimeters in the south of the northern branches.
This was a massive and immediately very heavy activities.
Massive, since the viadute is 222 meters long, about 6000 tonnes and should be moved up to a smoking of ca. 3 %.
Heakel, since the tolerants on the team were winning - on every side they were only a few millimeters.
Happyly, everything was very good.
Saving in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happy to be in life"
Three men have "happy to be in life" after they were cut off from their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Return station held on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crow observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to smoke safe while their boat moved from their own power.
"We saw how the boat turned around their neighborhood and made us the worst," said the leader of the salvation station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Felfortunately, the strong winds have already shiped outside their reigned wide until we leave in the water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man was created in the age of 60 and found in a boi without a rescue.
They all came to the boat of the East Return Boat and were brought back to the safe station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were cast into the water have happiness and are still in life.
The boat engine, however, had been available on a nostalgion, was solved at the border of the boat from the person who struck the boat.
Someone's waiting for these men today.
Hard loss - a man stirred on his ex-friendine
A man attacked his ex-friendin in Hamburg-Harbourg with a mess, and heavily hurts.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to get his personal things.
Instead, the average of the alcoholized tattoo is the clothing of his ex-friendine.
When these came to the room, he stole them twice.
The 44-year-old age was lost in the hand and on the body.
The police could determine the killer.
While the 50-year-old was destroyed his ex-friendine, he called his mother.
This was alarmed on her sister.
The 45-year-old brothers wanted to be able to take care of their brother together with their lives.
But she couldn't move him to leave the room.
That's why she went out of the house with her lifemates.
On the street, they found the ex-leven-friend of the man's ex.
When the two women reached the room, the 50 - year - old sister raised his sister on the side and took his ex-friendine.
Who builds good rooms with braunschweigs?
The SPD and Green says: Investors must be more strengthened in the rights of the future.
How do you react to the bad message that braunschweig will lose almost 1300 good rooms in the next years?
The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a "Will Management Concept".
But war is programmed.
Firstly, it is about the question: Who will really build the good rooms?
There is no rules for a long time.
SPD Fraction President Christoph Bratmann says: "We are one with the Green: whoever wants to build in citizens must show 20 percent of all rooms as social apartments."
However, the good rooms can also exist in the file.
However, the great battle point in Rathaus is like Bratmann: "What are you going to be with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at at least 10 per cent of these areas, but may be 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new citizen staff funding program, which is costing millions and still needed to be financed, should be concerned.
The problem, so Bratmann: "There's no uniform between the fractions."
The CDU wants investors to make a few rules.
The link still wants severe records for investors.
Instead of that, like Bratmann, build a disappearance of the situation on the apartment market.
If the action concept is applied, it will be concerned for additional tasks in the building management.
More persons are required.
It's unknown if we get the powers.
However, the program is still not completely: because the new rooms around 1260 should be built without it.
But how do you like the loss of more than 1300 good rooms that will be promoted in the next years?
Only until 2020, there will be 500 rooms.
In order to prevent this, as the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now be buried from the city.
Furthermore, it should be considered that rooms should be returned to the price binding.
This is possible in the West City.
On one point, the problem was resolved.
Because in West City runs for the yearend period.
Round 1800 rooms can be brought back to the price binding for good rooms.
Only: This does not want the owners, the habitat building companys.
Because the number of social residences in the West City will be drastically increased, and it will be removed from the objective of the so-called dust.
A concentration of social weakness in only a few cities should not be given any more.
The Green assess that there is still a move in the discussion.
The Fraction President Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU has to be in the boat."
They have focused on more buildings for infamily homes.
But it doesn't mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a jagd after health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world has changed.
That teenager and children are not gone for playing anymore, but it is much more prefering to lose their free time to strengthen the screens in the last decade of many.
In Pokemon Go it is to take people from Sofa and let them be activers.
The time on the screen was started on the TV browser, then restricted video games and last on smartphones.
That is why it is great to see that technologies and activities are not excluded in freedom.
I am obvious to the Pokémon Go-Warn, a app that is attached to the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (and then there was a series of charts, game cards and other Spin-Offs).
How many phenomenons of the Population are the interest in the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was moved by the massive demand that the server was overloaded.
In a few days, Poquemon Go had more users than tinder and almost so many as Twitter.
How does it work?
Short says the players with their smartphones go out and look for pokemons who are followed with a GPS and when they were found, they can be taken "fotographed" (with a screencast on the phone) or "captures".
A generation that played the game, when she was younger, closed the wheel and shocked for the search of Sofa.
In the United States the game led to a significant growth to steps that returns the "traditional" person every day.
Cardiogram, a app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post shortly with that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of following people training each day 30 minutes from 45% to 53%.
The company doesn't know who of Pokemon Go plays - it sees only the roh-dates for the increase of training.
Many public declaration campaigns for health that people want to take 'that 30 minutes' time', "they come from Sofa" and "to be active every day" are thrown up to my ears, because many public messages are long-term and from people who look amazing.
However, the significance of sport cannot be evaluated.
He who is regularly sports reduces his chances to sick or depression.
Body integration helps to control the weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of provisions that are too long to carry them here.
But the wonderful in Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something free that makes them happy.
Thus, three columns of health will be covered - movement, fresh air and sun appearance and happy.
Some people shut up on the jagd even new friends.
As always there is a murical player who always needs to discuss something.
And yeah, somebody could run against a door.
What's going on?
It happened a break.
Even if Smartphone Apps like Fitbit had already been able to persecute our activities, they gave us no reason to travel sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its reiz and the use will be allowed by the time.
However, because of Pokemons success will be given more games to join the Apps and virtual reality with the active currencies in the real world, and many people will be helped to be active, fitter and healthy.

Simone Biles makes gold in the dameurne
Forget the pressure.
Forget the Hype.
Simone Biles is on all the immune.
Dynamically on the shooter.
It's on the boat.
Attempts on the ground.
On the whole line, brilliant.
And now, finally, also an olympian.
The 19-year-year American Turner was discovered on the Sunday to the Multi-Congress Title and increased the loudness between himself and the rest of the world before all the eyes under the olympical sight of the olympical games.
The total result of 62.198 was clearly before the Silver Medaille Winner and the Final Five Management Camera Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronzeedaille City of Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turn on the shoe bar during the single merchandise finals of women in art tours at the Olympical Sommer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Sunday.
Bales is the fourth theerosexual American, who wins a multi-conference title, and totally the fifth, while they set their call to be the best of their generation or even more.
She ran out in dreams when her final result was shown and her long journey found a end in this moment.
This success shows it in the same ligue as a single athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Billes the last three years has dominated her sportart, 15 World Master Medailles - including 10 gold medailles - with so amazing works that include a mixing of honor and presence that Mary Lou Retton of 1984 said that she was "the best tourner that I have ever seen."
She expected a last test in Brazil, a concurrence that was not so much between the Bales and the rest of the Athletes, but mostly between her and a last overdimensionated expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as a disaster.
The Americans Simone Biles, the left, and Aly Raisman smoke after they win gold and silver in the single sea box fingers of women in art tours in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Sunday, 2016
Billes took the first medaille on the Sunday, while she served in the department field of the human coordinator Martha Karolyi as a call mark.
Although Billes had been on it, while their long ways on the spitze, never have planned the future, it is not really true.
A part of their grounds - which contains their typical tumbling pass - is declined on Latin American music that would pass home outside the Olympiarana in Rio.
That's not an accident.
This girl who was trained by their grandparents as a small child, and the mother of Trainer Aimee Boorman's mother was discovered during a school fly in the Turnhall, in the Boorman, was forced.
She has no longer lost multi-concurrence competition since the Sunday 2013, a seed that will stop as long as Billes wants.
Even when the Mustafina leads easily through two rotations, the image was broken.
Switchbars and earthquakes - in which the world's master titles are low.
She retrieved with 15,433 on the board - and set with a 15,933 on the ground another one on the ground.
Raisman humbled her as they expected her final results - a pure formality - and trembling smoking on Biles green red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she first described in her collection book was real.
Raismans was a race for the last four years ago when she was fighting about the third place, but the Bronzemedaille went into a timber in Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-year-old-country, named by the American "Oma", was an advice.
After their grounds, she was raised to the public, overwhelmed by a comback, which sometimes appeared doubtally.
What Billes concerns, he has quickly expanded the 19-year-old two from the beginning of this week a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in series homicides at music hearing in the car
According to the police reports published on Sunday, two women and a 12-year-year girls were explored in one of the deadest attacks since one of the first decades of Phoenix's death, while they heard them in the car and music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were killed on June 12, while the car was parked in an income, the authorities said.
The shooter shooted eight shooters out of a handwave, while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police shared that the three-time murder was not the result of an accident, because the supplier did not take the handtaking or $2.900, which were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shipping officers had led the officers to be closer to see if she has been connected to four previous attacks.
Totally, in Spanish residents in four months in nine attacks, seven people were killed and two more hurts.
"It's happening in a worst front of a house," shared Howard of the KHPO, a daughter company of CBS, in the beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suddenly used several vehicles, including a braun Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The officers refused to open the evidence that they had carried out to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and had been made by the same murder.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and died later because of their losses.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died before the place.
One witness described the police that it was not incompatible for them to sit in a parking car and to listen to music.
The authorities also publish a police report on the shoes, which was on an empty pickup press a half-hour before the triple murder, and it is out of the fact that it was the work of the serian killer.
Hermittlers found patterns and saved a cup from the seat and cups from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old mother with microzephalie: "It's gonna be better"
Like most of the six-year-old Edmund Picciuto loves songs, games and, of course, his mother.
But as the least of his age were Edmund Microzephalie, the result of genetic disaster that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto had not known during her fault.
When he first came home, I was my first thought I didn't do that.
I don't do that.
Then I didn't let me go.
Whatever isn't true -- of course you've left it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were reported that Edmund will never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not survive once.
Some doctors were even so long as they proposed to institute him.
"My first answer was "I didn't know that people still do," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund couldn't sit down nor sit down until his third year of life, and he can't even talk.
But he makes long progress.
He can run with support and travelways.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund thought for "bye sing something for me."
"We bring him signs to him," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language -- she says, Edmund found some characters alone.
Microsephalie has a number of reasons: genetic like Edmund and infections with viruses such as mass or cycavirus during the disease.
The symptoms and prognoses can varie strongly.
It's too early to say how it affects the life of the infected cycavirus.
Picciuto reminds the emotional price of an unknown future.
I always asked what would happen?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know it yet.
I wasn't asking after the prognosis since long ago, because I didn't expect her to tell me someone really.
But Picciuto has made a hopeful advice for mothers of smoking with birth pains caused by the cycavirus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.

Because we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm supposed to be under the women's olympian society in Turn, and that's for more than one reason.
First, I was at every sommerolympide since 1984, and the United States were never so dominated.
And the second: this manage has three tourners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired for many young girls other hair colors.
The structure of this humanity, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, is, makes every honor.
This manage will finally spread against the United States.
It has confirmed the black and Spanish famous presence at the top of this sportart.
In the past four years, the number one was a African American.
The last year was Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last olympical games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising olympical winter and American.
Now the world was in the situation of the unbelieving ransom of the third world master Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but most gimastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, the heroesexual Americanian, who won in a individual multi-building process for women Gold.
Management member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We live the sports of this sport, but we don't see the tourists in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie kill all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the olympical team.
You are the "the last fifth" because the next Olympia community will only have four tourners in the marriage. It is the last year with Marta Karolyi as training.
But the reality seems that Turns are an urgent sport and Turners in first line in private tours, which will be maintained by parents, which will continue for training, training, traveling, concurrency and hotel costs (for trainers and their tourners and families). The list can continue to believe.
The majority of these tours are in a favorable foregrounds that can support the business.
In these United States, the Turners receive their whole training, and this is a hot and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both their athletes since they started with the tour.
We need to make the churches unless numbered, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more easier and easier accessible training.
I've based my tournament for 20 years.
In my events, we have ordered a non-country and significant tour in Harlem for more than 15,000 citizens (price of black and Spanish) and trained national and international guests.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (My hometown) to offer the younger high-quality tours, which provide the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympical sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and stability for the spirit.
This combination provides long-term benefits for health and for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this manner to bring thousands of young girls to interest for the tourn and that is great.
It's so important to share in the sport, especially for girls.
That's a funny time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real view of "Girl Power" through the wood of the Olympic Management Gold and thanks, thank you so much young girls with a different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful women.
Assistance forces want to organize further streets after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the war against the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the functioners of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 assistants who were abstind by a choice.
In July Hunt planned to introduce the Treaty immediately and said that the NHS had been in a "no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no."
The first assistance officers shall receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekly work to improve the obligations for unfortunate hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, the President of the BMA Committee for Assistant Management, shared last night in a communication with: "Assistors have been considered in the proposed Treaty as a serious consideration, especially that it has been attached to the current public crisis, and it will be absorbed to treat all doctors."
Only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract must be progressed and the time is running.
The efforts from the BMA to resolve conflicts through conversation are to participate in the government on resistance and sometimes to obstacle swallows.
That happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had done last month that his door would always be opened.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to do now to lift up the surrounding and address the worries of the assistance."
If he does not do this, the assistance officers have clearly made that they are ready to carry out further employment measures.
The last streek end of April saw a review of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 times, since hospital westerns and fabrics were inserted to ensure the doctors on the track posted detection.
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the war against changes by accepting the reformed Treaty with the functioners of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to be a better week-term party for the 54,000 assistance guarantees under the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director of the NHS cooperator, requested the assistant to finish the street.
Mortimer said: "Working adoptions have nothing of the only few, but they have already overloaded teams and services and prepare patients, employers and families only concern, concern and interruption."
In the past two months, we have spoken to the Commission of the Assistance Corporation and respond to the Health Ministry and other Ministers positively on the minds of the form and the whistleblowings.
The workers hoped that the positive commitment to other important issues - such as demission, flexibility in schools, additional schools for those who return from a professional time, education costs, adverse recognition of the teaching plan, training facilities and the physical employment in the medical cases - was a sign for the serious workers, the Health Education of England and the Health Minister of Health, and the Health Health of Health and the Health Minister of Health.
The £2 per Tag medicine that can show the heartfarcrytic
Thousands of heartfart patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities were recommended to provide more people for a longer period.
The renewable medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of the renewed heart market for persons with a heart disease.
The medicine will be reached for 12 months after a heartfarm, reducing the risk of a smoking accident or another heartfarm.
The NHS regulatory authority recommended a four-year-old adoption to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority recommended a four-year-old adoption to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people gain a heartfarm each year, and a fourth part of it brings another heartfarm or a smoking accident.
The cartridge and smoking accidents are caused by the collections of continuous materials in the artificial walls, which are designed by the collections.
If the skin is departed, it can cause a bloody insulin that hides the blood flow until the heart and causes a heartfarm.
When the blood insulin is sold, it can flow through the blood stream and hide the blood flow to the brain, which caused a smoking accident.
Persons who have already had a heartwarm are undertaking a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk, through the education of blood insulins.
The management design of NICE, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month income of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a double day income of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Transure of the disponibility of secondary prevention has been a fourth of all people who have received a heart market, another heartfarm or a smoking accident - often with the extreme consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart market may have significant negative effects on the quality of a person.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heartfarts and smooth accidents with people who had already a heartfart.
With a proceeding recommendation of Ticagrelor, we rejoice that we are in the ability to increase available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficiency and security of Ticagrelor - in particular the risk of blood - is limited to a period of to three years.
Political Correctness culture allows the choice in Muslim regions
The former citizen manager of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was remoted last year on a government report by corruption from the office.
A political Correctness culture has led to that widely extended choice in Muslim communities will be ignored scientificly as a broken government report today.
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been able to ignore the police, electronic officers and consistency in order to have evidence of choiceless use because of "the rebellions relating to Ethnie and Religion".
The previous Minister for Integration and Communal Government, which now is an anticorruption king, said that the oppression of choices from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be arrested to set a exploitors outside the choice cabins to protect injured choices.
He recommends that the choicer should bring an indication to prove their identity in the choice.
At the time, a choice must only call his name and address.
The report suggests that no remote tension is to put up on the finger of a person if it leaves their choice to prevent that someone has chosen twice.
Whistleblower should have more protection, says Sir Eric.
He requests the prices to have more access to joint companies and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"It's not only to the choice, but also to protect the community government from the larger corruption and financing culture that is involved in this," he said.
The report was adopted by the Downing Street as follows of the Tower Hamlet's electionkandals in East London.
Last year a special election judge decided that the officer of the citizens Lutfur Rahman should be removed after a Litania to corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The Court concluded that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in Cynical and ways" and that he had brought his critics with rassism and islamophobies.
Rahman should "her campaign has led on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."
Before 300 votes were doubtless or the consequences of a seal, when a person was chosen as someone else.
Sir Eric said that it was proved in all the country.
He was especially alarming to the employee letter selection - with the older members of the Muslim Community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, described, made several recommendations to build the selection system, including the foot of evidence to prove identity.
In his report it says: "Any evidence has been made that the pressure on the needed members of the Ethnic minorities has been issued, in particular women and young men, to choose, in accordance with the will of elders, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladesh Background.
"It was thought that... State institutions would have ignored such conduct because of the "political correction" consecutiveness in relation to the Ethnian and Religion."
Mr Eric said 50 recommendations to cut off the system, including the command that political active elections were edited to stop "Walters".
The report, which is raised by Theresa May, is also required more severe registration checks to prevent the choice of immigration and social consumption.
Choose options to ask the choice before you chooser.
Use no remote tits on the finger of a person when she left her voice to prevent someone's choice twice.
Systematic checks on nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year-year limit to requests to a automatic mail selection.
Promise that political activities edit full letter selections and transactions of letter selections.
The police gives the power to set up broadcasts for choice stations.
A legislative amendment that enhances an adoption in the respect of the representation of the People Act 1983 (Volk Restriction Height 1983).
Photographer prompt in choice stations.
The requirement that only English should be used in the choice stations (excluding Wales).
Intensity of training to ensure that cooperators implement the rule that the choicers only go into the choice.
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan police and finds it "respectable" that no strategy has been made after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election judge has explained Lutfur Rahman and his representative for Corrupt and illegal practices as untagly," he said.
He was recognized by a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal procedures.
He also criticizes the non-effective controls of the election registration sections of the Council Houses.
Mr Eric said, "The court in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal since the last year.
Our country is raised as the mother of Parliament, but the interesting and hidden expansion of choice and denyment of certain authorities have the good call.

One of the most favorable comparisons since London 2012 will be in the middle of this year: the extraordinary equality between the British Greg Rutherford and the favorite look player Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian Turner Aliya Mustafina with its big, strong eye should be able to travel as a double gainer for the Cuban American Cancer Gloria Estefan.

How to protect you with Crav Maga before weapons
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it something safe for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of Krav Maga Verbandes in New York to find how we were going to be close to the weapons of weapons.
Independently if you are closed to you from before or behind, you will show this video how you turn the skin for your rollers.
If you are close to you from behind, then you should turn yourself as the first, so you can see your caller and "shot out of the shopping line," says Mizrachi.
Take the weapons between your pre-guard and your shooter before you shoot him with your free albong in your face.
Then shoot him with the knee in the bowl, and shoot you, while the challenge is gathered before pain, the weapons out of his hands. Shoot him with the roll in the face and move back, while they judged the weapon on him.
In the shipping, the technology is similar to - move your body out of the shoe line, take the weapons and distract them, so that the supplier can't shoot.
Take the weight on the weapons in the same time and shoot the weapons on the brush, then shoot the weapons out of his hand before they move backwards and direct the weapons on him.
Does it sound hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.
But think that it's the most safe to get your money - if you don't be Klav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveling Ian Wright writes his tongue to the most severe countries of Europe
A British traveller submitted his immunity system and currency flexibility of a serious test - by cutting some of the most severe and most serious places of Europe.
The Moderator and Travel Author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk split his tongue on a euro-schein, a payer at Piccadilly Circus, a box of a togtoilette and a public phone in Russia to make the resistance of its immunsystems.
Before disappearing each object, he used a luminometer to show us what he will be put in.
But the experience made under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results on daylight.
The thinking that the bottom of a toilette that has already been used for thousands of others may be absolutely abstone, but actually there are more bad bakteries in a cocktail.
At his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of darmbateteria and his own health.
Happyly, nothing left that he struck, more than a worried dream in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance capacity of his darm by eating from the world, proper and wonderful things.
From public lands in boards to the toilet bottoms, the task made its immunity system definitively under a test.
In the movie he said, "I was a child, and I was relatively inquired of my health, and I had all the possible things in my mouth, the earth, the whirlwinds and the slammwater."
In the movie, he was justified by his call in every case.
The only thing he refused was a serious public toilette in Russia.
His test abstract showed a number of luminometers of over 4000 units.
In comparison with this, the number of luminometers of fresh smoking hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilette that he refused to decline after its number of luminometers arrived over 4000 units, while fresh hands showed less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the battery number in various places like the bathroom
In the film he says, "This comes to the worst thing I've walked in a toilette."
There's nothing more tougher than that!
I'm gonna get nothing here, because it's great in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of Milk Product Valio.
The company has Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains milk bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of darmbacteria and immune systems.
Valios Senor Venice President for Snacks, Snacks and New Category Niko Fuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
Something, which is fascinating to look at, and the same time explains the price of probiotics.
We brought crazy brainstormings that ended that we said, "Let us call Ian."
They mean that the interest of darm health is to be a global phenomenon.
Instead of speaking only about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bakteries in our alphabetic environment, the significance of dark health and how it is linked to the immunsystem.
The growing interest in the Dark Health is a global phenomenon, and we could provide more information on the consumers in a interesting way and way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense for humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the region of the film, added: "Let me say so - I had lost my respect for Ian if he had given some of the things I had given to lead to him, as the great Russian toilette that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things with which it was easier to bring Ian to get it and others with which it was very difficult.
I'm happy that we have taken some of these painful leckers on movie."
In a question of Valio from 2015 associated 84% of all demanded milk bacterias, especially with the property of magnes and darm and 58%, they said that they used at least locally products containing inserted milk bacteria.

The family is worried, and her call is also.
The couple had three sons who lived intermediately in the room and the police said that the terrorism that added the family was struggle with baseball shoes, inhabitants of residents, drug consumption, drug trafficking and excessive crying, fights and fucking challenges.

The delegation was inspired by gained neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.
One said, "They were worried about no one."
We lived 20 years near them and it was always worse.
The innumerable times we're telling the police here are incredible.
"Tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - that's not our lives!
Now where they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Houseing, stated that it had been committed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police was called in regular distances for 20 years
On the overwhelmed side of the community house, muscles and old games were cut down
He added: "It's a threat that it's the mystery to take every responsibility for their behavior and their family, because a delegation is always the last step, the Cornwall Houseing is in consideration.
It was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely extremely and their deeds for their neighbors were to be terrified.
I appreciate all my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and the members of the communities who have been able to access us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will be traveled to some neighbors and give the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons would live different times in the house, but they were all over 20.
A painful matratze left in one of the rooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Workers of the home management are now needed to remote municipalities that are around the house.
2014 the police led a razzo in the house and found over 70g Cannabis and Waagen, Paraphenaria and Bargeld in high of £1.700.
Skeldon received a piece of money after she had known the possession of a drug of class B in trade.
She said that the money for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon was, who came to a car accident in 2013.
After they were without obsession, Tanya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smoked with Graffiti.
The police says that it will be delegated with my delegation, which does not keep the budgetary agenda.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared that the delegation was a clear warning to the other officers who did not keep the budget.
"This is those who think that they can take themselves without self-production, and those who have been destroyed by such a condemnation," said they.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.

The leadership of the US Republicans is raised by massive concerns, also in traditional conservative contracts.
Presidentkandidat Donald Trump has now given the weakness of his election campaign in the previous Republic Hochburg Utah.

"We have several problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, which he requested to support in important contracts such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
While it was wrong reports about his candidate, he took again his known media shoes.
Republican Hochburgs
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.

Other Institutes see, however, not with the distance that is usually used for republican candidates in the Agreement.
As dangerous, Arizona and Georgia also applies.

And then, this will be "will be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, a long-term place."
He does nothing else than "to tell the truth."
If it is not rich for him at the end of the reasons of political correction, if it is okay, Trump continued.
Then I'll return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Partei Trump should have forced to stretch money to support his election fight, he should not present better review values.
Instead of this, you would like to take the candidates of the Republicans to the Congress of the Army stronger.
Olympia: Doping test trigger
The IOC wants to set a discipline committee on the case.
Kenias Leichtatletes went after the second Doping Affairs at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a trial at a doping control in the olympical village, Kenya sent a trainer to home.
The International Olympical Committee participated in order to establish a discipline committee to investigate the case.

Russ Lightatletes were excluded by the sommer games.
Salzburger "West Side History" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, Salzburg's feast games present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love park, such as Romeo and Julia.
This is a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A Musical built Salzburg: the "West Side History", Leonard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the Musical to the temple of the classic temple and filled himself with the role of Mary a young dream.
In the orchester grave, the Simon Bolivar Orchester in the direction of the Venezional Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of Rhythmus," he suffers.
We always say she's very late American.
There are many Latin American tattoos in their time and the melodie.
It's a wonderful mixing, the perfect recipe for our orchester.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this incentive, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the young Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her lip, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very painful.
"It's very like me, my Italian character I have as Romans," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of the lobby for the teacher: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's so honor to work with her.
She's an unbelievable man.
And Bartoli returns the complication: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very painful!"
The guidance is a need for him.
You see it in all his moves, in his face, it's his life!
It's so great chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a southern temperament, a fire, a suffering, and also a happy event of life, that is very important!
For the American Register Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly: "In this piece it's about preurity and fanatism."
Today, we have the flights, the Puertoricans have gone to New York, and the New Yorkers won't want them.
It's the same subjects, and they're exactly strong as today.
59 years later, the track is still relevant.

Treat wants neighbor calendar for "Free and for men"
The Treat Magazine works together with the photographer David Bellemere to carry out a 1970-year-old pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of pregnant naked people, they want to find the next generation of topmodels for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.

Turkey: Curdian communities calculated with mass flight
"Who doesn't apply and praise Erdogan, sit on packaged coffees," says the President of the Green Stepting dialog and the world, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdian community of Germany reviews a short time with ten thousand protectors who fled from Turkey to Germany.
Middle-time, it could also be "a few hundred thousand", believes the Al Toprak Conference President.
According to the severe progress of the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan after the Putsch Procurement, the Kurdian Community Germany expected a mass flow to Germany.
"I receiving a short time with ten thousands, mediterraneously with some hundred thousands of protectors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak of the "Welt" of the "Welt".
Since the Government has already overcome Kurdian Hochburgs with tractions, there are 500,000 courses within Turkey on the flight.
After the requested putch, there are still secular and optical ethnic tours.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be pressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a State that takes himself flights produced in its own country flights," said Toprak.
The Board of Verband declared the target of the Syrian Arabian in Kurdish, but also in German cities.
This would like to increase the expression on the remaining courses.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, Christian army and Greeks have already been cut off or lost in the past hundred years," said Toprak, which is also a member of CDU member.
The Conference Team requested that the Agreement Government would "as so serious as Austria against Erdogan and his additives."
In Germany, there is also a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan's critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months.
The German branch of yellow movement also fears the flight of many tours in the outside.
More tours are looking for asyl in Germany, especially the courses and oppositional.
The brandmarking as a gulden additor destroys teachers and other academys the professional existence.
"Who does not apply and loud Erdogan, sits on packaged coffees, even the chemicals and the seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, President of the Green Stepting dialogue and education, the "Well".
As the journal reported on the numbers of the Agency Ministry, the Turkeys have already submitted the greatest group of the asylums recognised in Germany by political persecution.
On Wednesday 30 June, these 11.386 people were and thus 29 per cent of all were as an asylumed recognition (39.625).
In this survey, the floods are not found before war, poverty, or perspectivelessness.
Asyl competents after the basis are exclusively political, so by the State party, individual persecutions.
Mecklenburg's Forpommers: "Go to where it is wounded"
Selfish Mecklenburg formers: Inheims don't get anything from the Sommer Wail War with - and the Uruguayers of North Riin Western Federation can not choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg's Forpommers, they have understanded.
2021 will not be reached directly at the end of the Sommerfery, but the Swiss Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn't seem slower than for a long time: Sommerfery, Hitze, and land-day choice - that's the matter.
The inhabitants to be convinced by the electioners are in the ground.
The majority of the people who are in the country are on usedom, rounds or hidden sea are not inside, so they can't choose the country day.
It comes to practical problems: In the distances there are helpers, attaching the plaquets, pulling airballs, distributing flowers, and at the end of the voice, just to arise.
Before the 4 September 2016, the election and the last pharmaceutical day, the Mecklenburg's forpowers need to be able to continue the election fight on the people.
The name phase, if you can say this, has just started.
And it is also about something: President Erwin Selering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, since 1998, is now clear to the CDU.
It's amazing how strong newling AfD is deceived and what remains at the end of the day of coalition.
Selering, 66 years old and since 2008 government team, makes a nearly inacceptable choice fight, looks out of his large place.
He walks through the country, divides roses and splits a little bit with the people, as well as he has already done his legendary advantages of Harald Ringstorff.
Furthermore, Seelering has reached cold feet and gives canzler marks the crime on the inheritance of the AfD.
Their flight policy, you "We create this" has concluded the extent of the legal popularists, which is likely to cost the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its shop canadians, the Inner Ministry Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make a false time on the right place of choice.
She has invited the Canzler Angela Markel to large urgences; Markel Bundestag selection cross is located in the north.
But the target group did not mean, there were more North Rin Westerns, Berliners and Saxen there as Mecklenburgers and Vorpommers.
"It was probably the most of the other contracts countries," wincent Kokert, the Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg's Forpommers, recently in NDR.
But there is no one of the other teeth of Germany to listen to Angela Markel.
Furthermore, the North-East CDU explores the normal choice campaigns on marketplaces and investment centres with sunscreen and airballs.
That, like cooker, just play a "subordinated role."
The Union also noted that you broke the base on the country that it must be very trying to find a road to people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Green: there is no longer in the way of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU Electioner Cockert on his assistant is also self-providing: "You must go to where it is going, where people are: Dorfeste, Golden Honey, each birthday room must be used."
Since a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a special inhabited choice fight.
The social democracies have recently launched 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and only pressed before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD was still clear with 35,6 per cent before the CDU (22).
The Green, small parties with seven per cent in the consultations, could be made to make the plane in the country day.
They make a modern currency from the remote note and disappear their choice fight greatly in the Internet.
"Online Wahl War", named Claudia Müller.
Furthermore, green choice fighters are intended to look for the exploitation of a single vote citizens among the officers.
Silke Gajek, the Spitze Candidatin, just curve with a home boat through the Mecklenburg Sea and finds it still beautiful.
Your impression is: "Wellurf in the Mecklenburg's Forpommers is not a crime."
B27-Sanage: Gast Citys are disappeared
There is nothing to mecker in the speed with the B 27.
For the responsibilities of the building works starting at 5:30 tomorrow and at least at 20 hours, there is all reasons for honor.
"They have done all very amazing," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet tank.
That's a Super team.
There's no move.
The builder could be planned to south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October will be completed.
It will also be responsible for the construction works, even if it is for the establishment of help investments.
Since the construction was changed in the Monday to south, and the breaking of the asperg streets was also held in ranges, and the connection to Rottenburg is reached again, the transport was deprived within the place.
The citizens can now be able to retract both of the B 27 districts.
The traveling seems to go back through the location.
"There was partly significant convictions," says the manager Florian King for the transportal management of the sanction responsible.
The inhabitants of bachset streets, stone streets, hafner streets and winter railways had to fight with more transport layers because many travelways were searched and trusted in their vagina than the decrease.
What happened to the fact that some Lkw were divorced in habitat areas.
Since the speed limits were not held, the community requested to strengthen the measuring vehicle from mistakes.
"It's been a serious crime," said the King, who made himself known on the situation.
There are two to three per minute.
The fastest was walking with 77 kilometres in the time-30-zone.
Since the building has gone, it's been quiet.
For the business leaders in the B 27, it is only a small suffering that for customers from Rottenburg now the street is open.
In the cards, you don't like business leaders.
But that the B's 27-station has led with them to a breakfast, let everyone who asks.
However, some are more and some are less involved.
The one who has less to do with the "endcoding", so for other companies, has no consequences for the saining.
Moreover in the Maier house, Thomas Sulz says about a "the highest lighter back", but also dreams that, of course, "the driving company is missing."
In the most strongest story, the locals are on the street.
J. Albert Gohnner, the container of the Steakhouse, first crone, finds clear words.
It's already existing.
Not only him, but all the guests have found it "hard".
It was missing the customers from heching, Ballen and Rootweil.
We must be happy for each euro.
The investment is increasingly "length of 50 percent".
The road sale has been "in two years back."
The half of his cooperators has to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 cooperators and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President of the Government Jörg Schmidt has reviewed a question of goods, whether it could give a financial comparison with the indication, the guests in other cases of the situation at the B 27. Now, they also need to take the nights that have been held by the sanction.
The rewarder knows other landscapes where something has been treated so greater.
In all cases, the rewards are sure that its hostels will continue.
Finally, the family operation has already been held here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
It can understand that other stage officers are now in the case of the complicated transport length often.
If you can't get out, it's also a good place.
That his stage client returns back after the end of the sanction work, it has no doubt.
Instead of the crises with BSE and Vogelgrippe, Guys have the effects of the B 27 bubble works on their knowledge for the greatest crisis that has lived his hostels in their long-year history.
Six months of building work, that's already brutal.
In the name of the terrorism fighting of laws is permanently struggled.
After the recent advice, the Inner Ministry of Maizière now provides a tick security package.
But what's going to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reward.
All its proposals are the coalition partner "politically comprehensible," says the Minister of Agency at the presentation of its new security package.
They don't ask anyone.
Other, continuing points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also part of that.
But as the Minister of Interior, he has been in the results and on a "objective consensus" within the coalition.
The Maizière has launched a little time after the latest proposals in Würzburg and attorney before he presents its conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now they're going to be more fierce.
Some are already known, reported, attached: This is not new that a new security authority should take care of the kids encrypted communications is not new.
It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU organisations to airport data and weapons.
The call for more video monitoring and personal for security authorities is also not surprised.
In part, the Maizière starts a second invitation for proposals that have not been made with the SPD: He wants to make sympathies for terrorist groups under crimes and dyshadians with a double citizenship of German pass.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-Mann grabs.
He still keeps this for persuadable, and does not ask anything to coalition partners without any chance.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They are partly in themselves: He plans rapid procedures for displacements and more opportunities to arrest humans before movement.
Flights that are achieved in the country should first check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some more worse than for a long time - even those who do crimes or take their papers to deal with their identity.
Some of them are political and rightly heavy.
Some are still disappeared and opening questions.
And in some points - for example, in the unlike treatment of patients - is the question: What is it really to do with security and terror?
Yes, the Maizière says that it is important to distinguish between the plans of flying and terror.
But it is not able to believe that the attentives of Ansbach and Würzburg were flights.
Moreover, many people were worried about the high-flight payment for security.
And things that the people were hardly occupied, have not been discovered in election wartimes.
The internal security is greatly pressed in the focus.
First of the proposals in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nizza.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and the attacks.
Insurance is great.
And yes, it's going to fight choice.
The Union and the SPD are therefore attached to the subject of the internal security.
In the past days, it was high between the two parties.
First, a serious war against the establishment of the Budget Police, then on a security policy collection of some Union officers, where the residence officers also require a Burk's contract and a turn from the double citizenship.
The Maizière can also be here for a regular sound.
He didn't have anything from a duple pass from a department.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Rebuild them, don't be wise.
And at a Burka-promise, he has a reasonable legal mind.
Whether its own package is raised at all branches, and if it actually is "fortunate" for coalition partners, it must only be shown.
It's stealing in some ways that could be worried for the battle.
However, the SPD is also trying to profile themselves in the subject of the internal security.
Participant Sigmar Gabriel signals only aware of conversation and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is important to increase security."
There's still people's cars.
However, these candals increase the distribution numbers in the world.
However, it does not run around all markets.
In the revocation, there is a weight for a term.
People's cars started during the second half-year training training.
The greatest car building of Europe can be further demonstrated in the past year's past, although this ships are in thanks to its many markets and some of the good running markets.
However, in July, the VW carried out in particular in West Europe and reloaded the total selling, as it reported in the Dax.
In the world, the VW mark was sold in July with 449100 cars 1,8 percent less cars than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, to China the two-which market, the vending was 14 per cent under the previous month.
In the housemarkt Germany, the expenditures were at least a seal.
Market distribution team Jürgen Stackmann brought the weak numbers from July, in particular, at less than two days in Europe.
Also, in some nuclear markets, it has been retained by the "modified economic framework conditions".
Besides the situation around the putch test in Turkey, the British Votum has also carried out of the EU, a speaker explained.
In the U.S., where the abuse first scalated, there is also a minus of book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the main market of the low-sheets has been continuously driving by the Ceel Canal: On the first seven months, only a driving-minus of 0,9 per cent to 3,37 million carriers to book.
Concerning distribution team Fred Kapler could further provide a sale place from January to July.
1,3 per cent of more vehicles delivered people cars in this time, around the world 5,904 million.
People's car was manipulated with a software abstract test.
Only in Germany, VW calls around 2,5 million cars to desolation in work towns.
The VW forced that the construction of the cars has no negative effects.
After the construction of vehicles, the consumption of carriers, CO2 emissions or carriers is not provided.
The autobuilding makes the customers a "garantie equal" confirmation, but it doesn't speak of a "garantie", as it was called on free day in enterprises.
The reason is legal enemies.
The "Focus" reported that the people cars delivered his German customers now a guarantee for the surrounded diel model.
This would be confirmed last monthly VW representative in the Treaty Ministry.
From the Transport Minister was confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fulfil the records of my research Commission and the KBA."
"The differences of this are not accepted," stated Mr. Alexander Doulindt (CSU) by the Ministry.
VW has concluded that in consumption, CO2 emissions or carriers after the discharge of discharge, none of losses have been found and all type-approved vehicle values have unchanged.
Volkswagen himself uses the term "Garantie" as it was called in enterprises.
In the meaning "Garantie", people cars see the possibility that customers, for example, a half year after the disaster, may come to a motor chain in a workplace - and they may bring it back to the new software, even if the worst has nothing to do so.
Even in customer interest, it is important to prevent that, in some other disasters that have nothing to do with the gas canal, there is an insurance in respect of possible ensure regulations as it was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "Garantie".
The raffine bank Gmund in the Tegern See requires rich spheres in future crimes - as the second Institute in Germany.
Bankchef Josef Paul said on Sunday, "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Day Accounts."
The Contracting Banks of German banks says of a single case and does not see any signal in it: Normal Sparer must not be afraid to pay for their Spargross crimes.
The banks of money in the European Central Bank (ECB) must pay 0.4 per cent of crimes.
This payment requires the raffie bank Gmund from September of private and company accounts for income over 100,000 euros on Giro or Day Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros in the year," said Paul.
He has seen 40 million euros since a period of time, which could be taken from one day to others, and that he can't assume.
"Thes are with me on the central bank county and caused 0.4 per cent cost," said the bank chef.
"I can't add 4000 euros for each million."
He gives the costs according to the principle of the prosecutor.
It would be very dangerous to leave the bars in the treasures of the raffy bank, "I have already experienced four accidents, I don't want the fifth!", said the Bank's proposal.
Most customers had understanding and changed in other forms.
Just a few switched to other banks.
The ECB's extreme money policy curses in all the banks were declared by the Communities of Bayern.
It is only to take it, if it is, "effectively unable."
Some German banks therefore increase their payments for accounting, credit cards or reviews.
Thiringer peoples and raffine banks of Altenburg with their Skatbank-Filial 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the principal employer of the bank contract, said, "We don't expect that private customs should pay payments for income, the concurrence in Germany is too strong in the banks and scarkases."
A banker said that it was "a client that has been issued something more worthy."
"This can be for a small bank to a problem," if she takes a lot of money.
The 1911 genocide bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach Egern, Kreuth and Tegern See.
In the region, known sports, and employees live in the region.
The Connaissance Connaissance Bayern, "No more banks who calculate an expenditure for investments of private customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
The President of the Contracting Board of German people banks and Raffee Banks (BVR), your joyful, had explained, "The smoke to go into the negative against the private account is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it has caused the degradation of students to concurrence.
The customers in Germany will not be attached to the width.
Destination Platts: Who really buys shoes?
One man's middle age loves platts.
Before you go to the comment part to override it under the Pseudonym NonAllAllAllMensMittlerenAlters with red facilities, this exhibition is declined from the present data.
According to YouGov, the multiproported raising of shoes is not to a tree in thousands of people who want to welcome the newness of physical circumstances, but to return to Middlife Nostalgie.
Those who have bought shortly a plate are all previews between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buying group.
There is also no horses by Hobby Sammlers - there is an emotional meaning: older plattforms keep their feelings better for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to solve the time (69 % in 66%).
But the results of YouGov?
If this blog had a message report in the TV, the camera would follow me, while I was running in a employed road in Soho, traveling a very deep room, and loose before I stayed, my hands stopped and said something significantly like, "So, let us take a close look at it."
So let's get a look on it.
Even if the heart of Sohos is late in his charme - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filled with the buildings in which one independent soldiers were attached - there is like a manually fantastic plastic business.
I would like to ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part, where I am directly nearly close to different men in such businesses and try to take care of their age and age.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed by sister Ray (Data number: two young women, three men middle age) in Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably 20), is a long day because of a meeting in London and go through the business to fill the couple of hours.
He's a Sammler, do I ask?
"I appreciate," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 platts.
These shoes boards, on the top, (he sent me the snippet by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his room.
The reason why he has such a significant number of albs and Singles is the result of his available income: he is now in the ability to buy platts that he couldn't reach when they appeared and reached the areas he sold when he was young and lonely.
"A lot of things I'm buying is from the late 60s, former 70, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Some things I probably was too young to buy them to me," he said.
He is true that those who buy the platts that are more introverted and enjoy solemn time, and adds: "I don't smile and I don't drink much.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25 who works with sister Ray also believes that many customers that he tried to contact the YouGoov profile.
However, he also observed a new weight on people affected by the mediahpe, people who have heard about the comback and have seen to buy their old plastics again.
From the conversations I have led, people have regularly made their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the additives of the Platt Revival of a certain age.
But what about the additive emotional meaning of platts?
It is only a few seconds in a business such as Fhonica to recognize that plattforms provide a comprehensive community of equality.
According to Wetz, some of the older customers have received an accommodation on the non-contact payment system.
Some plattenfans feel avoided from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of trusted shoes, from circumstances that have been called happy young reminders.
"I think sometimes it can be the full of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of pleasure," says Wez.
It's a Sammler with me, and I think it's a lot of people.
It's a simple way to work hardly.
"We're like their social workers!", a co-operator rolls out from a plattform.
A review of the ICM in April concluded that at least 50% of the people who buyed a plate last month, they haven't been attached.
The question also found that 41% of a platform player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate does not have any plate player.
At this time of the message report, I would like to look very worried, while I had a stap in Bossa Nova compilation.
Johnny, 42, who worked at Sounds of the Universe (Daten number: Middle age), has noted a "Tropheenaspect" of the Revival.
"Anyone came just in here shortly, and said, "I have no plastic player, but I would like to buy a radiohead shoeboard so I can put them into the real estate," he said.
This is not a great percentage, but it's going to happen definitively.
More products, less musical.
We have people who say, "I have no player."
These are younger people, not older ones who just come in.
Fop, which almost entirely cut off the ball platts, has been a lower public than I'm cleaning.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women in the middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is a little lesser than in the present businesses - Wild Beasts' newest synthesizer and sex-packer pop instead of experimental jazz plays out of the sound talkers - it is good to see such differences with the customers.
No one of them looks unique, but the next psychic dreams are hard if you are at least 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, runs for a few minutes in the business and considers the variability of the plates to sell.
She makes a bunch of stereo bulls than a big bunch.
She doesn't pay much, so the collection of Platten is no real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or on another way and way, but the beauty of platts is..." she's departing with a loved shooter.
I don't know how to explain it -- it's really unique.
My last challenge is a business that is said that a new generation of plastic livings should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I gave the advice to show the Jeans-hotpants, I observed a group of young teenagers who grouped themselves for a moment on the polar cameras, before a father and his daughter came to buy a Crosley Plattform player.
On the left, a wall of a full place of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixing of time-week music and classics, the essential places for a average collection.
Nobody looks at it - maybe because they're just clean decorative, some so lowerly that it's impossible to touch them.
It's clean "Plattenkunst".
But in view of that each attraction for these circumstances means more money for the branch and some customers could send in the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to be struggled.
There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who gives most for Luxembourg states like platts.
Even if my researchs have received that the results of YouGov are voted, they will, at least, in Plattforms in Soho, not consider the large number of rooms and plattforms that exist in reality, plattforms and online works.
These people are probably working hard in school or offices.
They can't spend their Sunday tomorrow with security with the bumble through the Berwick Street Plattforms and the boards through Platts, while they meet the worst view of a 30-year-year-old false moderator, who doesn't surround about the sculptors of the middle-year-old men.
The Greenlandhai is the longest wind - video report
Scientifics say that the Greenlandhai has the length of life of all wireless aircrafts on the planet.
Julius Nillen, the Haie, says that the record was at a woman, from which it's gone between 272 and 52 and 512 meters old and five meters.
The French Court provides an offer on the absence of businesses in Dschungl Airports
A French Court rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais, a thousand of provissory businesses and restaurants in the chair of Calais, in the thousands of fleeters.
In a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais were argued that the State should be able to reduce 72 provisional businesses in those persons within the stocks, from Zigaretts to Energy, selling, offering fresh services or tee for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simply sales for a few euros in provincial restaurants.
The prefect Calais argumented that these places should be deprived because they would have a parallel economy from which they would not be paid and that they would be able to make a fire- and health risk.
Humanitarian groups participated in the Court that businesses and restaurants were important, because the uncountry periods offered by the State supported association and other groups would not be sufficient food for growing numbers in the board.
They made it out that the provisional businesses and restaurants often would be offered for people in novel.
A Court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the demonstration of people who were involved in 72 provisorial businesses, but it concluded that the thoughts of the prefector of Calais were "absolutely completely able."
The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food businesses, the Cafés and Restaurants would play a lot of greater role than only to consider people who are "living in extreme pressure conditions".
He said that the areas offer peaceful traveling points between flights and freedoms.
One of the locations that were broken by the low river was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe of the laser, which is commonly operated, and offers 200 miles on the day, English and French classs, and a consultation of asylshops for hundreds of protective, uncompanied minor years in the board.
More than 170,000 people have signed the Petition to make the kids' coffee.
In a letter to the Guardian stated that the cluster "for these children would be a catastrophe from which the last eight years are old."
The two assistance organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated freely that the number of lives in the Dschunglight had been attached to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after an increase of new collections in the sommer.
Although Olympia Destruction: Martin remains fighterical

Here's the Enforcement Trailer
The German Raser must be set up to the next generation of speed: in various countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new blonde equipment will be carried out, especially the timers should be transmitted effectively.
The futuristic efficiency trailers of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden may, for example, be used at accidents, where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, for example, for autocars or driving pressure with a transit time limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to care with a stational sticker for the maintenance of the speed limit.
However, a permanent mobile building can be dangerous or urgent.
The effort Trailer trailer is autark: His axis takes five days in uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data will be encrypted through a modem.
The laser messenchnic can also be considered in the same time all vehicles on several shoes.
Variable speed limits and traveling provisions after time, vehicle traveling and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In a higher state, you can move the annexer as a manufacturer with each car with an additive compound.
In order to not just be deceived, he is deceived in the measuring industry so that the roads are lost in the panzered and the rest of the safe foreign rooms.
Furthermore, an embedded alarm warning should protect the briser before Vandalismus.
Since 2015, the trailer has been used by Vitronic data in various contract countries and has also been used mid-termly.
In addition, the outland authorities have been able to take place with the new technology: Junger has ordered 100 pieces in France, after a construction of 150 pieces in the past year.
Great Britain takes silver in the 7th rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold
The impressive rate of the Great Britain at the 7th Rugby was at the end on the Sunday evening at the last heat in the form of the Fijis, when they were struck in a result of 43-7 in Goddoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in action, side-stepping, pressure, line rolling and round power to win gold - its first olympian medale every color.
The deadline was broken by the not very bad suffering price of the silvermedaille - the fourth day of the Great Britain - and they could be able to be fierce in this Turnier, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The detailed reduction of the books, 7-5 in the half-final on the same day could be turned back on them in the end.
But independently, Fiji had made a 15-man team in best form.
It may be a pleasure for GB - but it's probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medale about his hair: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
It's just one of them here.
This slope is weak, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and made the GBs attacks out of spass.
It was feeling for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in the passenger buss. The World Series wingers went up to 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau traveled in the edge.
With four minutes, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right east he turned.
12-0 and GB have almost been attached to the ball.
An exciting tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but Fiji just stopped.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua was a touchdown in the right east and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new from the refrigerator, and it was still about a minute time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravuwa ran out by another low tackling of the GB team and struck up to line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.
It's like Fiji was born to play 7 while GB still learns it.
That's it.
GB led fundamental changes to half time, and closed the fijian smoking... for four minutes, which was good for the relations of the first half time until Josua Tuisova passed through a brilliant range of Fiji.
Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left equation for a 36-7, but the game has already passed longer for the south-shirt-shirts, whose fans canceled, hungry and danced on the tribs.
It wasn't hard to surprise the player's approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame set the i-buffers with another test in the last seconds.
The Pfiff said, the fijis smoked themselves, and GB kicked destroyed in the races.
Previously on the day, Fiji Japan was visited in half-final with 20-5, and the United Kingdom threw up South Africa in a half-finalmatch button from the river - the British Transformation of the Difference.
Kyle Brown brought the books in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive football work and made a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant tackling of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, saved the wine - and so the silvermedaille.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the crowd of the trainer to the road
It's not going to give an emotional gold as in these games and that's what's called.
From the first road to the last, 220 hard holes entering in the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their gold moment at Station da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two sitting on the road, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of the Trainer Robin Williams, was separately as they were calling to the second olympianold in the second without a sport, the first women in the history of the British Sports, who put such a measure table.
Her dominianity was absolutely, although her 39th unlaided use, which is also unexempled.
What we see are two brilliant athletins that lead on the surface with the elegance of swain, which does not resist the type of triumph to guests.
Before every gold in the road, a Battlelon has contributed to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was no helper than the trainer who didn't know whether he would survive this day more than he was diagnosed with him.
As he said he was a risk.
I had a blanch, which is operating, and they did it.
If you don't do that, he's going to get out of all.
It would be a very bad situation.
It changes a little the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio had happy that he had been treatment in the beginning of 2014, outside the saison, could begin what the interruption had been maintained at a minimum, if this is most of the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go back soon.
It was a reception.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
So it starts.
The ruder is already an exemption, but it makes it to a further increase.
In the immediateness of the wedding, their first thoughts on Williams, who had been a nervous morning to speak more than others and tried to treat his own affliction.
Stanning, who was a headman in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a use in Afghanistan, said, "I was this week a emotional crack. Maybe this is something extreme, but it means so much."
It's just again how much that means how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be no one, so it's a massive thanks to him, he's the best trainer of the world.
I couldn't want a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the past five years.
The couple had a hard rhythmus who couldn't maintain their hands.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started starting from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover were too in reserve.
We were very captured at the moment.
Helen called "blit in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to not let down.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't have to do something nice.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the wine that we did.
The Party will take a time for a year before it takes decisions about its future.
Glover needs to appear next week at a wedding time, their own with the TV advocator Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that that was my last train.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it ended about six months to understand that I am an olympian.
It was all so new for me and I was so scared.
Here's about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 Years performed for clarity
Ruppert Göller, the manager of the Waterweckband 'Fivestein Group', is in the rest.
The connection is applied as "byen-out for example".
A small french drinking water wheel band as a shape for the large water products.
So it was mentioned a few times ago in the originalton in a contribution to the Bayerian Round Function.
The water forum of the Government of sub-fractures would be able to achieve the purpose.
The work of the fifty stone group applied "byers long as formal."
Besides all of this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the employer of the employee, from 28 years as employer.
Now, he was disappointed in the rest of 65 years.
The drinking water steel band of the fifteen stone group with sitting in Cottendorf, the community of widebruns, promotes annually 150000 cubic meters of water and offers 32 places and weapons with about 5500 inhabitants.
The members of the churches are the churches, the breathbruns, the lauters, the Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For additional cities and communities there are water delivery contracts.
The current president, the Britbrunns citizen Gertrud Böl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller 1985 was set as waterwater, and was named for 1988 to the officer of the Dutch Conference.
"Their tasks have been very much, and they have stretched themselves from the water driver and maintenance works on offices and organizations, budget planning, calculation of payments and contributions until weekly requirements," said the President.
As an extraordinary event, it was called the introduction and the introduction of the new branches (1994), the basic purchases in the area of the new branches (1998) and the debatement of the agricultures, the sanction of higher holders (1999), the rebuilding of a central computer control (2004) and the party renewings of water guidelines.
It has not been given any silence, and you have always taken new renews, because water is life and drink water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Godlers to be faithful, lost and correct service for more than 31 years.
He has been used with a lot of heartblood for his water-weapon and has lived regularly on the water-free band as if it would be his own company.
However, a few weeks ago, as a practicer, he could present the success of the fifty stone group for nitrate concentration before the water forum of the underfractions of the circle.
He has received a lot of recognition and honor for that.
Rupert Göller on his side loud waterwarts Alfons Griebel, who has worked 28 years with him.
He's the best waterwater and he was a faithful kid.
We were together a disappointable team.
As high points out of his view, he marked the brown building and the restructuring of the target.
The biggest requirement and the hardest use was, but the road breach at the high-boarders at the church-lauters at the 3th January.
Here, at least 17 degrees, we need to work throughout the night to be able to achieve waters.
In addition, the refugee of newbruns can only be held once because you filled the high boxer of the pocket town with shirts.
The business execution of the drinkwater library was delivered to Daniel Stürmer from lauter, which follows Rupert Göller.
The Sopranistin Anna Netrebko is open with the Autism of his son Tiago - and returns to other involved parents: "You must have the strength to talk about."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian journal "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she must die.
The eight-year Tiago has come well before and now learn privately in New York, where the best therapeuts are given.
"To give a example, if I ask him what two years returns when I lie to the Mailman Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the most happy man on earth.
Tiago is from Netrebkos connected to the Bassbaritton Erwin Schrott.
She's married with the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargnesse - Man shoots lifefriend
A 35-year-old man shoot his partner in a multi-family house in Bargtenesse (Kreis Stormarn) at the freeday at 10:45.
"The man has called himself with us, and has indicated that his life-friend's brother has been struck," said a police speaker.
The killer is on the flight, and it will be published after him.
It's a lot of time, because Sven S. may have been walking with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters large, musculus, burning, and has a glass.
At least the police has published a photo from him.
However, it's a few years old.
In the middle of the man takes a glass.
The man should not be spoken directly.
He could still take the weapons, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S., the 110 calls.
The police says about a "relation state".
The victim was the year 1988, the killer of 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck, first, didn't want to make any data on the shipping or the relationship between killers and victims, but she confirmed that a man was killed.
"It's a killer."
"Now we don't say," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
The eyes were following a special command (SEC) on the Tatort.
Stahl - light view for German staff industry
The crisis and energy intensive German stage industry remains from additional costs in millions of high.
Financial loads that carried out the ecostrom contribution are from the table.
In the absence of the renewable energy energy environment in the materials for the same ownership production in the German stage industry, Mr. Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German German general period" (WAZ, free output).
"I am really happy about that we could finally achieve this after two years."
The European Commission first planned the staff manufacturers to use the gas from the hochofen for the electricity production for its own consumption to ask for the box.
The steel industry took additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the information of the Germany's broadband.
Gabriel said the WAZ that it now gives a principle unit with the EU Commission after talking with the competitive co-missager Margrethe Vestager.
Firstly, when generators are replaced in the stairs, an EEA environment is 20%.
But this will not be highlighted in the steel industry.
The IG metal welcomed the entity of Germany with the EU Commission for owner-strom production.
The status Quo of the previous regulation shall be increasingly described.
Special importance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the staff industry.
"In view of our campaign 'Stail is the future' is a first step."
"The others need to follow."
"In the reform of the emission law, the climate and employment objectives are also declined," explained IG Metal-head Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel branches in Europe are worthy of the financial crisis 2008 under overcapacities and a significant price pressure.
In the past year, the situation continued when the world's largest producer country of China was raised in view of the weakest home demands on the world market.
European manufacturers will prevent the price dumping of Chinese staff concerts.
During this morning, the situation has been amazing.
For a demonstrated import targets on import steel effect, the economic views in China have been held.
It's not clear how sustainable the price treatment is.
The German branch pressus thyssen group remained careful on Sunday.
Finally, the prices would have re-stagnised.
The branch reacts to the difficult situation with additional costs.
Thysen group also wanted to be exclusive of the clusters of individual works.
In German stage industry, about 80,000 people were employed in the end of 2015.
In July, German staff manufacturers remain careful, although increased prices and advantages.
They were produced with 3,4 million tonnes more than six percent of raw steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Agreement has reported on free day.
After a short upgrade in May, the producted quantity now returned the second month behind each other.
Since the beginning of the year, the production is about two percent under the previous year.
The license shall be calculated in the next months through a better task with a increased expenditure.
Communities, Spirit, Health: Make Seniors good
The song of Ursel Kipp has already joined her whole life: When a young girl was in school, she was in the school studio, she spent the music, and today sings the 78 years old in an older core.
"Sing moves me - emotional and body," she describes.
After a test, she feels likely, happy and all living, she says.
At the same time, they do something good in their health and their spirit.
Because Singen is equal to a great hobby for Seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most elders can sing in the core and share the joy in the music, describes Hackler.
By regular meetings, elders can cut and fix social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are resolved in the age, a core is a ideal opportunity to spend time with others.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her core: "It is a very special form of counsel."
Songs can be courageous in positive meaning, Hackler.
Because the Seniors train a deep and controlled atmosphere.
Whoever requests regularly his length, he doesn't get so fast from the puss.
Even if it's going to get the voice of the age, it's a optimal hobby.
For older people, the Sing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Treaty Community of the senior organizations.
In the older generations, the common song had a lot of higher position value, which was all day, even in school and in the free time, explains it.
Lenz often observes that the song or hearing of songs in older people have many reminders, often connected with positive feelings of their youth time.
By singing texts and especially melodies, people who have been declined with long-term events separate themselves.
In singing, the head is also required for a special expenditure, explains Lenz.
As soon as to concentrate on your own voice and a given rhythmus, and to adapt to other songs - this is a great cognitive requirement.
Moreover, older people who live alone do not only focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you get through the song in Chor, Hackler.
A remarkable public is a great lob.
The feeling of self-value is also growing by the song in core.
Take to show yourself: If I'm long for something, I'll be better and grow out of me - strengthen this experience.
Good reasons to start with the song, so there is enough.
Whoever wants to test a new hobby, should not touch - even if he means to have a little talent, let's get Lenz.
You can't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes?
At the search of the appropriate offer, Seniors have different opportunities, says Hackler.
If someone feels of the known cross in a senior officer, you can just make it easy.
Many cities also provide overviews on the Cleve in the environment.
He who wants to sing in a church core can directly turn to the church or the church's primary.
A lot of old schools are also found on the Internet.
Whoever doesn’t have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors to help the Internet research.
Whoever loves to sing, should be able to take a cold, crackler.
Sing makes the soul good and has something free - that is applied to every age.
Kats reage sensitiver than the cater on the board of the young animals
Biology studied in Hannover, which effect has the call of catenbabys on adult animals.
In their surprise, the Miauen also left the men not cold - however, they had always seen themselves in the difference with women.
Women cats can recognize the rate of catenbabys at Miauen of the small.
They react to ten percent quickly at the volume of kitchens who have considered in great concern, such as scientists from the Animal High School and the Medical High School Hannover (MH).
Cater also reacts to the call of kitchen - however, it is always the same.
"Obviously, the akustical differences between the Miau of less and strong joints for men or not true or not significant," said the Biology Widbke Conerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published in the Fach magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team has already discovered that the duration and the height of the kitchen cross was distinguished with the sustainability of their aid needs.
Observed were totally nine adult chats and eight chats from the MHH animal treatment.
They were played to a call of small, which was taken for three minutes from the wurfbox and was separated from mother and sisters.
To others, they were confronted with crying of stronger excited kitchens that were additionally higher.
Researchers keep their results instead of the low steel test for excessive power.
"All women, even those who had not yet their own visits, reacted differently on the scream," said Conerding.
They turned faster to the sound speaker when this call played the very excited kiss.
This possibility may be born or developed with the family.
"A surprise was that the men have reacted very well," said the biology.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on Babygirls.
In addition, some studies showed that women were sensitively responsible to smoking, even if they were already mothers or not, the Biology Marina Scheumn reported.
Podolski relates to "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sukür is a football league in Turkey.
In Turkey, the single football Hakan Sükür has been accepted an emergency command.
He will be proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
First after the putch test, there is a important football game in Turkey.
Before the Duell of the Erzrivals between Istanbul and Lucas Podolski Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Conya, the official line is indicated: "Business as usual".
Although the Government had not to be encouraging the whole day of normal citizens, although the exemption of the exemption state in July, the Government has not to be encouraging.
However, this does not apply to those who are deceived to listen to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulf that you are responsible for the push.
It will not be held before the football.
According to the previous Starkkicker Hakan Sükür, the State government made a challenge command.
However, it will be proposed to be a member of a terrorist group in the middle of America.
Sükür shall be the adjoint of the preacher Fethullah Golf, which is responsible for the Putch Reep Tayip Erdogan President.
Although the first status of exception is applied for 90 days until October, it actually has the life of most tours, but it is so good as no effects.
The nearly "Democracy Wars" on public places in the whole country Erdogan has explained at the middle of the end.
The sport is - as the entire country - placed in alongers and agencies of Erdogans.
Especially, the fans of the Working Club are not traditionally counted to the friends of the President.
However, what the growth of the Turks, regarding dramatic experiences in the history, is the stretch of military pups.
There are even the fans, even if their heart is smoking for Galatasaray or Visittas.
In the pokalsyger "Gala" it will be reached to Lukas Podolski.
His sport value set the collar in the cut off saison under evidence: With 17 gates and nine models in all competition, the 31-year-old age ended his first game time as topscorer of his convention.
At the end of the game against the Fenerbahce, he obtained the 1:0 rows.
The magazine "Fanatic" threatened him, "He was the best on the place."
He concluded the saison in exciting way, and his husband's safeguarded the pokal.
Thanks "Poldi" found the desolate saison for the record manager a legal conclusion.
After the front-K.o in the Champions League, the "Luven" shocked early in Europe League.
In the Super Lig, it just reached six ranks.
The saison wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"This is what we have done and that's the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Visittas, the game year was better.
In particular, thanks to Mario Gomez, which put the base on the 14th title with 26 saison tractors as Super-Lig Guard King.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope to return 31 years old.
In this case, the AC Florence was not recognized and noticed by the visits only after the puzzle test, because of the political situation in the country after its EM.
"When Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say," the architecture "Kicker" Clubchef Fikret Orman.
But it was necessary to be ready to face a third of his estimated annual officers at 7,5 million euros, Orman explained: "We can't pay his holding in Florence."

Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian suffering - More deaths
The Australian News in Thailand stands with the woman in contact, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday early.
You have rejected snippets and were treated in the hospital, but I have already been able to leave it again.
Her home journey planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the Uruber Island Phuket and in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are involved first.
The Foreign Ministry is in the continuous contact with the local authorities, so fast.
At about 200 kilometers south of the capital city Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded in the Donner Stage in a district quarter two bombs.
The police have been killed a Thailand, and about 20 people were destroyed, including Austrians, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
At the Friday, two exemptions went up again, according to the authorities were killed another man.
Phuket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion.
In the detonation near the carrying Badestrands Patong, a taxi vehicle was lost after police data.
In Surat Thani, there was a explosion of another bomb that killed a cities.
The exhibition of the authorities went into the air, according to a flower beach before the River of the East Police.
Finally, there were also requested detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the southwest and in Chumphon in the southwest.
You're out of a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bombs take the same handbook," said armed Danai Critmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We're going out that it's about a coordinated attack."
It's too early to exit possible motives, however, it's likely to handle the acts of Muslim Rebels.
Thailand media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombenatetate muslimian separatists in the south of the country.
The Thailand police explained that the attentates were not in relation to the Islamist Resistance Movement or the international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provincies," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Moreover, the bombs of the hosts of the rural military junct were laid down.
The authorities had received secret indications on existing proposals in the south of the country in the past days - however, they were not informed about the exact time and locations.
It's still unknown, which group steps behind the grounds.
The police and their officers in the entire country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, ships, tourist tractions, restaurants and welfare quarters.
In Thailand there are still smaller bombs, but most of them are not against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a Palast that was used for years by the king of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends that the Taiwan Security Authorities should be independently followed.
High Security risk (Security level 3) applies to the Narathiwat Provinces, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and Environment.
According to the absence between security forces and musulman population parts, there will be no needful travels in these provinces.
The highest safety risk (Security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The proposals on Sunday and Friday followed a few days after a restricted referendum on one of the military juncts.
This includes the military great influence in the next year.
Junta-Chef and President Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were a trial to strike the Chaos while the country moved in the direction of stability, a improvement of the economic and tourism.
The military runta, which 2014 had received the power after a fase of bloody disruption, will be able to bring the Kingdom back to stability and order.
Nevertheless, it is not achieved to the military soldier to achieve the grief of Muslim Rebels since years in the southern south of the country.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have been killed.
A year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an advice to a loved Hindu-screen - most of them were outside tourists.
It was the worst attack of the youngest history of the country.
The right "Idding Movement" is in the viewer of the Agreement for Conservation.
After several countries, the guards in the Bund have also been observed by the group.
"We see at the 'Internative Movement' tracking points for combating the free democratic basis scheme," said Hans-Georg Protection Chef of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, advantages of Islamic faith or from the nearest east are differed in extremist ways.
So we also watch the movement now.
The "iditical movement" is a grouping with French roots, which is also active since 2012 in Germany.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass reversation" and the "perdent of its own identity by overflowing."
Protectors in nine contracts - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Saturdays, Sachsen and Thuringen - have already observed the "Identifications" already.
Measures said that his authority was declined with the country's households in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Idding Movement' tries to get their target group where she is," said the officer.
Generally, extremists try to talk to them with younger languages, often with poor music.
The Islamists do the same as the legal extremists.
That's not a valid publication for the own thing.
The propaganda has to respond to the people emotionally.
Young people are specially random.
It's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports on contacts of the "Identification" to AfD policies.
He said that he had no knowledge.
There are possible contacts of this type only from a certain point relevant.
It is concerned if the relevant party - in this case the AfD - by some persons who are extremistic, change their target direction and become so extremistic.
It is therefore exciting that such persons have an influence on the party.
This is not recognized.
With a view to the clear approach of judicial infrastructures and attacks on asylum competitors and flying undertakings, he would not even speak of a new right terrorism in this context.
But in the past years, we have found that it can give right terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the free group.
It may be that further right terroristic groups or smallest groups are designed to plan advice against asylum searches, flying houses or attacks from other legal extremistic motives.
However, a German length or European control of the rightsterorism is not recognized.
The previous groups are on regional level or social networks.
It was concerned that many attacks came to the account of people who were not in the right scene in appearance.
That's the worst.
Many of the fact that at attacks on asylum income were not known as criminals, political motivated criminals or annexers of the right scene.
"Therefore many people have caused crimes that have had nothing before with legal extremists, which may have been politically indifferent, or have chosen CDU, SPD or links, which, however, radicalized by the legal extremists of votes."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte is on the Internet
The olympionics or the world records do not always determine the shoes at the olympical games.
This shows the mutual approach of Robel Kiros Hate at the sommer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatic Centre, the easy override smoke of Ethiopia so late that he was not at the time to see in the TV images.
He just missed - not as long as the section was chosen.
In social networks, there was a virtual Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old age ends with a 48-second rest of his proceedings and set up the 59 place of 59 starters.
However, it was not just his sport figgy, which went on the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old then share the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopia has received a special launch right from the international swimming band.
This is distributed to make swallows known in subpresented countries.
Because the most sporters were running in Ethopia, they just wanted to do something else.
Preparing is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the great road.
Quickly the first spitnames made the rounds.
Some media called him as "Robel of the Wal".
The English Boulevardblatt "The Sun" made a "Dad Bod" pleasure about him.
His time, he just smoked with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of free style, did not play a role.
Compared with "Eric the Eel".
In the olympical games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussamani was careful for medical attention.
Unbelievablely, the achievement of the smoker from the Equatorial Guinea, when he had to go in a proceeding over 100 meters of free style alone.
In French, Moussambani was once held.
The 22-year-old student was only eight months before Olympia and had never solved a long distance before the concurrency war.

Trump doesn't see the low choice
The Republican presidential Candydat Donald Trump says about a choice campaign in Florida.
If there is nothing to be chosen to the US President, Donald Trump has already been alternative.
He's going to the ground.
Donald Trump lost the US President's elections in November, he would not like to say, "Only, it will be a very, very, very, very beautiful, long advantage," said the candidate of the Republican in a telephone interview with the US friends' CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end of the reasons of political correction, if it is okay, Trump said.

Inside his party, he formed a lot of resistance.
Post is attached to the trade with electro-transports
An electro-instauring vehicle of German post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is clearly large.
The post also plans to sell her electric vehicle StreetScooter.
In the course, the concert wants to start the trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electro-transports from the next year also on the free market.
"We want to get in the sale of the third," said a mail talker on free.
The company tests whether it should be distributed by the letters and packages of the streetscooter by its own developed StreetScooter, also for other operations.

In the posted manufacture, the company plans the construction from to 10,000 cars per year and hard.
Gerdes had announced that the concert wanted to increase the flows of electroautos clearly and spread a full transformation on the environmental friendly vehicles.

The StreetScooter has been active since 2014 on German streets.
GfK leads to destructed business numbers
The consumer research company GfK cut out his boss Matthew Hartmann.
The back tricks came soon - but not very surprised.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK declared that the throne of the officer Matthew Hartmann would be more increasing than the success of his promised success.

details would not be called a company speaker on freeday.
Whoever leads to the market research company in the future, is still unclear.
In the training crowds, it was on the free day that the actions had recently been deployed on the further remaining success of the restructuring introduced before years.
Mr Hartmann is on the GfK-spitze since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet to see five years later," said it.
In view of the last bad GfK employment numbers, each participant will be inevitable.

Unfall - Bus smoking in cromms in grapes: Eight Last
In a accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as traveling guests, eight people were lost on Sunday in Krummholdn (Landcreis Aurich).
Two of the insistents have suffered severe sufferings, the police shared with.
The 66-year passenger of the busy of a road company of the Eisenach had to leave their data according to a consented Laster, who was part of the carrier.
The bus came to the right way from the street and rolled into a grave, as a speaker of the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Before the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus myself," she said.
The firewall frees the insects.
Six saving cars and a note car came to a accident location on the street 2.
The unexpected travellers were brought back from a line bus to the town part of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the traveling company.
The officers requested the laster traveller and possible witnesses to report to the police.
Further than 2,10 EUR for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 EUR (exter 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (exter 2,18 euros).
In addition to Azendorf, the driving driving will be increased at least if appropriate improvements are necessary.
After a override calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be at 4,37 euros per cubic meters.
As Mr Bernd Steinhauser (CSU) reported, the budget approval was established by the Agricultural Culmbach that the subsequent subsequents were reached.
The market Casendorf has been committed to the legal basis to comply with the additives.
Since 1 October 2016, the citizens and the carbon and industry equipment are needed to be carried out in the money builts.
The tax increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As the Management Leader of Herbert Schmidt showed to the Greemium, a new calculation of the offers for the availability of the market community was necessary.
In the period of October 2016 to September 2020, subtractions are also compared from the previous calculation period.
The gravity increased smidt has been based in order to carry out all three water packs related to small equipment with a very rare waterfall, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, because of the serious distribution basis, for example, the use of required repairs of several thousands of euros would have been gravited.
It is also easy to relive the reaching of water in all three facilities.
Furthermore, in the recurrency calculation period, all three items are not last in the age of their age saving and reparation applications in a significant range.
The investment in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the walshale, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt explains that Azendorf had to be exhausted the mechanical exhibition for a shame.
In the Pumpwork Welschkahl, the older 20 years of grounds had to be reached, and Lopp had to be built up at nearly 20 years after the first cross-border operator, the clinic claim, and a additional opportunity to be built in order to maintain any lawful proceedings.
Schmidt: "For these extraordinary applications, the costs of maintenance and maintenance have been considered in accordance with the new calculation period."
The equation is applied to the electric costs which are clearly under the current level of 2011/2012 at the previous calculation.
Steinhouses claimed that in the low-water accident in the three amendments, the applications for the operation and sustainment were "plexed".
In this case, the market community of large discussion costs have been disappeared in the past 20 years.
The situation for the items listed will be continued to be preavoured in view of stone households, as well as the refrigeration area of the refrigeratory frequency bathroom for these items is not able to increase because it is involved in deficiency equipment.

Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some monitors say that it's insensible against races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way and way that is already limited to absurde.
You can convert to ananas, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy lightstein wood.
The filters are unbelievable, property-transformed tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes are reached to the public.
Snapchat filters have passed in the past Critical, where they were accused that App Blackface would promote or white hair as a beautiful side.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them sliders, false dents, and amazing wings, some crisis called a rassistic caricature of Asian - "Gelb face".
They asked whether these repeated controvers had a greater problem that the company had a differency.
The news and advice were broadcast on midnight, with the reports of The Perge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat, reported that it had been deactivated.
The company offers an excuse: The filter was a hommage in anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But the foreigners who have lived rassism reminded the filter of the painful cles.
Others decreased the anime comparation.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American artstudent, whose two of them were broken on the photos that the filter was "infected and fulfilled."
She added that "she is difficult to argument a very contrary Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face was gone into a negative extern.
Snapchat is not the only enterprise that overspreads this cultural stone.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless differences and integration fight from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat's great public of young people - those in race different than their older players - could be more expected to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is amazing for a user, "that is very difficult that these things remain unmarried than it was before the case," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Sunday.
On Sunday, Zhu decided that he worked as a product manager and engineer for the media to eliminate its Snapchat account, others requested to do the same.
In a set of media and in a phone interview, she said that she believes that rassy controverses have a missing difference in the arrangement practices in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the white, only a man's leadership, and ended their assignment with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Of they have no distinct representation of people with other hair colors in their area, so they can take such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other hair colors that work there, but they are not in positions where they are safe or welcome to say something."
Others share their opinion, an excuse that Snapchat has left the largest part of the Snapchat.
The company publishes no numbers for the difference of his companies and shows its status as private enterprises.
On the Sunday, Snapchat denied to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his cooperators, but according to a speaker, the company has recently established a personal responsibility that focuses on subpresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, "I ask if they need more users as we can say that it is not O.K.."
Military execution Flake ISIS Secret Service Information, establishes the Committee of the Congress
The United States of the Central Command has changed reporting information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the soccer, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the real conditions to be placed, a Research Committee reported in a report on the Sunday.
The proceeded report, established by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of Streaming Force, the Secret Service Committee and the Conference Committee, reported by great independence under the Central Command of Secret Service Analysts, which reported how their estimates were amended to the American efforts in combating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military main quality in Tampa, Florida, which stipulates the American military ropes in the nearest east and Central.
"Message services information, which were typically rejected by higher Centcom Communities, were regularly indicated a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions to be in place and were more positive than the other analyse of news services," a report quoted to the report.
"What happened in the Centcom, is inacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, the Republican member of the representative's house.
The guidance errors in Centcom are rich to the top of the organization.
The 10-second report shows detailed competent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi battle forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government positions have been given under Obama's indications to change the reports, the analysis shows how the analyses have seen the pressure of their proposals, a optimistic image of the distress of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"In the first half year 2015, many Central Command Pression Parts, opinions and opinions were clearly positive than the fact that it is agreed."
For example, a centcom participant was published that a military reversation of Mossul could already be started in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of remediation, it is so clear." Mike Pompeo, the Republican Congress Assembly of Kansas, said in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the Central Command changed the reporting reports to explore the risk by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicaners called the Task Force in life after they were played that analyses were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday is still completed by detailed recognitions during the expenditures.
Moreover, the Centcom reports are reported by the Secretary-General of the Defence Ministry.
Democratic members of the Communication Committee published their own recognition on Sunday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom established an excessive limited process for the creation of reporting services for ISIL and the Iraqic Security Services," the higher democratic democratic in the Commission, member of the representative House Adam B. ship, was known in a opinion.
This process, so Mr. shipff, "forgot the publication of reports of notification reports," denied the Moral under analyses and "with increasingly few spaces for different opinions."
But Mr. shipff and the Democratics said that there were no indications to the white house in the Centcom analysists in respect of a "determined political opinion".
The provisional results of the reports of the Congress have been published on Sunday by The Daily Beast.
In the past August, the New York Times reported the reports by the General Inspector of Pentagon, which were taken after the conflict of Centcom Analysts.
Patrick Evans, a Pentagon Pressor of the Pentagon, stated that the Ministry of Defence would not comment the reports of the Congress, while the reports of the General Inspector were still in consent.
But he also added that "experts sometimes have a differences of opinions in respect of the interpretation complex data and that the communication services and the Defence Ministry will welcome a competitive discussion of these important subjects of the national defence."
The reviews have affected the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a review made between a growing number of members of the Defence Ministry).
However, the accusations of the past year have issued how President Obama can leave the Central Command for honorable estimations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The crisis on the secret information about the Islamic State reminds the facts of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analysis, Gregory Hooker, considered a letter about how the so-called Government under George W. Bush recommends only a small investment struggle in Iraq and a little time to make the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in reaching the current report on the Islamic State.
In the past year, the team to Mr Hooker stated that the Government's opinions of aircraft against the Islamic State had no significant effects on the financing of the terrorist group, since these provisorian refineries had been carried into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms the Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislation because of its extent positive estimation of the war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went on April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won fourth match in the fieldhockey of women, a showdown with the British
One day after she was shut up three gates during a 6-1 passenger over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American fieldhockey team of women in a match on Sunday to India that Americans won 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually show a reasonable loss, but Bam (27) said that they could not remember that they had ever done.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't belong to people who keep their doors in memory.
However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympical concurrence fight and are also in their group with the Britishs on the first place that remains unbelievable after their 2-0 shoes against Japan.
The United States and the United States will be in the last game of the first rounds.
Both manners have already qualified for the fourth final, the game will be determined which the two of the inside their groups of six teams will be obtained to the first and the second place.
The first placed will go to the strong Hollands a little longer from the way that leads the other group.
As even the game on the Sunday, the Americans have solved a surprising branch through their success history, four years after they landed at the past London games at the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grows up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time with three years had a hockkey slider (their two older sisters played the sport at the Trixel University), with 16 years she became the National Spider of the United States, the last in the history of the team.
She passed the olympian in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012 came, in which she and her team spread everything for her and her team.
In the next year, Craig Parnham, an English, trainer of the National Team, began to be better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a body change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work pension in London that we had now.
We've been able to pull the road completely.
The bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a back-up from the neighborhood area.
Otherwise, the team showed a surprise smoking and held the game of 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game in their hands.
She fulfilled a sprint with the flake ball over the left floor, then went into the middle and rolled the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2-0 leader.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tourner for the American Porter, Jackie Briggs, who had to build a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good it will be depending on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the olympical games, the ten of the trampolin
Whereever you are, as soon as soon as it is, it's the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel active and unbelievable, a rare stage between competition and strips.
It's like the olympical failure itself a burning stab which is gained by the armbrust protection to the smooth to the turner to the triatlet.
You can't enable the TV browser, read a journal or listen to your neighborhood's conversation in the Coffeshop, without listen to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the war between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's still Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who, first at the olympical games and is a female smoke with grass, could have been under these known names sending to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-emotion TV, if he was a smoker, tourner or even a smoke.
But Dooley, 28, from the Forest Lake, California, fights in the olympical trampolin tours around gold.
The olympical flamme does not light any events like.
In addition to the center, partly in the shadows, the sports that are not commonly recognized: air pistol shoes, bogen shoes, badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the smoke and we can rule it long.
But if I have to make a significant argument for my specific love, let me take attention to the discreet charme of the trampolin.
Although the trampolins are already an olympical event since it had its debt in Sydney since 2000, the last 16 years were so surprised that many of those whom I asked, they didn't know that it was mostly an olympian port.
This may also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States athletes sent to concurrence war, it has never wined a medaille in trampolins and has been a athlet that has made it to the end.
The Chinese and Russians encourage the price for men, Chinese and Canada to share them for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medale from London.
The trampolin shoes has a certain outside shooter, partly because it is for the unexpected ear pasder for a clown school than the sound for the olympical games.
In this position, I should agree that I am not expert, but I'm just a land-related dishusy.
It has humorist potential - the cartoonous pits of his desire to end - but also the thanks for the tourn and the tauchins, which two sports that are associated with it in the most essential.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "Springbrett".
The surrounding guests slip on a giant trampoline, shoot at least 30 feet in the air, and must be a number of falling movements (driven, heat, and saltos) before they are on the feet.
They will be evaluated by the official olympian program after execution, difficulty level and 'flow time'.
Two-real athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be attracted in Rio.
The most common olympical vector is right out.
Medial hopes must continue to gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and bottom on the game.
They do not only the target line or the output, but also in the television transmission a further honey objective: the world or the Olympiary Record.
The targeted stream is nobel, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to dream a supervisor to drunken.
But it's also what I'm looking at these games as something amazing.
That's why the trampolin offers a time.
The vector of the training policy is up.
A forward move is not the goal.
He or she smokes, looks like a astronaut, go up, then go down, then the mosquito again up.
There is also a concurrence, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no active attack on the objective, no wild in the remote, only the dreamer, elegante raising time and gravity.
It's like the competition in the Olympic games can only be.
The quality and ends of women will be located on the Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 East Time, which are the men on the Sunday, even at 13.00.
NBC will be eliminated as part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Many, they promise a quiet, clean moment, which will probably be overviewed in the general Tumult.
If the achievement of intelligence only can be achieved by the approach and objectivization of men's athletes - as the US tourner says the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects to be a new rent, a new campaign.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, long a United States connector
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators, requesting political changes in Ethiopia, stipulate the violent resistance of the government.
The witnesses say that some protestants were killed during the meetings with the police in shopping changes.
Is Ethiopia just to break together?
In the last ten years, it was one of the stabilest African countries, a solid linker of the West with a fast growing economy.
But in the past months, protests against the Government were struggled by the country and were exhausted in more areas.
Last week, thousands of people in the streets smoothed and required fundamental political changes.
The response of the Government was incompatible with human rights organizations.
The witnesses said that the police shoot and killed a hundred unwashing demonstrants.
Find videos in the circuit of the protests, likely from the last or beginning of this year, show how security leaders smoked young people with shoes, while they were offered to make a handmaid against a wall.
The chief of the United Nations Authority for Human Rights requires now an income investigation.
"It was always difficult to maintain this country and to come to the future even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of Africa in the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most popular country of Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work together with the Ethiopias to fight terrorism in the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, in particular, have so many western help.
Ethiopian economy expansioned in considerable time.
His infrastructure has been drastically improved - there is a new pendler travel in the main city Addis Abeba.
The streets are regularly quiet, safe and safe.
Even if the Ethiopias were all other than a shape for democracy - human rights organizations continued to submit the impression by the Government - the opposition in the country was limited to which dissidents were efficiently carried out.
Many were sent to exil or prison, killed, or drived into the streets of the wilderness.
But it could be changed.
"When you print people and have no other options except to protest, it's going to be," said Seyoum Teshome, a dozen in the centraletia.
The whole young man protests.
A generation protested.
There are many arguments that cover everything from the use of the ground to the struggle in relation to the power of the rural coalition.
After a longly criticized election last year, the Governing Party and their partners received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 per cent of the Parliament.
Eventually, the spannings exceed from the border to Eritrea; a fight for this skin, distracted line requested in June hundreds of lives.
Analytics fear that separators such as the Oromo-free front or the national freedom front of the Ogaden, which have been rejected in the past or less recent years, can use Turbulens and rearmament.
A number of factors explain why the feelings of debt after years of the exploitation under the surface are now exploded.
The first seems hard: Smartphones.
First in the past years, many ethiopics were in the situation to communicate through social media, since more smarter smartphones were always frequenter and improved the Internet services.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular distances, especially in protests, many can still communicate about the Internet proxys that hide where they stop.
Many young Ethiopia had given them to gather themselves as protesters.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromes and Amharas, the two largest Ethanians in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Euns, Amharas, who comes from Ethopia overwhelmed Christian highlands, were in political and economic, while they built the oromes from which many Muslims are and live in flashland areas.
But this also changes.
"We are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The greatest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos felt that Ethiopias are inappropriately dominated by members of the Ethnic group of Tigray, which exceed about 6 percent of the population and are dominated in military, secret services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the rebellion is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ancient rebellion leader, was until his death in an unexpected disease in 2012 for 17 years.
He was considered as a tactic genius, a man who could think about the edge.
Analysts say that he was especially increasing to achieve preceding signs of unfortunateness and to use special payments to edit adults and to make them unbelievable.
"The current regime is missing in this basic story," said Abdi, a conflict-tanalytic.
The new Ministry of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dealer, has been chosen for relatively increasing reasons to introduce the position of Mr. Meles.
Otherwise, as Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, comes from the south.
Analytics say that he does not increase the confidence of the security services controled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloody.
The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a call was 2005 after thousands of people protested against choices, which seemed to be broken by the government and then locked.
During the following ratios, many protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last months, and this time of the rebellion was relatively quickly completed.
Development experts honored Ethiopian leaders for their visual infrastructure planning, such as the new pendlership, and for their messible progress in the fight of poverty.
But of course, this is not the intention of the internal misgunst of the Ethiopic Government.
And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesting in Gondar, an amharian city, led from Tigray, and the hazard against Tigray is always more common in the social media.
Analytics say that the protests bring the United States and other western links to a proper position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flows on the incoming Somalia, even if she recently reported that she closed this base.
While the West wants to support the democracy, he does not want to join his linkers in a already volatile region.
"This," Mr Abdi said, "it's a very dark gratitude."
Donald Trump explains that Obama has founded ISIS if "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on the Friday to destroy the last controvers that turned into his campaign, in order to indicate that his multiple recovery, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not be the "beloved" of the Islamic Territory Group.
This clarification has made new questions on the capacity of communication of the President candidate of the Republican, whether he is clear and understandable to communicate with the American public.
It also brings his assistants who try to take him in protection during an eventually phase, in the actual position to explain statements that he couldn't even have agreed.
After he had made the adjudication in an election challenges at the middle chamber, Mr. Trump in relation to the respect on the Sunday and said in Interviews that he would not really indicate that the President and Mrs Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.
The second was the adjustment to the past day on which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said that the accusation was completely serious.
When the Conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to delay the exhibition by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican president candidate would not know anything about it.
The last storm of the crisis was made down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus on his campaign because of falling review values to the economic level.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have been maintained to talk about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Having reported about Twitter, he warned Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead up to higher staff and that he had found their conversation longly.
Mr. Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his protection.
At the end of July he made a strong crisis when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons e-mails, but later he explained, "Obviously, I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the speaking limits in the policy and then turn back after necessary.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages will be taken from his fans how they arrive, and then "clare" each after the reaction. " Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observed the language of both candidates.
But I believe he's too clear enough to keep his statements hard enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways and ways.
Instead of deploying the sound for the President's elections, Mr. Trump accepted another additional sound since his review values have continued to return.
A new question of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on freetage, showed a leadership with a great prevention in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-an-heading rounds in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to not forgive himself for his provoking excuses, he often accuses his critics to destroy his statements, or his humor is wrong.
But while he strengthened the attention in the last months of his Presidency campaign, Mr. Trumps Shere brought his loyal assistants to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, independently of how it can also be provoking his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, ancient citizen manager of New York and one of the Trumps prominant advisers, had a great courage to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from the Sunday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said so he asked the rightness of Mr. Trumps Committees if Mr. Obama and Mr. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this meaning that before Obama ISIS was a nearly unknown, small organization, he called it frontballs, completely wrong, and it happened because he left the forces from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans tried to argument that the Government under Obama, Mrs. Clinton, served as a foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand it by allowing it to bring the situation in the nearest East aggressive.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania, on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks to the media and proposed them to go up to each of his words and to be taken against him.
He decreed the "arms, wedding" teleshexpers who try to understand him and said, "They can't!".
Some of the democratics spoke about Mr. Trumps' forgiveness as only another evidence that he was inadequate to the President's office.
One on the price from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Coffee was a fat coffee in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar that didn't have a Wi-Fi, but for 15 years you served a good coffee.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were broken.
The business Soap Cherie, who replaced the Verb in 2014, sold Seife in form of Cupcakes.
Aheimic trusted it as the last loss in a geographical city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and connected now is a seat business."
But if New York is a change, it is also a new finding.
A rebuilding Cafe opened the last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of his original location.
The new version has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same workers and a similar atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year co-operator of the old coffee, the owner and businessman of the new Café.
He began to work 2001 in Verb and stayed there until the end.
When a client invited him to provide money for a new foreign site, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, holding many.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bathrooms like the same expresso machine model.
It is also used the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He brought new tattoos.
On the food cards are sandwiches with Speck and cups and there are guarantees like capers and sauses.
There are natural shoes.
The coffee serves no more beer, for which there are fresh shoes.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream on ancient stage.
"A lot of old customers were also broken by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Rebecca Oliveira was a such customer on the Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived before in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she went to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb closed, she opened the coffee for a while, she said.
"I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb, which I liked," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, even if she's on this day instead of her normal Iced Coffees, a Blended Chai Tea, which is a new addiction.
Tom Rosenthal is a longer and faithful client since the beginning of the verse in 2003.
He went there before the work and made the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swedish board and they prepared my allthing ball with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new contributions in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his normal order, but sometimes he changed his allthing balls with Speck, Eagle and Case.
Rodriguez said that he didn't get a role about that the seed business has taken the old business room.
In fact, the properties of the Soap Cherie ordered to produce a special seed for Verb with the coffee coffee of the coffee as a suit.
"I think we'll still go to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, political inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the cafe.
A new client has translated the food card to Poland and Rodriguez said that he suggests to make them soon to feel welcome his neighbors.
The location also has further priorities.
A local saftlocal wants to fill and sell the coffee coffee in the flash.
There's a chance that the coffee spreads into an incoming building.
For many customers, there is a new verb to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a stammkund and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee was closed.
When the new coffee opened, Whitt said that the behavior of the local and the offering felt a new coffee like a housequarter.
"I had to hurry," he said.
The depressive food of the economic crisis in "a rich age"
In March 1933, shortly after his upstairs to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his party at the Oval Office.
As Feinschmecker, the President Roosevelt had a favour to raffined delikates of the Fifth Avenue as Pâte de fuel grass and Maryland water smoke supply.
His menu on this day was something more poor: full of eggs in Tomatsanuce, cartoffel pudding and as the Desert was a plot pudding.
"It was an act of cultural solidarity with leading people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Your husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The marriage lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food history.
Coes the last book "Chop Suey" was made by the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while Ziegelman reported in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a house in a lower east side of the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A comprehensive age", which appears on the Sunday in Harper Verlag, explains the history of the American kitchen during the great depression.
They showed the kulinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop at the evening, a small, shockless Imbiss in Flatiron District, which is already since the Bursencrash 1929.
Seegelman, 54, made a fresh sheet with olive pigs, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with cartoffel pipes and meat.
When the reporter reported the Hackbrats, it found the couple for a discussion about the food in the surface of the Great Depression.
"The rich food was very loved," said Zeegelman.
There were landsbrots, levercase and bohnbrots.
They were prepared from an addiction and something billy that stretched the tattoo.
Be careful to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as evening.
Coe's green.
"It must have put himself in the magnitude as a skin," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.
Many of women buyed for men's field workers and it served fresh packed pasts for the morning, lunch and evening.
There were the Americans who sent food to hunger Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" shows the ways that the country has turned out to be no more the sharp country.
"It was a time in the eating for the Americans was a central, speeding theme," advised Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
In addition, the new budget device was: secretly food such as bread and caserols were made to basic foods that the caserole as "revaluate a wonderful type of food resources", noted the Ziegelman, since the kitchen could be hidden under a cruel sauce.
Frisches Ost was replaced by a lot of pounds.
The meat, which was the middle point of the American kitchen, was made to a strange service luxury.
Proprietary mixes were tested because a calorian and perpetual satisfaction had a prevention before the challenge or even healthy kitchen understanding.
While their research for the book, which also contains receipts, a Court prepared from this epoch, cutting rubbers with the earthly butter, to.
"It wasn't a favorite adjustment in the Mediterranean," said Coe.
Zeegelmann continues to say, "I was surreal."
The grounds butters and the rubbers do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the budget recipes.
As never before or since, the budgetary economic - including Louise Stanley, leader of the Federal Office of Home Economic between 1923 and 1943 - the country's famous residence.
While they published receipts and articles in journals and magazines, they encouraged women to be "the household policies" and the exemption to transform packages such as cremige spaghetti with cartoons in cost-times.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical leckers.
In particular, the reports on the response of the Government to the hunger citizens, such as President Hoovers Hoovers, Lass-mich-mich-cookes.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa Builder House Cookie of his kitchen, he eating like the millions of people of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental kitchen like fish with gurkensauce," said Coe.
He did eat in a fast guaranteed food room and brought a smoking.
He was a great reality frame.
The President Roosevelt may have been the same error if his wife Eleanor would not request him to make an example with his magician.
As it described in the book, the marriage of a household with no interest in challenges by Mrs. Roosevelt to bring the white house the longest food in Washington, but also one of the unfortunately prepared."
Many of the species of the era of the Great Depression to eat were disappointed as soon as the land returned to the feet.
The conscience is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Zeegelman, and how science was applied to food.
The couple gave the write of the book to have better understanding of the episodes of Ziegelman's smoker mother - for example, as they couldn't remove food.
"They had a real fear of the consumption of food," said Coe.
The Rigelman remembered, "He made people really sick."
There was the wind-building event.
After the tax collectors were cut off at Eisenberg, they and Coe went out a desert that they had prepared home: the plane officer, the President Roosevelt eat at the midnight.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Zeegelman, and added that it was a normal trick to maintain severe recipes to send a name.
There was no shoot shoes, only flowers, something meal, sugar, water and room.
Everyone put something contraryly in the woods, broun glibbers.
Excitingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe got a meeting three times.
Like a Can-Do Budgettier, he said to his wife, "A few happy walnuts would help."
By bombing attack, he was the held of Aleppo
He set his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the held of Aleppo: Khaled Omar raised his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others the life.
Now the 30-year-old is dead at a fass bomb attack of the Asad Regimes.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group who saved the lives by the image-security for about 60,000 people.
2900 freely put your own life on the game to get people out of the bottom houses and to help the first help in the war area.
You are the helds of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protector, which shows him at a 11-hour saving a smoking from the dreams of a house, went around 2014.
It made the Syrian to lighting icons in the degrees of the war.
But when he had never seen himself, he said, "To me this is the real Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Before Omar himself hit a victim attack, he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters have taken four fass bombs over the Alzadia Bezirk, one was filled with chlorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people are painful for attempts.
"We now shoot the weird override of the bomb to not play children like that," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The killed bombs of the Asad-Regimes had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest wirbeltier is almost 400 years old
Seltener view.
Greenlandhaie is mostly in winter to the surface.
This Hai was able to return to the sea after an investigation on the boat of Sanna's research ship.
He was born 1624 and smoothed with 1 km/h through North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland has only been achieved with 150 years of advance.
In accordance with Greenlandhai, on the basis of the North Atlantic, he is in the middle of 1.220 meters.
Only when it comes around, the five meters of long animals are stealing at 2,6 km/h - and is with this maximum speed half as fast as a Robbe.
However, this lifestyle of long-term seems to be a patent-security for a high age.
Julius Nillen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the book "Science" however by a Greenlandhai, which may be 392 years old.
"Warnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifespanne, which means a world record for wireless animals.
The evolution biologist has already been convinced that Greenland would be stoned.
Only the evidence were missing.
Greenland is hard to watch, finally they live in particular in the eishers before the dark towns of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Since they prevent water temperatures to prevent the six degrees Celsius, most of them are on the surface only in the winter.
On the lifestyle of the Greenland Haiti, researchers know a little bit.
Their time of time they make it when they spent six animals before Spitzbergs with a sender.
Eventually, these hairs: In the middle of a beast, researchers found the rest of a Robbe, one other had covered the eggs of a young icebar.
Perhaps they lie sleeping animals or patterns on the basis of the island and look for Kadaver, who are cutting down from higher water skins.
Julius Nillen and his colleagues are now investigated by 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergs as a beginning from the depth of North Atlantic.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to detect the age of the animals, they analysed the licensers of the hair.
This center of the eye is already from the born of the hair, which contains proteins will not be renewed later.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of cool-14 in the linsengers.
Their birth should therefore be after the past 1960s, as the larger number of the radioactive cool substances in the atmosphere.
In the length of 220 centimeters of the length of the third-length animals, the licensers had a low survey of cool-14 from the atomwater trials, so it had to be held in his investigation in 2012 in his 50th birthday.
All the larger Greenlandhaie had in their linsensors a normal cool-14-mengen, which includes cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the cool substance 14 hours for a 493 centimeter long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hai with 502 centimeters even 392 years old.
That Greenlandhai wedding was known first when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assume a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters, even at the role of the age of a generation, and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland has obviously been raised by at least half a century.
It also needs to be a virtual animal in the present world record.
It is not a case that this methusale lives first in the waters of the waters.
The previous recorder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, in which the spectacle at the neck stood a 120-year-old harpooneer pitze, was captured before Alaska.
Through the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often run.
So they're going later - and older.
In order to keep warm in the calm water, the animals are often large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surfaces, through which the beast is incorruptible.
Thus, the loss of temperature of a graph of mouse is much greater than in a graph of elephant.
Another benefit: you have less enemies.
"A small animal lives dangerously and should concentrate on it, at least possible to have many seeds," explains the evolution biological scarlet.
A very big animal should invest its resources more in a long life.
Background in Double Package
With the subjects around the buildings, the community's ratio has seen severely in the last meeting.
The Gremium made the communication of Mr. Robert Putz, that "only the marketing of the latest designed apartments can be started."
After clarifying the basic, part-allocation, and concluding issues, and the requests were able to meet, the sale of the baskets in the fields "Straßway" and "Show-West" (Accommodation of Binder Street Section 1) is nothing more in the way of interest.
The assembly Council is convinced that the boards in the rural and quiet habitat community are the same way as young families and sick elders.
As it was said, the constructives can immediately report in the Rathaus, about the delivery of the Parcels will be considered immediately in his September meeting.
In order to ensure the requests for the design of workplaces, the Community Council decided to amend the plan of planning in part-term areas in the first year of this year.
So, in the field of undertaking, the water area already indicated for two parts of the country street 2112 is expanded.
Frankfurt benefited by Brexit
The city in Main, after the concurrence with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, had the best opportunity to make works and firms from London.
"It is very probable that Frankfurt benefits most of Brexit-Votum," says Michael Vogtlland, leader of the competent field financial markets and immobilial markets of the EW.
After the Brexit Referendum, it is uncertain that money houses may continue to be affected from London from financial businesses throughout the EU.
For the EU's so-called pass, their authorisation is available in the United Kingdom.
This just uses a large US bank.
More banks have already announced to lose jobs.
The Lobby Unit "Frankfurt Main Finance" is calculated with 10000 new workplaces in Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the EW, the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for the money policy and monitoring of the largest eurozone banks, and more important authorities, as well as the European Security Survey of EIOPA and the ESRB.
In Paris, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has the main session, but it is less important for the financial market than the ECB.
"The nearby to the notebank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the monitoring," says IW Professor Vochtlands.
In Luxembourg, a large fund branch, but snow like Dublin in the infrastructure was worse.
Frankfurt is clearly easier to obtain the great airport.
Moreover points the city with easy accessible vessel mobiles.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-valuable offices," says Vogtlands.
In his case, the positions for pre-classified carbon mobiles are 50% higher than the main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition, thanks to the good medical care and infrastructure and less criminality.
In a ranking of the company management Mercer, the city was located at seven, Luxembourg at place 19, Dublin at place 33 and Paris at 37.
Even if living quality is a question of the proposals: "It is a strong position for the European Internal Market, that Frankfurt may take further banks and investors," follows the EW.
However, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, although Brexit-Votum, the economic researchers say.
For this reason, the strengths are also discussed: In London, according to the numbers of the landesbank Helaba end 2015 around 400 people in the bank market, in Frankfurt were 62500.

A lot of spears used before to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Life Day, which has been forced to protect the animals.
"Before we developed this... Toolkit, we could see a change in these congregations, where they are much more conscious that they can lose the elephants from their fields without destroying the elephants," outside the officer of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the balance of the elephant with a fax and the branch in a horn.
If he's not cut off, a similar "Chiliwolke" will be thrown.
Chilipuder mixt with the earth will be packed together with a fireworker in a condom that will be turned to the sunshine.
When it is attached, the condom is opened with a cloud and spreads fine steel at chilipuder in the air.
A hair is already exhausted in the rule to lose the elephants.
A last opportunity gives a conquest that shoots a golden rain firework in the air and causes a loud, heavy explosion.

The Jewish Register ran Berliner Hotel because the Israeli choice was removed after the "Arabic" requirement - RT News
A French register with Jewish roots discovered a media call after he had recognised that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed a Israeli choice, since the Arab guests were a co-operator.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" removed his mistake in Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing a open letter to the German FAZ magazine.
During his last residence, Lanzmann Israel tried to find in the country selection list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between countries that could be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in Berlin, the capital city of the new Germany in 2016, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinx Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through a own call center.
After an explanation, the register returned to the hotel reception.
The answer he got there, "shock him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel officer said that the measure was a "respective decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel".
The reason that stayed behind the register was still more low in the register.
"The greatest part of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the proceeding is deleted," the Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israelic Messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shande", reports the Southeast magazine.
We were excited and occupied by this event.
That's really funny.
The fact that this has been attached to Germany in exactly this hotel ketch is even a greater trouble.
This doesn't need any explanation.
We hope that the hotel is "the correct conclusions" said the officer.
The case solved a very big resonant in the Internet, where people called a whole scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that the Arab Gast's requirements had "invited".
"Shoot you," says it in another contribution in which the hotel, which is located in the noble curve damage, is near a synagoge.
The hotel was quickly all accusations of himself and called the case a "review" and "promise" to Lanzmann, reports the Spigel.
"It's never been a direct indication," Israel didn't take to the quick selection list," the southern magazine quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.

Schotte Callum Skinner shoots to home as the British Gold for Radsport
Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men team sprint in Veodrom in Rio to defense the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old of Glasgow took the anker role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. The young pound made the league fierce when he smoked home to enter a ransom from the favorites of New Zealand.
Inglaterra was recommended for four years ago, while he had the fifth of six olympianold medailles.
They repeated the trick after they had got a nice sixth place in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the agent Jamie Staff.
They did this rightly as hinds opened.
Hoys Restaurant produced a lack that Kian Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man where they stayed, when she saw the potential in the shoot that has now discovered.
Hinds, Kenny - those with Hoy shipping - and Skinners set a olympiar record in the quality rounds, but in the standard rounds the newsleelands in the first round.
And the British Trio won the duell with gold.
After his rounds, Kenny brought the team back and Skinner held it.
A strategic change made a large part of the transformation, which went to the hind in a higher range to ask him and allow Kenny and all the scenarios to keep the time.
Hoy looked out from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went up to the potest.
The 23-year-old scanner of Glasgow said, "It's a terrible comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have established an olympian record in the end and the world's master.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph 2012, Kennys and Hoys gave Hindes that he fell on the ground after a weak start.
He returned this exhibition later, and there was no influence of English rivals.
In such a surprising guidance, this time there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribs like London."
We were gathered as a team in the last three months.
We have gone to so many world titles so bad that it was incredible to win again in the olympian.
This is an event, a goldmedaille for the nation who had been won seven of 10 titles, both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we are expected to be successful for five days in Velodorom.
The form of Kennys is in the field of the possibility that he repeated the Hoys wind of three olympical gold medailles in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - the exact 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a appearance of a holy date for the British sport; on the day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a buyer of six gold medailles and a silvermedaille.
That's the same way from Hoy.
Kenny takes the next part in Sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I just like this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a single thing to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medailles, he should be struck to the ritter."
It was the only medical competition of the day, but there were more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest division in four-kilometers.
They arrived at 3:51,942.
The World Record, 2012 winning in London Gold, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) are found today on the second day of the concurrence, in place of the winging is in the focus.
He had been held in the last night with employees before the qualification when he called the functioners to measure his body size.
In the consequences of women's competition, which will continue tomorrow and end, advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngvia in the world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team is allowed to dominate the middle period of the Olympical Games and to take a shit at the Mediterranean.
After a real exciting demonstration of absolute dominanz in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were exceeded.
Dramas were played in the background, so the return of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and Mobbing projects and the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in Veodrom, it looks totally after that, as it might be reiterated by the leading GBs, who has reached his height point to the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's smeltery is questioned as a result of the energy relief
The future of the aluminium smoking of Portland in Victoria - and hundreds of workers - are on the game because the additives inform the energy providers and all the contracts of delivery, as the provider energy companies reported.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria in the beginning of this year to no further subventions for the operation of the annex.
A subvention laid down for 20 years in November.
Before 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa Attachment in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 workplaces - direct and indirect - may be dangerous in a closement.
Furthermore, it may have effects to the Lord, because the smoking seeds are used around 10 per cent of the entire electricity production of Victorias.
2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closement of the Anglesea powerwork last year.
The smells of Alcoa in Portland loss money and risks a closement.
This step follows the annual speculations in respect of the future of the additive, originally as the consequence of the strong Australian dollars and last because of the electrical price for the annex.
AGL, which provides the great aluminium smeltery with his Loy Yang A power work in Latrobe Valley, shared that it appears that three other owners will be informed of their contracts.
The annex is in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holds smaller parts.
"AGL says that the income in Portuguese will continue to operate, which means more physical demands by the chemical cycle," the company shared with.
AGL further stated that the Treaty would be "security businesses" that should be enforced since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of reporting, so they will be finished 2017.
"It is therefore the AGL that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the income," said the Strom Leader.
All potential effects on the AGL commitments from GJ 18 are currently restricted by the prognoses of the strong term markets for large trade prices.
AGL described that the value of the contracts already has already been submitted in its year-end end of $187 million in "the expectation of an announcement".
Alcoa said that the decision to explore the contracts that "the capacity of Alcoas... to achieve the smoke or to ensure the energy consumption to the smelzery."
The United States undertaking said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have been in force from November this year, even though there is another statement, why it has been returned from the Treaty.
Analytics warn the worst economic relations of the market before the possible closement of Portland's smellzery in Victoria and the Tomago approach near Newcastle.
In relation to the opinions of the analysis in the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses annually 600 Megawatts and Tomago around 900 Megawatts in the stream.
If both items are disappeared from the market, it would mean a significant reduction of the demand on the [Strom market].
And it would not be good for us as a Strom Generator," he said.
More than only one Cardashian Reality-TV-Star, Kendall is on the Cover of the September output of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Cardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the employed seventh of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the Market Newsman of Estee Lauder, and on the Fashion Weeks in Mailand, Paris and New York, reported the news on the Sunday on their Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I brought the view of this cover to win," wrote Kendall.
The integration of the Covers followed a stranger (or simple Keeping Up like the Kardashian), the scripted Reality Video, which shows the whole Cardashian Jennifer family (excluding problems Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of the most favorable showbiz-onkels and products of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot the cover of their sister and the cutting with a classic whistling: they all have planned a translation party.
This makes the clearly arrested action nearly every birthday section of a child's sentence (Seacrest brought the set, "Did you think we'd forget you?" with the reality of a chartcabine on a bedroom at 8:00 tomorrow), but Kris had to share their other girls anywhere to this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue started a new surgery of Kardashian.
Kendalls great sister Kim likes her what the Vogue-Cover has hit (see and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the copy of the September issue of the magazine is a ligue for yourself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sale of the year.
With a range that is more similar to a photoband as a moderate writer, the output is a large number of publishers (South Fashionist was from 832 pages of the cholera 615 pages Publication).
The fulfillment of his coverstars is so widely expected that in the last two years of the magazine photos were still insured before the official recognition.
Women that were already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In the past years, there were more often more "shots, models" than "Models, which are the carriers" on the cover.
Oscar Press-treacher and Dior-Mark New Yorker Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even when Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the "Durchbrush model" of her generation, is fulfilled under the previous category, it is in a good company.
These challenges are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people today, who know how you turn a good snapchat video (in even if everything is attached to Jenner).
They are really talented women that are designed in the conversation branch.
Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, was published by Lemonade one of the most successful years of their carriers.
Of course, Gener's success doesn't like anybody.
With its reality-TV history, Jenner's position was always a special point in the modem environment.
In June, the only Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hayd was criticized and called it "the mixture of the moment."
These feelings reached up when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.
But on the misfortune, it seems to be fulfilled on the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the Cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the most real meaning of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes publication for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sold pictures from themselves on their like Paywall Apps.
She sells her pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the LOVE magazine.
And in their free time, she is to see in the reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kurtney and their children.
Communities centres show a year of 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the needs of the country will be rejected by the Community law centres each year, while the broadcast causes the effects of further measures on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five people - most of the older persons, immigrants, helpers, victims of military and those who have no means for unrighteous delocations and similarity - are denied in their request for uncounted law and law.
The legal services of the community who have already been carried out are prepared for further curses.
Since June the next year, these law centres have been proposed to lose more than 30 per cent of their contracts.
The Director of the Communities Centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last highlight of the national agreement of Community laws has already been rejected by thousands of people each year.
Farrell said that the situation would be more worse without a reaching the decision of the Agreement.
"Queensland community centres are chronicly funded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are denied," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unoverviewable and impressive crimes, families who go through separations, workers who have unreasonablely solved - all these people have problems rightly and this highlight shows that they can't get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Agreement Government will reduce the average of 30 per cent, which means that thousands of needed people from Queensland will be required to justify their legal problems without any help.
We request the General Association and the Ministry of Agreement and the Senators of Queensland George Brandings to immediately exhaust these medium courses, so that people can get the help that they need in legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the country fulfilled its contribution to the measures for judicial aid on the national average.
It is now the time to view the needs of the Community rights centres and their customer communities and that the Government of Palestinian invests in this important work.

Bordinis Conquisite requires shame of the campaign for the destruction of the Sorgfalt obligation and Philip because of the body pollution and remaining sealies.
Trumps Press speaker Hope Hicks was not to get a opinion.
Try to contact Philip also missing.
WCCB, a local sender in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is not longer employer of the campaign.

The Republican Presidentkandidat Donald Trump has carried a contrary campaign.
The procedure says Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstes Gericht, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Square: Requests for country choices: Loss SPD and CDU
In the following elections, the Mecklenburg Forpommers (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) are drawn significant losses for the Government parties SPD and CDU.
This has received representative reviews of the INSA Research Institute for the "image" citation (from Friday).
While the Red Black Government Coalition in the north could be more ruled, this is not possible after the review values in Berlin.
In two contracts, the SPD would be the most strongest party and had a good chance to continue the Government team.
In the Mecklenburg Forpommers, the SPD was 35,6 per cent of five years ago to 24 per cent.
The party takes it as a matter of question only before the CDU, which could return to 23%.
The third space is turned between the left and the AfD.
The links comes to 19 per cent (for 18,4 per cent), the AfD would first be represented by 19 per cent in the country day.
The Green would like to reach 6 per cent of losses (for 8,7 per cent) back to the serious countrytag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the country day.
In Berlin's department election, the SPD is only 23 per cent of the question. (See 2011: 28,3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 per cent to 23,4 per cent.
It is still low to the green 19 per cent (2011:17,6 per cent), but before the links with 15 per cent (for 11,7 per cent).
The AfD would first represent 14 per cent in the House of Parliament.
With 5 per cent, the FDP may expect a return that the pirates would be able to preserve the income in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his manufacturer lived a deaster.
The device was about a half kilogram and was more than four times so hard as a iPhone 5.
It was dicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand.
In the same way, it was very crazy.
The embedded storage started eight Megabytes, which would be rich today for almost two selfies with high solution.
A iPhone is distributed in middle distance with at least 16 Gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came just 20 years ago on August 15, 1996, in business - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, loveholders can buy the devices still in the Internet, but they are somewhere from the stone time of the Internet time.
However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish Mobile Phone Hestler had announced the product a few months ago on the computer massa Cebit in Hannover as "Office in Westentian format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could have been amount of: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communication.
Even the access to web pages was possible by the HTML browser, even if it was quietly quiet.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be packed like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black white screen.
The price was very honourable: 2700 D-Mark, so it was 1400 euros.
The average price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros.
Nobody could not mention in August 1996 that the Communicator of the start of the smartphone Era would be.
Since it's all different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone party of the Finnen lived an exampleless deaster, finally sold and dealing with Microsoft.
The market rules today offerers, which all came very later than Nokia.
Always be online, this is today for very many people all day.
2015 there were about two billion Smartphone users around the world.
Selled about 1,4 billion devices, on Samsung and Apple were sold from only 555 million pieces.
The global approach with the devices is about 400 billion euros.
The good running businesses of multiple non-app-profits and the telecommunications concerts.
A whole industry has come around the smartphone.
The decisive break on the mass market came first in the beginning 2007, then Apple-head Steve Jobs on the Mac-World applied the introduction of the iPhone.
He promises three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communicator, it is easy to serve everything per touch screen.
The shop of Apple started, the iPhone is the most important product of the concern.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the visit.
They finally lost, Blackberry has to fight.
These words now have Apple and Asian offerers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-comprehensive 20 years after its finding.
In the snitt, every German today looks in between 88 times on his phone on the day.
"We all have to learn to leave the smartphone again," says Janina Kugel, in the Siemens condition of person.
Permanent availability is equal to middle long as flux and blessings.
Inglaterra needs to lead the olympical spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will not only be brought in our local communities and in all London, but in the whole country renewing and welfare.
For me, the biggest attraction Heathrows gave me this, as well as in 2012 in London, when we worked a great attorney to ensure that all our nations and regions have benefited of the games.
The olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and East end.
And this will be reached by creating new opportunities for location and companys near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will only create 10,000 new teachings, 400,000 new workplaces, and prepare a end of the unemployment in the aircraft.
As they were before us in London 2012, it will be given to those who will think that the requirement of the Heathrows extension is too large.
It was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world.
The two-fidlers were injustice 2012 and they also would be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always hinders to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question to him.
As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
The extension is an opportunity to make up to 180,000 new workplaces, £211 billion to scientific growth, and to leave a comprehensive capacity and employment for aircraft and all GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion billion team of the infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5, the five years were chosen to the world's best airport terminal until T2 was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world.
Now they are ready to provide a third step, which is supported by 16 billion £ to private investments.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am surprised that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It's time we're leaving this olympical spirit and expanding Heathrow and safeguarding our future trade and creating a comprehensiveness of efforts and employment, can be honored in England.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Boards and ancient commercial secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cast and mouse game" relating to display blocking
For companies that get money online, one of the software manufacturers try to interact display blocking is equal to a "cast and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post, in which the users could update their filters in the program to block the publication in social network.
On Sunday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding on its designs to recognize the indicator blocks of which part of the publication page.
But Adblock stated that it found a new way to turn the new codes.
In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams writes that "the kind of Hin-and-her fight between the open source Community's blocking blocks and the circuits already since the finding of display blocks is in the way", and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media undertaking has been attached to the fight is a strong indice for how interested indicators have become the broadcast.
Using a worldwide studio from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people display blocks; almost four times so much 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users, accessing on Facebook on their mobile end devices, 84 per cent of the Facebook conventions.
The company has seen it on display blocks on Desktop PCs, because mobile display blocks have no effect on Facebook mobile apps for social network and instagram, a speaker shared with.
Publication on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient major part of the income, so Facebook appears to be investment of such a step as a loyal value.
On the Sunday, Facebook shared that it would update his "Show preferences" to have more controls on them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that Adblocks would be interested in new filters because they would also block the contents on the page that are not public.
"For users, it doesn't make a positive experience, so we plan to discuss the problem," shared a Facebook speaker in an email communication.
The display blocks are a steady medium, because we have concentrated on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more controls into the hands of people.
Women in suffering self-sex on Sweden carriers
The victim was in the middle of the night on the car.
The police calls witnesses after a woman was traveled in the early morning hours on Sunday at a suicide suicide of several vehicles on a car car.
The event occurred at the A1 near Morges in Kanton Waadt shortly north.
A woman set up in the darkness "in a act of disappointment" on the streets and was found by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Sweden wanted to kill himself by 49 years of age, which were traveled by several vehicles, including a shipping.
She died before.
Many vehicles have already been taken, but some have not yet been identified, the police said that they and every witness of the case were requested to report themselves.
It was opened a remediation procedure, which is a "logical" step in such situation, shared Gilles Hofstetter with Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains expected if one of the vehicles is shown.
Was a joint dismissable?
This is something that the lawyer must decide," said the Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that the vehicles are not responsible for the responsibility.
In each of the two cases - with those who a person walked in the car car car - was decided that the vehicles shouldn't go out that one feet runs in the middle night on the car board as it was called in the magazine.
The last year, a policeman of the traveling murder was free to speak after she had traveled and killed a man in August 2014, a night at the A1 near Payerne.
The 22-year-year-old victim had drinked and was unbelieving on the street, he took the judgment.
The Court stated that the police - who had replied to a notorie -- to a justified kind and way, and that the presence of a man on the street was a "complete exciting and inheritable situation", said the judge.
Everyone who has more information about the event on Sunday near the morning should be reported to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Klimamodell: Venus was only living
The Venus was likely in the projections of a new NASA Klimamodells.
Scientific scientists in Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to detect the past of the Venus throughout tools and algorithms that are compared to climate researchers.
The model was discovered to determine whether the Venus could have shown any similar conditions with its name, without the surface and CO2-dither atmosphere.
Scientifics mentioned that the long-term conversion of Venus could be explained by their atmospheres.
But the most recent simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a dark and dark atmosphere and continued soon.
The model also lighted the topography of the previous Venus.
The planet, likely, was likely more smoking regions than the earth, but had only enough water and geographical variability to maintain life and protected faster disasters.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent of matters.
"In the GISS model simulation, the long-term turn of Venus exposes its day page of the sun almost two months long," explains the GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a pre-section.
This makes the surface and produced rains that creates a dark cloud, which works as a rain screen to grab the surface from a large part of the sunwarms.
The result is the average temperatures that some degrees are more than the earth today.
The model brought a story of the Venus, which is similar to the evolution, which has been excused by planet researchers before.
Although she was likely inhabitable, the Venus was -- for several billions of years -- too much hitze and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were disappeared and their water battle was cut off from the ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen remained only a dignity atmosphere of cool substance dioxide with a dead effect - the Venus, as we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Klimamodells in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy turned back on Sunday as trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and brought a small right to the decision process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Treaty would be searching for a new trainer.
"In the past three years I have fulfilled my obligations as Cheftrainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, suffering and sustainability," the 50-year-old Roy stated in an opinion.
I had long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depths that needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly at the organization.
He must also have a right to establish decisions affecting the loss of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who held Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for the contribution for the team.
"Patrick has reported me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate all what he did for our organization and want him to be the best for the future.
Roy was described during his debtsison in the Avalanch 2013-14 as the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the Liga.
He led the Agreement to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was slaughtered in the first round of Minnesota's Playoffs and passed the neighbouring in each of the last two years.
The Arabians described in the Saison 2015-16 a 39-39-4 mark and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the West Conference for five points.
As the Hall of Fame Torwart won Roy four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
Northern oil workers take conversations again, set the stream
The Working War on the release for North Sea Oil Working Works were issued, while all military parties were set up for a new conversation round on the table, the negotiators said.
Streaks against the Oil field service officer Wood Group were carried out on platforms in the northern sea, which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Units and the RMT companies can ensure that we have joined us to restart the development process of the current war," says it in a common opinion.
We will stop some full-day meetings in the next weeks to start the beginning of the next year to reach the problems.
The businesses said that their last streak, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible loans of 30%.
Wood Group cut the rats on its contractors in the North Sea around 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
The rating of the company is followed by a 10 per cent reduction for Ourshore Affairs in 2014.
The company said that additional cuttings to the enterprise have the required space to come through the market-building.
She has left thousands of people for his part, and plans to preach its oil and gas businesses in to 10 countries because it is ratified by its business activities as the consequences of its Megassum conclusions with the British Energy Company BG Group.
The energy enterprises have been strengthened by the lower road prices under pressure, a economic situation that has been rejected by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
The Scottic Parliament member Dave Anderson was in the beginning of this week with employees to discuss one of the greatest work efforts that were located since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few things," he said.
2016 less than 1,4 billion dollars for new projects in the North Sea are expected in average about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler misss the rotation rate of stars in the stars of the Plejades
The most recent mission with the Kepler World Room Telescope has helped astronomes to collect the complete catalog in rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades.
The new data helps the astronomes to understand why the stars rotate various rats in the stars, and in which the rotation times are related to the planet growth.
"We hope that through comparison of our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his old and even his history of his sunsystems," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a pre-section.
The stars of the Plejades are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in these stars, which have been older than 125 million years ago, are now achieved by the growth age.
They're turning their way now faster.
At the spitzen rotation rates, these raining stars struck a large number of stars in the winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnet fields of the stars, they have a breeding effect on the stars.
If a star is old, his rotation ratio is starting to suffer.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star, recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognisible star flock -- as the sun floor -- recognises.
The latest catalog of rotation rates shows that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dances, both larger stars round longer than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejadans we see that long rotors to be massive, where faster rotors are to be very brilliant," said Rebull.
Since the stars of the Plejades are so close, it serves as ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star qualities such as rotation rates.
"The stars of the Plejades provide anchor for theoretical models of the star Rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
It's still much before us we want to know more about how the way, when and why stars want their rotation rates, and then attach their "tanz shoe".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three journal reports detailed about their most recent analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will appear soon in the Astronomical Journal.
A constraint baseball state has been
The trains flew faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US-Baseball Star in best days of base to Base.
After his emotional retreat recognition, the 41-year-old profi will be carried out on August 12, against Tampa Bay Rays last time the Trikot of his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I'm saying 'Goodbye' both of them," explained the 14-mal All-Star-Game officers of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen to the most valuable player of the Liga, 2009 he won with the Yankees the World Series.
His signature under a ten-year contract protected him since 2007 27 million dollars.
At the end of the Treaty on 31 December 2017, he works in the future as a consultant and a young coach - in full sustainance.
As a player, Rodriguez paid a long time with ransom.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004), and since 2005, the Yankees made a few miles.
With the Hall off-fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays show only two other baseball players in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old 41-year-olds should not yet be taken in the baseball room.
Because so successful Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so restricted is his tracks outside the field.
For 2009, the Superstar gave the ESPN to take the steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 Parties in the biogenesis scandal in the same development.
Rodriguez is applied as main sustainable, for years over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a jurisdiction, the sperre was reduced to 162 events.
"The Liga could even have made me a happiness for 2014 because I have played 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez suffisant.
Even his absence date doesn't slow down.
While many baseball leaders in their last games were still reached the big bottles, Rodriguez had to have sometimes sitting on the bank.
"My job doesn't contain a separate tour."
"My job contains the trial to win each game," advised Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
Always Rodriguez, who was married with Cameron Diaz, and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the shoespier Kate Hudson, was married by the fans of Yankee-Erzrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the additives read at 4:9 destruction against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zelinski are first doping cases
Warning: By a positive doping test, Adrian Zielinski can not be started from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - Olympical games 2016 are overcome by the first official doping accidents.
An excited athletin had almost win a medaille.
Before the seventh warday, the first official doping cases were known to the Olympical Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese Sweeter Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters-inderny lighter Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polynical Teacher Adrian Zielinski were positive and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the critical critical competition of lightatletic concurrences comes to the time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazid was already indicated last Sunday, which is used as a massive means for doping substances.
The International Sportgerichtshof CAS confirmed at freetagnach middle day their exclusion of the Olympical Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old was the fourth place in the end over 100 m Schmetterling, only for 0,09 seconds she overrid the bronzemedaille.
At Friday, Chen should participate in the proceedings over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B test and an audience in the International Olympical Committee (IOC).
The National Communities takes the issue "the very serious and required by Chen full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua said, "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of CAS and will accept the judgment."
The first time in the history is not the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of the sporters with positive cases.
Likewise, in the night of Rio, the message on the positive test in Danekowa, the 33 - year - old age went to the open.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "a uncredit shock," she said to the French TV sender BNT.
She is innocent, "the only statement could be food complementary", explained the Lightathletin.
Following the report, it should be carried out in the prohibited substance for the EPO.
Danekowa was permanently suspended, according to BNT, the B test must be already positive.
The Bulgarian President Bojko Borissow reported the criticism in the Athletin.
"I don't understand why the sporters don't take the right keys," he said, "We are Bulgarians under observance, so many are already excluded."
Thus, all branches of the cronical doping nation cannot participate in Rio.
At Friday, the case "Adrianzielinski" was also known, the London Olimpier in the class to 85 kg was just as his brother Thomas had tried three days before at the analoid Steroid Nandrolon.
However, both will not be able to start in the class until 94 kg.
Before the beginning of the leechatelets, particularly the case of Danekowa is more difficult for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Confrontation IAAF understood the full Russian Management until a exception because of the systematical Dopings, even the Kenia's launching produced many bad news in Rio.
In the switchport, the previous procedures in China were also concerned between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang harsch.
"You're Yang pinkled."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I will betray me," said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun was also in the middle of an agreement with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for Doping-beats," said this.
Sun was 2014 with the Chinese Masterships positive on the trimetazine, but only a three-month sperre had been absited.
Dataclaw: So perfide expressed hackers their solvent
The programmers of expressing malware have currently contributed to companies targeted and are successful.
According to a current demand of malware specialists of malware bytes in 540 companies in North America, British and Germany, 40% of the companies in the past 12 months were at least one time, partly more of the victims of an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, about 20 per cent of the company has already been a goal of ransomware expression.
40 per cent of the victims paid properly the solvents required by the tattoos to reuse the attached systems and data.
The tattoos specificize their expressor software according to the observations of malware bytes, in view of attaques in business networks.
If it succeeded there, the potential to pregnant solution is clearly higher than in private users.
"We now watch a terrible quick evolution of the smooth software," explains Malwarebytes chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "Welt".
2008, most malware programs were still issued to send publication.
Then the tattoos discovered the expression software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to business taxes successed quickly in the past months.
Ransomware works after a simple pattern: Once on the computer of a victim is active, it seeks the most recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the original.
Then the software presents the requirements of the expressor.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims of money - most need to be transmitted in the form of the Bitcoin encryption.
However, where private users have the personal photo database on the game, the companys are to be sensitive customer data or project databases, without silence of the production.
In the same way, the worms will be exceeded when a ransomware is attached.
22 per cent of the German companies concerned reported by Ransomware losses, 13 per cent of the business had to be completely interrupted, in one case people were in life risk.
In Germany there were already several disease victims of attacks, which could have been aware of the loss of diseases.
"We always say to the victim: Don't pay, you're helping only the problem," says Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies who pay their data reach their data.
For the manager, it is difficult to deny the request of the manager in view of silence in the operation.
The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the security researchers of F-Secure have studied the users and the contact with the explorers and come to the result: The taxers are actually trying to build a kind of client service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, correct free accessible support websites, or decipher immediately example files.
And privacy leaders will be solved by payments of a few hundred euros, enterprises must be fully negotiated and paying five-system sums to reach their data without encryption.
In view of the potential higher and relatively riskless wines from the ransomware expression, the hacker will always be professional and shared the work, explains the security expert Chester Wisnewski from the antivirus provider sophos: "A individual person can write a ransomware about a week."
However, it is likely that it is three or four persons.
Programers then sold their shadow software in the form of a software bacteria to the real expressor.
The preceding malware kits were sold by buying the malware itself, consultation and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"In the beginning of living is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, views and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The expressors then look for more hackers to expand the fresh incoming software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are logged in one of the forms underground, buys the seat of a crime and offers another way to install software on most PCs.
The payment is successful for infected host.
"In general, the crimes will be increasing, then spather with the divorce," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is middle often known in many companies that better ensure their data.
Over 50 per cent of the company-IT responsibilities in the malware bytes reaches ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Thus, the taxers have already followed new strategies.
"When the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful achievement, the tattoo is in place with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-header Marcin Kleczynski.
This is the suffering potential, as a type of data, even a lot of higher than previously.
The tattoo could also take new objectives in the Internet on the corn.
On the Hacker Conference, Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the free movement of a kind of blocked heating could be so many sacrifices through a solvent.
If the tattoo is then blocking a whole preparation street in a manufacturer instead of heating in the future, Ransomware may also be a subject in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and all day
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to package everything: a little SUV, a little coffee, and even the violence of a Minivan.
It sounds seriously overloading, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually shown as flexible in all day.
Although only 1,60 m higher HR-V is smaller, the passors have also been in the first row and in the ground a lot of space, it does not affect any place.
The materials of the internal room are well processed and active, only the cockpit top page falls something.
More than comparable vehicles are the HR-V at the stage.
It is not only a copper room of 453 l at higher and 1026 l in the range of backlines, but there is the "Magic Seats".
It's less magic than it sounds: the seats of the backbank are high as kinosessel and offers a stairy from the ground to the bottom of 1,24 m.
The coffee room can be loaded well, however, the load height with 650 mm is something higher than in comparable peugeot 2008.
The top 1,6-l disease with 88 kW/120 PS describes the HR-V, thanks to the rotation mode from to 300 Nm in ranges of rotation, very powerful.
But he had to make his work more easier.
The whole day consumption of 4,7 l/100 km is happy.
There is another motorisation: a 1,5-l-banciner with 96 kW/130 PS.
A aircraft is not offered.
The travel behavior is exhausted, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But it should be something directer.
The exhibition is not allowed to open in the top-variant "Executive".
The security systems include the City Not Brems assistant (employed to time 32), the collision warning system and the Spurhouse assistent.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assessss many delays as "herent objects".
The television assistant works very easily.
And the intelligent time ruler reacts to the trading character recognition and disturbs the speed when needs.
But the full connectivity is only for the top-up: 7-Zoll touch screen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the army, and therefore they are able to achieve something.
The total 29000 euros for the good equipped tops are allocated.
Whoever doesn't want to invest so much, receives the benziner from 20000 euros, diel from 23000 euros.
The engines fulfil the Euro-6-abgas standard.
With HR-V, Honda offers a viselitistic and all-day car.
Airline doesn't wait: Shooting on airports
A airline does not wait for the shooting of a pasteur on the airport.
Since a challenge is only in dangers that are typically for air transport, the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf argumented (e.g.: 18 U 124/14).
The shooter broke a shooter in the steel.
However, the accident could happen all the time - it is a general risk of life, so that the Court.
The flight company didn't pay the man's worries.
Disease case: When the event is paid
Her sick urubers get back after their journey only when the cause of disease is probably free in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the treaty case, a family in the second day of her Turkish turkish labour had severe diseases and crimes.
She's almost disappeared the whole place in the room.
Their disease returned to a defect clanning which, likely, the sea water broke.
The family was the view that the travel was missing - and struggled against the staff.
The judges had no success before the judge.
In fact, the clanning was defected.
However, the congressman was only shortly found before the accommodation of the claims.
He had to say that the sea water was okay.
He did not hurt his information obligations, so the judgment.
No pollution cleansed once in the water tests.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by attaching each other - is generally the risk of life.
From 691 hosts only 38 were sick.
The Maizière said that after the soldiers in Würzburg and attorneys in July, many people would have worried about further advantages.
The State must be solved and decided to react to territorial issues.
Certainly, our country will not answer the violence of the taxers with hat and colonship.
This triumph will not be pleased to the terrorists.
If criminals need to quickly leave the country, it increases security and strengthens the agreement of the population for the flight policy.
The Maizière wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until 2017.
He also announced further personal strengthening of security forces, and however, "in the average quarter-quality regulation over several years."
The sympathesis for the terrorism must remain under crime.
Video monitoring should be improved to reinforce the weapons right so that, in particular, the purchase of weapons in the Internet.
The most recently discussed duty for doctors should be protected after Maizière's words.
However, in the dialogue with the medicine, he wants to find solutions as to reduce the danger of the citizens, he said, as well as at psychic skills.
In order to enhance radiakalization of flights, the Ministry provides a better social behaviour for the need.
Learning forces should be prepared better for traumatised people.
To persecution of crimes in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), Maizière provides the use of detected ermittlers.
SPD-head Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to speak about everything that is important to increase security further."
It is important that the Ministry of Internal has expressed clearly against Actionism.
"This was a surface for the CDU/CSU card maker," Gabriel said to the journals of the functional media group (freetag).
The Maizière had rejected the call from the Union after a Burka-promise and the decrease of the duplicate State.
A general prohibition of the fulfillment has been issued for the law of consideration.
You can't provoke everything you're dismissed, and I'm leaving the train of Burka.
You can talk about rules or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chefin Simone Peter foretold to the Ministry, he wants to simulate a new anti-terror package active and operational ability.
The left-party Bernd Riexinger said, "Flotte Springs and a discharge of the maintainment rights will not make the people in this country any more security."
Best transport flow on the car rental
It becomes regularly on the circuit street - here a picture from November.
However, it should be amended: the requirement of law shall be extended.
This is a good news for all car travelers who stand in the office traveling every night in the board when they go over the car travel (A 43).
The country's office of Street Building is extended on the next Sunday and Western (16./17 August) in the area between the chairway and the traveling of Weseler Straits the jurisdiction for 700 meters.
Auto vehicles can then be directly attached from the hammer straight right.
The greater price: the transport shares early in order to improve the entire investment in the multiple rate section of the 51.
The idea with the long-term experience had the CDU Fraction in the Bezirk Representation of Munster West.
The driving driving on the board is nervous by the vehicles in particular between 17 and 19.00.
Working day, the back stage is enough until the bridge over the Albersloir way and sometimes out of it.
The reason is the narrow on the B 51 short before the department of Weseler Street.
From here the transport will only be carried out on the bus.
The second shop had to be built back for three-four years ago.
The reason: Statistic calculations have stated that the briefs have no longer the needed tragedy force to be doubled in particular.
The competent country industry can not say how long this passenger and the employment that is connected to it is.
However, it is to be calculated for years: because the bridge has a official remaining time until 2034.
For the extension of the legal request, the country's employee has understood the transitional time in schools because it is to calculate with restrictions.
The transport will be carried out on Sunday and Middle Wednesday at the building.
Intercultural travel: Culture offers for schools
The International Class of the Wald School visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The Agreement of Nima's and the young theater now plans a music project.
The Agreement allows young people with migration and flight background to visit cultural institutions in Munster.
The "Clase International" of the Wald School Children's house has visited a presentation of the price-screen piece "The Invisible House" of the young Theaters Munster.
In the context of the "intercultural route" initiated by the United Nations, 19 students visited the incentive in small house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the Agreement offers the cultural integration of young people with migration and flight background to go to schools with welcome classs in the framework of this project cultural institutions in Munster.
Most of the youths of the class are from September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afganistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Mountster and speak little Germany.
Thanks to the croreography, the Chinese images and video animations, it was possible to follow the process of action, so the Pression of the young Theaters Munster.
The Agreement Nima's, based by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theater will cooperate in the future time of a music theater project.
From October to December, youths with and without flight and migration backgrounds should receive the opportunity to visit professional curses in the areas of singing, dance, shopping and music.
The offers for children and family in the area of theater game and theatralic language disorders are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Road" continues.
In view of the increased flight numbers, the Agreement is calculated with many classs that want to participate.
Rows instead of shopping stars: Hope to weather improvement
The weather has made the stereo-snippet guckers in South-West Germany night to freetage, but there is still hope.
The night was worthy of clouds and rains to watch the sky spectacle, said the President of the Star War Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the evening to Saturday.
The weather will be good, then we will certainly see a lot of stars in the sky.
At the star shoes, it is about persides that are with 216,000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star shoes.
They have their names because they seemed to come out of the stell image Perseus that appears in the north.
Hot night: Tips against bed disorders
Tonight, you want to go forever, tonight you're going to grow for hours, and tomorrow is far from the weather clinger, you don't think more about sleep.
That's all else than heavy.
Always, with such problems in good society: According to Robert Koch Institute, a fourth of the adult dreams and more than ten percent receive their dream often or longer than hard.
How are the problems of sleep or sleep diseases?
There are several forms of sleep diseases, and it can be based on multifail reasons, named Hans' night weight, member of the German society for sleep research and sleep medicine.
What you understand is farmerly, but the insomnie is, so a disaster of sleep.
Moreover, many people are inadequate or inadequate to sleep, says Jens' car knecht, members of the German budget contract with Praxis in the near-sex.
What's going on behind sleep diseases?
The causes of sleep diseases are complex.
Instead, organic, psychic or behavior factors can be able to steal medically.
Not weird is the dreaming expression of another disease.
"The very early survey is most often in a depression," says weight.
And it can be that various factors are launching each other.
For example, one who has a band shopping event can be bad, waiting for two to three hours and may begin to greed over all day problems and sorts, gives a example.
This leads to slow, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you sleep with the doctor?
He who doesn't sleep good for a month at least three nights per week and is attempt at the day, should go to the doctor.
The concentration may look very different: it is cut off, wet, sleep, has difficulties with attention and concentration, it is easy to review, has vote smokes or corporate disasters such as magnitude or head pains.
In order to lead sleep disorders, it is important to find their reasons.
As treatment options, other changes of behavior, cognitive treatment or medicine - classic sleep tablets are only in the exception and at least for two weeks - infraction.
The low-living medicine is not in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, leader of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charity University Medicine Berlin.
That is why you should first turn to the household in sleep problems, weight.
It can explain with studies whether the problems have a body reason.
Who should be in the slap flavor, and what's going on?
For the investigation in the slaflabor medicine, for example, in scars with attempts, in disease daily disorders, in sleepers, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorders, she explains feet.
You don't really need to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Don't just sleep at lunch," said Fietze.
After the challenge, you go to his normal time to bed.
Besides the electrods on the body, you take a nasenbrill, a brush, and a flight on the finger.
Moreover, a camera on the deck shows the sleepers.
How can the problems be involved in the grief?
There are very many smiles that you can fix for a better sleep.
Wednesday is: regular sleep- and up-times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, don't look at sleep, alcohol, and not looking at the night - then you begin to calculate immediately, and it's not very useful.
What's to do with missing mediles in smoking
The former German Swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself by Facebook to destruct the DSV team in Olympic.
In December 2014, he first received gold in Doha in the short-term world offices and put his first world record in the same time.
Now the ancient DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has been protected by Facebook before his ex-group colleagues standing in the critic.
"In a country where an olympian reaches 20,000€ premie and a thrown King 150,000€ should be wondered about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old night at the Facebook site.
The support system in the swimmsport is bad, the doping controls are very good.
We can't competite with countries that promote a lot of efforts and not looking at the Doping subject or even affecting it.
"I don't say that the controls should be set here," he further explained.
If he had started a comback, Debiler should have been reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's the same way you should keep it with countries.
"When a certain time before WM/OS can not be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA/FINA, you can't participate," requests the election-Hamburger, which is the middle of the east.
Airports: packaging bands
Professional diebe on the airport Düsseldorf
Cultivators of the Düsseldorfer Police had the fiction of two women and two men in age of 50 to 61 years.
The fact that they had been a band of various tickets and tickets.
At 21.30 hours, citizens in the airport Düsseldorf recognised a band that was known to the police from the past debts.
The two women and two men have passed in several parts since July this year, and they have been common, working and specially professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 may demonstrate the debts that were intended to reach crimes to Germany.
They were totally built over 15,000 euros.
Altbauts, a couple of linen trees, between a rest of headstone plants: The Riger Streets in Berlin-Fridrichshain does not affect the first view, but the police counts them to the "Security places" of the city.
If you go through the east streets to the west, you'll come to game places, a fresh-screen kids garden and a bioload.
At the fasad of a green house, someone's "hessily!" smells.
In accordance with a member that will also be departed soon, it will be already built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new meetings.
Articles about this "third cities" as the competent immobility company called Peace Richshain, however, in the past weeks, will be prevented with burning cars.
The reason is the house with 94: One time it was, middle often the resident contracts have been established, but there are still spaces and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel had expressed a number of times from the beginning of the year for a hard progress of the police against the project, which was called "no-go-zone" for police and 94 as a result of autonome violence.
On June 22, the rooms in the landscape, the chadsmide, with 300 police offices, patrouilized the police three weeks after official issues with 30 to 40 officers and three travel cars, closed the parts of the streets and held the visitors from the house with 94.
During the renewed building workers in the job of unknown households the rooms.
On 13 July, a Berlin Officer decided that the room was illegal, and a day later police and builders went down under the jubel of sympathians and inhabitants.
On this Sunday, the streets work peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the citizens before the houses in the sun, and others are in the way.
In direct near the house projects, there is a basic school and children gardens.
Left violence is not the main sort of many inhabitants: Kerstin New Gebauer, who lives since 1999 in Kiez, and Jana* who grows up here three children are particularly generated by the policy presence.
The residents of the house projects share the worst concerns and geneticization.
It doesn't sound after a choice that most of the policy uses forwarded links.
The grave that the Berlin Innensenator and the police are opened between households and their neighbors does not exist so clearly.
Friedrichshain in the east Berlin was actually a traditional worker quarter which has also today in comparison with the rest of the city a small average income and high poverty risk.
In 1990, many households have been placed in the old DDR, and nearly all major streets were close to the river.
While the Maintainers were dreamed under a great policy order in a regular straight battle, many of the projects were legalized in the river and are still still lived by the people who had been placed 26 years ago.
In the same time, the part of the city has become a magnete for tourists and electronics from all the world: now they share inhabitants from DDR and former households their choice.
This is also noted by the measures that have been increased at about 60 per cent of renewed meetings since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the riger will be attacked as symbols for this development: You recognize them in incoming skins or freshly stretched fases that have been covered with colored tables.
No other streets have been mentioned this year so often with the words "left sautonome violence".
There is a reason that not all the neighbors consider that a problem, they may not be independently affected by criminality: crimes such as the body pollution are just ahead of statistics only against the police.
The largest part of the crimes makes cases that are tendencyly achieved by the new buildings and fresh renoved houses.
For Kerstin New Gebauer, who lives in a miethouse near the 94 constraints, can not be talking about unsecurity.
What the guarantees do, she is serious: the people in the 94s are their neighbors who are not certain.
Even the famous cars that burned, it's not longer in the rigers.
For the studied architectine, their streets are no criminal burning point, in the same way: "There you help one another, live together on the street and get more of each other than whereever."
Rebuilding is conscious to the Riger Street and remained.
It was therefore important that the residents reach their streets: from the police, the policy and the media, which all in July injury was in the declaration of the city part.
However, in the eyes of residents as a new building, the streets will continue to be taken away from them: through unseen new buildings in ancient builders that devour the old inhabitants.
"These are the final property apartments that are not interested for many here - live here more people who are not so good," says they.
"Worldness and destruction I can't absolutely bear good."
But what should you do if anyone doesn't hear?
It is also on all sides of Frustration, also in the police and inhabitants.
For adjudications that argue over the colors, Kerstin Newbuyer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes are the choice.
Whoever appears should be aware of that - exactly as a person who walks in a neighborhood can be worried about the dream.

Urbach: Annika Gottchle is a new flight task
Annika Gottchle is the vocational partner in business Integration and Organizator.
Furthermore, she is a social worker.
Since July, Annika Godchle is the flight payment for urba.
The Social Padagogin supports the management team on Achim Grockenberger.
She looks as an advisory partner for all actors: flights, workscreas Flight support, administration, authorities and others.
Regine customers of the workscreen indicate that the honourables are more grateful than Godchle now is the empty wild milk sauce which has in particular a problem.
Thus, some - less slow than much at the number of requested task areas - commonly as the administration wanted to write the position.
It was searched for an administrative capacity with a talent for languages and people, linked to a long-year experience in the social work, and also an emphasisable wealth.
However, the administrative work is not your central area, says Annika Gottchle.
In particular, it goes to the organization, work with people in place, and also behind the cuts and the network activities.
The 31-year-old is about six weeks ago.
She refreshed a 50%-style for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine customer that Annika Gottchle supports honour- and main-time acts.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and comprehensive problems.
Slowly, new containers are in the water street
A serious problem is from some time to find rooms for the aircraft recognised.
The communities are competent for the cluster.
You must enter the flights in their own or assigned rooms.
The costs for the building, the middle or the renewing of these undertakings must take the communities itself.
The responsibility changes from the ground-General to the community and the job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but none of them wants to offer his apartment.
The search has become very difficult since some time.
The fact that the administration does not find private apartments.
It isn't worker until you are shown in private apartments, so Godchle.
Therefore, common rooms must be strengthened, as it is so beautiful.
So immediately, new containers will be established in the water street.
But it's not done with rooms.
Perspective is the word, Regine customers and Annika Godchle are one.
Besides a fixed level, practical places, training facilities, school places, un-European workshops and assistance for flights and migrants that must be found or established.
"More places would be good," reported Regine Customer.
Many work in the buildhouse or help home masters, a common work, and that motivates and very correctly, as Annika Godchle reports.
She hopes that the work for the Community brings to a positive external effect.
It's "no employment treatment".
Activity doesn't mean only work.
The day needs a fixed structure, says Godchle and customer.
People have to develop a relationship feelings.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with inhabitants and all language courses.
Professional courses are hard.
So there are also managers and honors.
It's central that the flights have the feeling of being in Germany and welcome.
The long time of the procedure is a problem.
You have to explain to the flights that it also ends and they can exceed the time, for example, with language courses.
Whoever develops the feeling, he can help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useful, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority has been motivated.
However, there is also problems, says the customer honestly, "Leutes, with which nothing goes." The work of Godchle and customer is therefore even to motivate others.
It's just a "mammut".
A difficult question: Do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like urbach?
"No," says Regine customers very clearly, "what some can be called naiv." A restriction can be able to, but it doesn't want to exclude.
But the helpers are sensitively.
These cases are also the subject of the flights.
They were afraid that the attentives would bring them completely into the challenge.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main- and honor-heroes must be maintained in the region after actions.
They've always been in the background that soon a new lot of flights and migrants could come to Urbach.
Are you sure to Germany?
This question is clearly answering, the policy is dismissed.
Actually, it's impossible to make them help.
"In urbach we're not yet here where we're looking for," says Annika Gottchle.
No new flights, that would disappear the situation.
Regine customer also makes clear that the citizens have already been carried out to integrate the previous people.
These are around 100 people, overwhelming young men.
But if people are in concern, you need to help them, both women are one.
The political worldwide is so complicated, there is no simple answers.
Shooter: Find shooters with shooter
The police smoker fled along a few hours of various areas - unfortunately.
Two unknown men are held on Friday morning against 8.50 hours violently in a apartment in a multi-family house in the line.
The inhabitants surprised both of them and smoked the detention in the flight.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 meters large, well masked, both bluejeans and black capusin pulls.
They fled in the town.
The police set up several training rates and a policy rubber.
The challenge has lost unfortunately.
Eventually, the unknowns fell before the reality near the apartment at their flight.
