Inflation, in Europe, has declined on food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly increased by the rapid increase of food prices.
In November, the increase of prices, in 13 euro area countries, was more important in respect of the provisions, after an inflation level of 2,6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent was registered, indicated the office of the statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official previsions only indicated 3 per cent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the Central Banks of America, British and Canada, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not decreased that the reduction of interests, with the growth of the prices of the first material and the low rate of cooling, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but nearly two percent.
According to an analytical, Catch 22 is the ECB: "We need to dissuad" inflation, so that we should not have any more intervention on this issue.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3,3 per cent is a record during the past 12 years and in Spain, it is replaced from 3,6 to 4,1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined from the rapid increase of food and energy prices.
Current market costs have increased 88% and the soja course has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and latiar products has also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global price of the petrol increased 52% and, last month, a black gold barle costed almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will be over 2.1, this year, at 2.5 per cent but, in 2009, will be low to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3%, however, at the next 3 to 4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect to reduce the ECB two times in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long-term stage, the number of participants of Fidesz (Aliance of Young Democratics) has significantly increased in December. Thus, since 2002, there is currently a larger number of partisans, while Gallup (Institute of Sundage) has never constated before such a lower social support, to know 13 per cent.
For faithful electors, the difference would represent, due to the greatest determination of the opposition electorers, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Ungarn Socialist Party).
According to the Sundage, the MDF (Four of Hungarian Democrates) and the SZDSZ (Free Democracy Alliance) are under the parliamentary level: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On certain faithful electors to go to vote, the number of partisans of the two parties increased 1 per cent.
The Economic climate continued to deteriorate in relation to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who have judged that the economic situation of the country was particularly seriously not exceedingly higher than 41 per cent and 46 per cent of supplementary situation is so serious.
After the most optimist perspectives of the printemps and the last year, the families are more pessimists than their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population provides a aggravation and only one decade provides a improvement of the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of the sounded persons, to know a majority never seen in the previous gallup songs, have judged that the first Minister had done his work as bad as well.
13 per cent of the summers have trusted or much of trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 per cent supporting Viktor Orban.
54 per cent does not trust the first Ministry and 27 per cent of the President of Fidesh.
One of the indicators of the change of the political situation is the proportion of the society thinking that the disagreement of the first Minister may be treated without government change.
While after the last October emergency, 35 per cent of the sounds wished that the Government and the First Ministry remain in function, this rate represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) estimates that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
At the issue of vote intention, 60 per cent of the sounds say that they would certainly go to vote, and the 20 per cent of supplementars say that they would likely vote.
In order to compare the comparison for a "legal election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the sounds would have participated certainly, and 15 per cent of supplementary per cent would possibly participate. Following the current intentions, the result of the reference would not be doubtful.
74 per cent of people would not say to the rights of inscription in the higher education, 79 per cent would say not to consultation costs and 84 per cent would not say to the hospital's residence prices.
When we only consider the same proportions among people who have expressed their intention to vote to the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would refuse the introduction of inscription rights, consultation costs and payments to the hospital.
Auchan is the lovingest, Tcos increased his price of nearly 20%
The hypermarked in the Budaörs trade triangle has maintained the average increase of prices of 16% of the last year in the difference that the tax of the TVA has not increased this year.
Article of the Day Economy (a day economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the Department of Normal Noël has also increased 16% in average, a increase of value was exceedingly higher than thousands of forensics in all hypermarkets.
The prices, “who had already been involved” in the large food stores last December, have not increased brutally in respect of the previous higher basis.
However, consumers are obviously tried to see that the articles purchased just below nine thousand forensics in the last year are now costing more than 10 thousand forensics.
The Daily Paner in the sunmarked hypermarks has exceeded 91 forensics, at least, the psychological area of ten thousand forensics.
And the highest value of the panier was mounted to 10 573 forenses.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forensics.)
The prices of the Unicum and the live fishing have almost remained at the level of the last year, however, the prices of the dining, the nine and the pool have increased strongly.
In the magazines, the price of the farine and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but in Aucan, we found a pain from a kilo to 139 forensics.
The competition has not lowged the price of the product below 200 forensics.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle designed by two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forensics, it was therefore not costing that 257 forests the consigned bottle that includes.
Only this year, at the end of the day Panar, Auchan was the lovingest and Cora's less favorite.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his day Panor of 15 per cent when Tスコ and Aucan increased them respectively from 18 and 18 per cent.
By comparing the lateest painter of the last year and the lateest of this year, we are a 12% scale, while the difference between the less beauty of the last year and the most dearest of this year is 21%.
The prices have increased from 1 480 forenses in average.
The last year, the prices increased from 1 206 in average forenses, while knowing that the impact of the increase of the TVA was already marked in the prices of the last year.
This process has perplexed the trade, the hypermarkets could not determine visiblely what margin to apply on products as they were impossible to prevent the impact of the change of prices on consumption.
(If a trader calculates badly the rotation of a product, it risks to lose a great benefit on the adjusted margin to the intensity of the trade.)
Since the change of the TVA level, the increase of the prices of the quotidian Paner has developed so exceeding that the most precious panier was above 1 720 former than 2006, while the difference between the less favorite paniers was only 844 forenses.
This year, the difference was not so excessive because the value of the most dear panier was greater than 1 630 forests in the last year and the prices of the less love increased from 1 284 forenses.
In the nearby two Noël investments, we have constructed a catastrophic increase of prices, at least 20 months the prices of the quotidian consumption articles have increased more than 30% in hypermarkets.
(This does not ensure that the data of KSH is not strongly confirmed: for some of the first needs, the statistical institution has increased more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case for example of farine and oeuf.)
According to the quota-day Panor of this last, this appears almost absurd because the price level of this product, already cut up the last year, increased by more than 10 per cent in relation to the basis.
According to the indications, farm providers have a stronger position than oil providers because they have successfully accepted the brutal increase of prices also by multinational.
In the trade triangle of gold, the hypermarkets do not plan, they are constantly recording good years.
According to our experiences, most clients do not see prices in the three visited hypermarket.
They buy all in quantity, they take long conservation foods by palettes.
Morning morning of the important cows were formed in the boxs of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers has increased brutally.
However, according to our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinational societys are intended to not even achieve the number of businesses provided, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption articles.
Many hospitals have the economy on desinfects
This year, more than thousand infections, mainly caused by the wrong use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the supervision of medical personnel does not help to block infections, indicate the doctor in the National Epidemology Centre.
Many hospitals also make economy on desinfects
No longer a MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the traumatological service of Janos hospital.
An antibiotic bactery was detected on a hospitalized man after a serious accident.
The disease has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The worst of a serious car accident was out of the hospital but a little time after there was returned by a MRSA infection and, since, doctors couldn't make him an important operation because of the bactery that is in his body.
Since 10 December of this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by a multiresistent agent was declared to the National Nation of Neokomyal Surveillance System, Karolina Böröcz, doctor of the National Centre of Epidemology.
It is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistent pathogen agent who has been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
At least two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, otherwise said by the staphylococus gold residents in the meticilline-oxacilline.
One third of the people are portors of the Staphylococus golden bactery (SA) in their nose without developing a disease.
The infections caused by the SA (like angles, amygdalites, cutaned infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healthy.
However, if antibiotics are used excessive or inadequately, the bactery, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well resistant bactery to antibiotics who will rapidly prolifer in the bad hospital conditions.
In the case of bad provisional or long-term functions of the immune system, this bactery may cause serious hospital infections such as traumatic infections or seeds, on older diseases, small povertys or with an available body.
According to the doctor Janos hospital director, there is nothing particularly in the MRSA infections, these infections are part of the day of the hospital.
It is not particularly necessary to confusion the infection with the epidemy, we don't find MRSA only it or we don't look for it, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA is responsible for antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the employer has caoutchouc and protection masks and we have antibiotics adjusted to laugh them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Priorly, hospitalised diseases are considered if they are porters of MRSA, however, infection cannot always be evident.
The preliminary of the style is not in the mode
The majority of MRSA-infections may be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent development and proliferation of multi-restaurant pathogen agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection appears especially in hospitals and residences for older persons, hospitals should control hospitalised diseases and immediately isolate MRSA portory diseases.
However, microbiological preliminary is not in the mode in Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the National Social Security Case does not finance these tests.
Most of the cases see the day that if MRSA infection is detective on the disease, the doctor in the head of the epidemological center said.
The European Union has rigourous recommendations relating to adjusted human antibiotics and there are also Hungria's directives for the health of certain infections and syndromes.
The antibiotic treatment should be achieved, otherwise, microbiological tests should be performed to prevent resistence to medicines, but the hospitals do not always take account of it.
The realization of microbiological preliminaries is still more rare in the ambulance and in the basic care, have communicated Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals have the economy on desinfects
Scientific evidence show that MRSA has caused a disease to another most often by the medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to lay the hands, to put gas and protection masks. However, important lakes are also detected in the hospitals in this area.
MRSAs prolifered by infection transmitted by inhalation of goatlets and contacts, however, because of conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the consumed disease can not always be isolated.
Moreover, the salts are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while the diseases should be removed one of the other from 1,5 metres at the minimum.
Unfortunately, we also convince that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, make economy on desinfects, they miss infringements, diseases are many, so the risk of pollution is still greater, indicated Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is lowly devisible or then the proliferation of the pathogen agent can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbiting expenditures for social security boxes, so it is reasonable to fight partly against this infection.
In English, for example, the Government has established a programme to prevent or reduce MRSA's incident.
According to the data published, this programme is effective and MRSA infections show a tendency decreasing in England.
The European Prevention and Control Centre of Diseases (ECDC) shows the priority of prevention of the incident of multi-resistent pathogen agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogen agents.
The Commissioner, the author of a dead accident, was not in the state of urgency.
The official constat on the mortal accident caused by the commissary of 22th ransom was deprived.
It may be excluded that the commissary of 22th ransom, demissioner of his post since, who exalted a pioneer in carrying his last march, had been conducted in a state of thirty or extortion, had communicated Friday Attila Morvai, port-word of the public Ministry of the capital after the related constat was established.
The constat confirmed the first result of the investigation that has already stated that the ex-commissary had not consumed alcohol before he was able to fly
Last March, the chief of the commissariat of 22th arrondised a 55-year-old man who found his face when he turned, with his personal car, in the Cossuth Lajos Street of 22th arrows. The man wanted to travel the road without pass for pietons.
(In addition, the fact that he traveled outside the travel for pietons does not constitute an attentive circumstance, according to the Code of the Road, a car that loves a virgin must leave the pietons.)
The pioneer was dead after he was transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner sent his post and asked his retreat because, according to the police communication, this accident was very amazing.
The investigation on this matter is carried out by the Parquet loaded by Budapest investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the ex-commissary had cooperated from the beginning with the judges loaded to carry out the investigation.
400 million additional euros for infrastructure
Janos Veres, Minister of Hungarian Finances, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI), signed, Friday, in Budapest, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (BEI) adopted a budget of 300 million euros for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to realize from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties, and this time the contract is signed on the use of 200 million euros remaining.
The Agreement on the credit of 150 million euros also concerns the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB totally approved a total of 300 million euros for Hungary, 150 million remaining euros may be used later, after the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will first use this entry in the framework of research and development project to achieve the University of Debrecen.
In negotiations, the draft of line 4 of the metro has also been attached.
The parties agreed that they would renew the eventually amendment of the initial contract when Hungary has finished the details of the funding of the EU.
According to Janos Veres, this could be done on the first trimestre 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB granted EUR 8,4 billion total for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB provides its credits according to the interest rate related to EURIBOR, with a period of appreciation for 8 years and without a committee.
Bulgaria, EU's immobilier market paradise
The evolution of Bulgarian immobilier market is spectacular, and the attention of all Europe is turned to this few Balkans countries in the past.
What, or who's buying on this EU market, which is always the less favorable but who will be quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the immobilier, Bulgaria is the most objective of East Europe with its apartments of ski and its houses at the top of the good market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovc, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and, on the sea side, Albena, the "Old Sables", the "Saturday Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are more to search for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria, early or later, the central region of the country, to know Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also exceed the interest of investors, and they are also more than more to buy in the very little love of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, offers opportunities also attracting, trade and office surfaces pronounce the highest rate of immorality.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and so to be a priority destination, after the earlier saison and the hiver saison, also in the two other income of the year.
The most monitoring investors are already buying in many, for example in Bansko's coast.
According to the analysists, people who buy a building in Bulgaria soon look forward to change their life, their life mode.
Most of the purchasers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more in Romania.
Malta and chipriote investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most reputed ski stations, we will traditionally meet many Russian accommodators.
Foreign purchasers are divided in three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are fully installed are buying renewed buildings in a varied price between 50 to 100 000 euros or older houses, to a price of 5 to 15 000 euros, which then are renewed.
The criteria are the easy access and communication opportunities, the nearby of a large city, magazines, and generally the local doctor.
The second group includes purchases of secondary residents (see last December, Bulgaria was citated among the 10 first vacances in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a more average or long-term value.
The price of the capital buildings increases without stoping the fact of a more stronger and more demand.
In the European Union, immobilier prices are the lower in Bulgaria, however, these five years have increased 21 percent each year.
The increase of immobilier prices is essentially exceeding the increase of payments.
Fodor and six percent of Hungary
According to the Communication of Gabor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals will be held March, however, after the official opening, the negotiations of Ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and political men from 192 countries of the world will discuss on the Bali Road Feed to determine the efforts to do after the reduction period of the emissions defined by Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this time, live discussions are addressed to this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also stated that, for the time, they would not discuss exact numbers, but they were ready to sign a agreement on reduction, until 2020, gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent in relation to the level of 1990.
Another important subject of the Conference is to see whether developed countries are inadequate, outside reduction of emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries needed.
A agreement was also signed on support to provide developing countries.
The assistance fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be supported by an administrative advice of 16 members in the framework of the Global Fund for the United Nations Environment (GEF), reported Piac and Profit (Marché and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, Gabor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the ambition of the EU confirms to maintain its role in global efforts to protect climate and encourage the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Ministry explained that the EU was intended to reduce its gas emissions in fact 2020 in relation to the level of 1990, independently from the success of the signature of the 2012 Agreement, and it was prepared to reduce them to 30%, if the other large regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to take adjustments to their responsibility and capacity.
Gabor Fodor reminded that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signing countries had totally vised a reduction of 5,2 per cent and the entire of the 15 members of the EU in this period have taken the rate of 8 per cent in less.
Hungary has committed to reduce the gas emissions of 6 per cent in relation to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will complete its commitment, and reminds the Communication of the Ministry of Environment.
The enjoy is great in Bali because the international long-term climate policy agreement should be established in the period of two years, except the entry in force of the Agreement would be permanently retained after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the values provided in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international international reduction system of emissions which the need was submitted in the new IPCC report, scientific body, which obtained the United Nations peace price, would not immediately follow the climate change.
The reduction of the emissions would be retard and the increase of the average temperature of the Earth of more than 2 cellular grades could not be excessive that, according to scientists, would have extremely severe and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
The United States of the British Army communicate, on the website of video party, records made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British air force (RAF) that has been passive for YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan carrying video sequences on the operations made against Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These records, taken by the boarding cameras on the box, are controlled in the general area of air force operations to Kandahar and then transferred to London or compatriots carried them on the Internet.
The political message is incompatible
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this road and their "chaine" has been looked for more than 75,000 people.
The Ministry of British Defence was written under the name of "Defenceheadquarters" in 2007 and communicated videos on the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of Commonwealth (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own challenges on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial purpose of the air force, videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also had to know the real objectives of the presence of the Army in the foreign.
The propagand published by this route does not usually cost anything about the publicities of normal recruitment passed on the TV, which communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence. It is also inevitable to bring a political message, since it is justified in a special form the well-based area of military operations decided by the Government.
Americans made a game
The army is built because, hormised and censured videos, Amateur videos are passed on the party site, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propagande films, a little hypocrites, the officers will never be able to talk about loss, but they never present the blood side of the battle.
Moreover, many videos have already been passed on the network presenting the operation areas in Iraq and Afghanistan which were made in real mission, but the British Army has not been built for the loading of these videos a little.
America's recruitment makes a little differences in serving the American Army's fusillad game freely downloaded. In this game the player can be directly placed on the place of soldiers in the frame of a more or less real simulation.
Noël tombola and branches in the ministry
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Working, doesn't seem to be feeling: instead of celebrating Noël, she will have a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say additional to 2007 by take feasts and coffee.
Another ministry will organise a party with living music, and another one will change the officials with a tomb and offer a grain to create a Noël's ambiance.

The NFÜ Noël costed 4 700 000 forensics and was organized in the construction of the National Court of Justice (OIT) with concerts and a dinner.
The location of the room costs a million foreigners, the rest was expensed for over four hundred invitations.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another party of Noël, which is organized with the European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the Management Society of Opinions.
The building of the Gaita's Teatro has been delighted for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we did not succeed to join the responsibility.
The cost is not obligated
The OIT building was not only the NFÜ but the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a feast of Noël, organized a ballet at the opportunity of the Holy Luca, on 7 December.
The OIT didn't pay them the use of its salts.
This ball counted five hundred people.
The feast started by the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance on living music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Wednesday treatment was not of all obligations to this ball.
Health, work and local collection ministers prevent a party over.
The Health Ministry will organize a spectacle and party to his employees in its walls for 400 000 forensics.
In contrast, Monika Lamperth, Ministry of Working, does not invite his collaborators officially to a celebration of Noël but to a meeting of the end of year.

Gordon Banai, Minister of Local Collections, will only invite his collaborators to take a wheel in the office of the Ministry of Local Collections and the territory amendment.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organise a Noël's feast in his large room where 436 employees are expected.
It accounts 2 500 forensics by invitation to understand a buffet and a egg.
From the arrival of Janos Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Noël each year of the same way.
The official character is not only strengthened by the minister's exhibition, but also by the time of the celebration at the next day.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organise a receipt on 20 January to celebrate the new year, Noël's feast will not be placed.
The receipt will be held at the Vajdahunyad Chamber, located in the City Boss, and according to the communication of the Ministry, 1 000 formers by person are calculated for hundreds of invitations.
According to the pressure service, this will be a very simple cocktail in which only foreign diplomates in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are taken by some words of welcome from the Security Ministry of a modest food.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture does not make party for Noël, have communicated respective pressure services.
The Press Service of the Ministry of Environment did not know the price of the Official Food.
However, more than four hundred persons were invited to the party organized in the Musée of the Decorative Art.
The forces of the ship are gathering
The Syndicates of the Ligue and the National Association of Worker Councils will, on Friday, constitute their greeting committee that will be carried out to coordinate the undefined period of lunch.
Saturday, a general assembly of Protestation will be held and lunch, the final vote day on the Health Act will start.
This action will certainly cause important bowls in the circulation because the ferry traffic will be held at least totally and the BKV salaries (common transport society) will also be low to 13h.
The Library Syndicates will make known, after-midnight, the details of their lunch green, organized with the National Association of Working Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ commission will also be established, and it will serve a coordinator of lunch actions.
Saturday, a general assembly of Protestation will be held and, from the lunch, the organizations associating with the Great will stop the work for an undefined period if they do not find a agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the grape, from the day of vote to Parliament on the Health Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not apply the law on health boxes, syndicates will immediately remove the call to the grieve.
However, if the law is voted, the green committees will be gathered together and will decide to take it later.
According to the agenda of the Monday of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health cases was not only at night, seeing the night.
Since the egg for lunch, important bowns are provided in the circulation: the ferry paths will stop the work for an undefined period and during the morning a part of the common transport in Budapest and more than half Volan society risks to be arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the path will be blocked.
Many civil syndicates and organizations have been joined to the grive, the list of these is still updated on the Ligue website.
Some organizations are signed to make the gravity for an undefined period, others have declared a temporary work stop.
Before the Judiu after-midnight the MÁV (Hongrois) and the Free Syndicat of Roads (VDSZZZ) have not succeeded to find a agreement on the minimum services, or, at the approach of Noël's feasts, more than many are those who take the train.
According to the current communications, the common transports of Budapest will make severe from the start of service until 13h, the Budapest airport between 7 and 9th of the morning, the industrial syndicates of electricity and the thermical energy of Ligue will make a range of four hours, the writers Syndicate and the Democratic Syndicate of Professors have called to make respectively amount for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Association of Medicines will increase in all countries in different ways, the Syndicate of Health and Social Sektor (EDDSZ) will make a warning twice in the SZEF.
The most important of the four revendications made by the Ligue requires the Government to remove its proposal on health reform and make a new concept in the social debate.
The second income requires that the new method of calculation of the retraite to place from the next year is introduced in several steps.
The third investment wants a guarantee, in relation to the department before the legal age, which would allow the functions that measure it before 2010.
The fourth reason of the action is the rejected by the Free Road Syndicat (VDSZZZ), addressed to the Ligue Syndicats, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economic and Transport on secondary ferroviary lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysing Division (Risk Analysing Division), the activities of the Hungarian Garde, established last August, with support of Jobbik Hungary for Mozgholm (Movie for a better Hungary), increased, under several aspects, the policy risk of Hungary and region.
In its “risk warning”, the company signals that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that“ in short terms of agressive ethnic agressive attacks can result in the aggravation of the ethnic tension already existing between the Chinese and not Chinese population. ”
The research institution added that the Hungria's Political Strategic Strategy, in fact, is the main reason for this situation.
As they say, it is explained by one of the main launchs of Hungarian political actors: “The public actors have passed the public debate on Rome's affairs to representatives of racial and extreme political regulations based on a political strategy on the difference between the Chinese and the Hungarians.”
The problem is aggressive, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists seem to be strengthened and the arrival of agressive conflicts is most likely to say.
However, according to the research institution, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Garden " has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary to the foreign, in particular on confidence in the stability and democracy of the country."
They recall that, after a larger publicity given to the reorganisation of the Hong Kong Radial and Extreme Rights Groups since August 2006, many associations have been constituted in Hungary since 2007, the name of the “National Autodefence Association”.
"The common Treaty of these meetings is that they are defined as a civil organization when they published the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, national defence of the order), armed if it is necessary, exceeding the inaptitude of the police, of the army, otherwise said of the state," they added.
They reported that everything was followed by the method that, based on the political society and parties, seeks to decline various political ambitions under a civil aspect.
Therefore, the accent set on the civil character and the association status is not only served only for the legal parts of the registration of these associations to the court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hong Kong is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to the neighborhood relations.
“In the past months, many neighbour countries are censused by the Hong Kong as a potential risk source and overnationalistic political actors of some limitrophe countries want to justify their anti-honogrance policy in reference to the constitution of the Hong Kong.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institution, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Europe, the political risks have increased all the region.
As they say, the function of the Hungarian Guard seems to, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Garden which the constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
Many problems in Roms who have blown in a room of Sofia (Kraskan Poljana) are in the origin of the construction of Bulgarian guard.
With regard to these events, the UNDP decided to be a guardian, saying that the objective of the organization is “national autodefence”.
According to them, these 17 years recently, the chickens have “terrorized ” Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, remembers the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had been subject to debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of certain Bulgarian Roman organizations on the constitution of their own maintenance in resistance guidelines signals the increase of the risk of ethnic attacks.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Romans react to the threat of the same way by organizing their own self-defence, may be read in the advertising of the political capital risk.
Attila Juhás, research director of Political Capital, said, the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institution.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events were made that could have an impact on risk change, they report public opinion, as in this case, publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red partout
In Hungary, the Law defines exactly the feast days and, around the feasts, it became currently reorganized the working days which the number will reduce the next year.
The feasts are no more uniform in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation separates the national and state feasts and the rest of the days.
Relax days are often linked to religious feasts or important history events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also resting days, this is more so that the revolutioners may be quiet.
Furthermore, in one year, we have the eleven feasts marked in red.
On March 15 is a national party, in memory of the revolution of 1848, as also on 23 October, which is the memorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, the first May is the party of the work and the first and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and our decisive friends.
Furthermore, we have two days in the Passover, the Pentecost and the Noël.
The days of our state, national or religious feasts were struggle on a weekend, according to the calendar, it became currently reorganizing the working days in cases, or there was only a working day before or after the feast marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of long weekend working or going to school the previous weekend.
Since long years, the Ministry of Working is set in a special regulation on the previous or following party's replacement days.
The Law is extraordinary for all employees and for all their employees, on officers and on people working in public service.
However, it is not appropriate for services companys, institutions who turn without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also for the rest of days.
This year, the work days will be changed only on the end of the year: since 24 December, the life is almost stopped in all the country because, according to experiences, most people do more than more hours or take vacation that they have economized to be able to pass between the Sunday and the day of the new year in their house.
The next year many feasts fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be less changes at the level of work days in relation to this year.
The calendar will be first organized around the work party to allow salaries to stay with them four days of applause.
The Saturday 25 April will be a work day to have a day of rest on Friday 2 May.
Another amendment is provided for October 23: Saturday 18 October will be a work day replaced on Friday 24.
In the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the feasts since from 24 December, everyone will make a break even if the day of the new year falls on a Mercedes.
Six football things that can be built terrified in college
E-mails we forget to send, vocabulary messages we never receive, innocent lying who act at us almost more: these are things that “build up ” the day of a workplace.
The question is to know whether we live in these challenges or reach the deficit, and the ambiguous situations are consciously disappeared by disagreements to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that we called you from the marketing service," said a colleague.
What did you give you a taste?
It's best sorry and trying to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (it's the most current solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have several explanations, it is easy to think how you can cause disgraced moments to your colleagues and make efforts to lose them.
Do you use something that doesn't belong to you?
There is nothing more energy than you want to take a document, a officer, or the phone, and you find no part.
Remember that you put the board on the office, but she's lost next morning?
You found your style that you thought you lost on your college's office?
Don't take anything to your colleagues without ask if they're right to get hurt against you that they've got their goodness.
Don't get back of mails, from posting it in your box because it can be embarrassing that there is no more and that you need it all right now.
You're the private life of colleges?
There are no good ways to stop pools who propagate.
Who did that with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your private life of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't disappear his trust!
Enter the information shared and don't discuss with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also at the current.
You're gonna tell you sick without just motive?
When you call the office and tell you disease under the pretext of a bad head, because you feel bad or you like to have a need of relax this day, think that your work, your urgent business, your term missions must be done by someone else on your place.
Don't worry about your colleagues!
If you know the presence that you're not going to work on the next day or that something can happen to you who would have to stay with you, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues to deny that they're surprising your absence next day.
Freedom, Restaurant, phone
You're taking up in your job, but your colleagues' reaching you brutally?
You've been, without you want to, a witness of a phone discussion that you'd better do not listen?
Don't decline your colleagues with freundings, songs, speaking with a lot of voice (which you bring above their head), feet battements, big words or distractions expressed in high voice.
They can delay even if your colleagues do not be broken in a project (redaction, conception, organization).
Do you accuse others for a fault?
If your job is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send a mail or an important message, don't accuse anyone for this forget!
Don't put it on the account of the accidental chaos in the office or your bruying college!
Remember him if you made a mistake, and if this has shown unconvenients for others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you could make your mistake, repair the negligence!
Do you feel too much at your office?
Play a playing and chaos is comfortable to the house, but they don't agree to the office!
Don't make comfortable playing even if your function allows it!
Don't be negligent, respect your colleagues and yourself in the right hand, and if your function is required by putting joy and elegant clothes, to go work!
If you want to answer the agents, you're not interesting.
We're getting low in the normal bown of the morning.
At least, a particular melody is to hear the radio: the voice of a violon to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm getting the sound.
The music changes of ritm and the low is coming to achieve the tons all the time, then a woman's crown comes into it as a real beau.
Mr2 divorced the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not guaranteed us for long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Well, now it seems that the bouchon becomes different if you listen to the new album of Zagar.
The apparence of Yonderboi, some new interesting products of the Hungarian digital subground begins shortly to change the total image and, instead of the new mode of the garage rock declaring the guitar, the Hungarian electropope proves that there is a new under the sun.
Balass Züger came from Pecs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before he starts on his own way, perhaps because 'No place for two feet in the same chaussure'.
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz-alliance, an electronic and pop music danced, began to be known when it was confident of the composition of filmed sound tracks (e.g.
The saison of Ferenc Turk.
The training at the beginning of small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the wan2 magazine cited their first album in 2002 among the fifty major dischets of the Hungarian market and preached Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost only creators of the Hungarian trends that would also be competent in the west.
Zagar and his together became unconcentrablely "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to take this label.
The group reacted as needed, he went out a new and better disc.
The album intitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, out recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years past in Pecs.
It was that it was a line of the old group of Pecs of Balass Zöder.
We are well with the reference to the air but near the air music now appears after the spirit and the tendency of the time, the strongest guitar, the impact of Rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a song currently working in England with the The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs at the first of the album in the Miller Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, diversing from a little popular music in the morning evening, began to introduce the Wings of Love melodies recorded with six Hong Kongs ("Underground Divas").
So it's okay (?).
hvg.hh has issues on Balass Zöker.
hvg.hu: This new tube takes me to ask a question: is that your music has been well staying a music that looks for a certain bed?
Zürer Balazs: The music term that looks for a certain bed doesn't tell me a big thing.
For me there are two casts in the light music; not manstream or underground, not alternative or popular but commercial music and true music.
Musicals say alternative, underground can also be middle and do only to sell them and become commercially.
But a good pop song can also be serious.
The attitude of receipt also works in this spirit independently from language or frontiers.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and stranger public, is that one or another is more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In the foreign, especially on the west, the lower music has more old traditions.
The people go to concerts and not only the young men of a decade or twenty years but also the elderly.
They follow more attention to the changes in the light music because they think it is also part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of public in your work?
Are you interested to know who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm sure happy to see that people come more in our concerts.
However, we never did music for the market.
The music is not made for us to achieve a target but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence is already working, but it is not only considered in the immediate changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to answer the public attorneys, you're not more interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you have your account to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made a carrier at the west.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his way even if sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let us develop.
In the beginning, it was well inevitable that our music was compared to Yonderboi because we are many to leave his group and to take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palmaris of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love works the first place.
Many are those who have heard the name of Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this most popular style, have you opened consciously to a larger layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have to make a tube to save the disk.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to adhere the organ of sounds and the most difficult themes at all the disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a bottle of the genre gospel.
We had the idea to compose this roll of good solists of the Hungarian musical scene.
So the carrier was made to six members, to know Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was baptized then underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Do you want this song like this or the girls have changed it a little?
Zs.B.: This song has already existed in a instrumental version, and then when we composed the album, we thought he was missing something in this song.
The following agreements attacked the song's voice.
I was singing even the melodie that girls learned later.
I almost had it, and everything was terrified.
I remember that this has gained me in the time, but we are sure we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disk and the concert, I also seemed that girls were behind.
There is no sol (except a single short of Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they sing together and they can't sing stronger than music, so music does not just accompany their songs.
They were behind the scene too.
Is that what I wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind is only to technical problems.
In contrast, what was voluntary is that we didn't want to distribute soil roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a bit of our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we need to just leave these ailes, the fields of love, bring us.
I wanted others to feel this efficient state that we felt when the song is born.
hvg.hu: What songs did you work?
Zs.B.: In fact, nothing about the musical creation process, we had more difficult tracks in the medium.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert plan, or with Rock'n'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little, everything has been placed as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite for the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "lifted" this disc.
In this time, these are the prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The training is perfid to risk billions because of its complexity of minority
A dissimulator frauder.
Thus, his old employer designs the general society, owner of the Chec Bank of Commercial Bank.
The bank lost for him about five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel is not only a great player who wanted to equate his colleagues, and that, in addition, can not be considered as impossible.
In contrast to all the large bank houses, he recognized the crisis of the American hypothesis market.
"He's fragile," they left his superiors who denied him to the police.
However, if it is at the deposition of Kerviel reported by the French media, including the World, the transactions of this man in the last year have produced a beneficiary of 1,6 billion euros.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to win money for my bank," he said in the deposit.
The last age, he succeeded to benefit the American crisis to win a half billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
In February, the information started to take place in which the hypothecs said "sub-price" were given to low income clients or well to those who had met in the past of the refund difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did well.
So, at the end of the year, its benefits were 1,6 billion euros.
"When I win my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," she trusted Kerviel, and adds that he has no, well hearing, nothing saved for himself."
In all the intergovernmental, he suggested that he failed the reports to not be described.
He succeeded to suffer its superiors, although the Eurex bourse began to interest in its transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything
Didn't he find out?
It's not.
"I liked that the simple fact that I had obtained 1,6 billion for the bank would be satisfied."
Where's his desire to risk so big?
It was just progressively made to his position.
He started working in the General Society in 2000 just after he had finished his studies in Lyon University.
His annual salary turned around 51,000 dollars.
Two years later, he was already assisting to travel and in 2005, he became undependent with an annual payment of $90,000.
But he knew he would never win as much as others.
"After my first training in 2005, I knew that I was very less considered than others.
In view of my colleagues and my professional and personal parks, Kerviel investigators described.
But, shortly after his entering in function, he brings his first great success.
According to Allianz actions, he won a half billion euro by putting down this title in London's attention.
And the mechanism was declined — he wanted more.
While you won, we'll leave you in peace
"It's like a snow ball," he said to the police.
But the tops were at the end of all, or at least, they had to do it.
"Before I won, they were like to close the eyes."
But it's when the start of the year's beginning happens.
He lost a billion of euros in a day.
In the middle of January, after weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he arrives to work, he is no longer employed from the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that she lost 5 billion euros for him.
And how did we find it?
He was suspected because of his conges.
"The year past, I just took four days of congestion.
A trader that doesn't take vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," conclude Kerviel.
Czech for the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government have signed in any nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the future years, bring 14 billion euros (before 365 billion of the Czech Republic) to the Czech Republic.
It is nearly about half the totality of the Czech Czech may get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
For 125 billion core issues of seven operating programmes will be destined to the Czech regions.
Chess enterprises can get about 100 billion core in the framework of the Company and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest part, to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents to 22% of the financial measures that the Republic of Chess can get in the framework of these projects.
This money will be in the origin of a highest budget of the National Fund of the Transport Infrastructure that will handle a sum of 90,8 billion corones in the next year.
The Company and Innovation Programme, destined to the PME and Employers, should be used to get financial means to encouraging innovation within the company.
The companies should have financial means to introduce new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective management methods.
Finally, the Chec Republic was part of the new members of the EU's funds the less successful benefits.
The Court confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the President of Nicaragua
The Criminal Court of Nicaragua confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the elder president of Arnold German country, which was condemned in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (by approximately 1,8 billion core).
But later, he was released and lived in residence in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the old officer of this Centre-American, according to 1997 and 2002, will be or not again incarcered, after the AP Agency, not clearly.
According to the President of the Court of Appearance Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or if they will leave German to finish his pain in his house or go again into prison.
4 years ago, the Court proved that the Germany regularly moved the money of the Government to foreign society accounts in Panama.
It was fixed society and accounts were real to members of his family and the nearest parties.
A part of this money is gone into the funds which Aleman had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
We adopted the budget
That's it.
The statistical budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this Government and accepted by the government's majority without support of the opposition.
This year has been a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - CHSSD, since it was the Ministry of Sobotka who had prepared it and CSSD could not be allowed to reject it.
In contrast to the Agency Debates before the vote of the defence declaration to the Government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Deputy Chamber adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influenced, is usually negative.
That's a sort of paradox.
Let each chapter and every article be the beginning and the end of all government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, although it has been hidden behind the competition of government and opposition.
This last is more medically attractive, and it is that it gives him more attention in the media.
The debates of political men are more interested in the opinion of the numbers broken.
The national budgets of the past social governments have suffered three badly that the current budget is not approved to regulate once:
The first is the important part of the mandates imposed by the law, constituted not only by the retraits, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the CSSD and KSCHM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, the consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he is constituted by the deficit of public finances, is to say by the deficit of cities and communities.
However, it is not the deficit of the statistical budget that represents the greatest alone.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real bomb is the deficit of the cities and communities.
Many rooms were often exceeding obligations to decrease their municipalities, in order to obtain the money of impositions, fishing rights and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they succeeded to rebuild these costs by the sale of distribution systems, including those of the energy, obtained from the State in the framework of privacy.
Today, they don't have any more of this source.
If it is only at the official and checkable facts, it is stated that:
Our economy has already passed through a few years, even as the rest of the world, a growth phase and the CSSD is not missing to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successful governments of this part to regulate public finances.
But instead of that, they were increasingly attached to the State.
In other countries, made some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, handled their business in a greater reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a monstruous honour that is essentially threatened on the previous governments.
We are part of countries who, at the global scale, are at least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need of massive social programmes that are just these last years, unfortunately infected.
Although it has been successful to remove a part of the absurd population expenditure, approved the year before the elections, if a decline of the age limit for retrait, and a reform of the retrait system will not be closely placed, then every policy will stop existing in this country and whoever will be in power will only be administrated.
By exagering, it may be said that political men in power will become officers that mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between retraits and social prestations.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes the normal costs to be replaced by the mandate costs.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely inutile if the previous governments had not disposed all the money they could.
If we really don't want that the policies of power become simply bureaucrates, we must be patients and give this fragile government coalition, knowing that the State cannot depend only the equation of what happens to prevent in imposes and fiscal rights, the calm for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only these lasts that will make progressively a balanced statistical budget.

Banks want to set the crisis
The Federal American Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Switzerland and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together the crisis of financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will be placed on the monetary markets by the intermediary.
It will be done for banks to sell, by an energy system, the interests in which they are ready to buy money.
For example, the United States Fed will send over 40 billion dollars and will also provide 24 billion to the European Central and Switzerland Banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to act at this concerted point, in order to prevent, to reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This start is to fix the major problems of economic, to know the growing missing free capitals that banks could offer," wrote in his report to the Bernard Baumohl clients of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The Concerted Action of Central Banks has reduced the probability of a recession to the United States of 65 per cent at about 50 per cent," adds Baumohl to his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of unrecommended prices, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other billion losses.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this attempt, it is that they must really appreciate what can still happen," said the Economic of Amro Kieran Davies, leader of the ABN.
"He seems that the situation is really bad," adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have a difficult access to the price, they will offer more favorite to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and throw America's economy into a recession that could influence the economic growth of the whole world.
The Central Banks have made this choice after that it was not achieved to low down London's interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to build on the interbanc market.
This means that the banks were always afraid of mutual emphasis, although the Central Banks of America, Canada and English were reduced in several times during the top, their interests.
"This will have the same effect that a new low-down of interests," said the Agent Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analyticals don't believe that the start of central banks will not contribute to conjugate the crisis because it doesn't regulate the main problem that is the crash of immobilier market in the United States.
President Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes are calculated in particular to developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus has renewed the problem of the planetary refrigeration.
The crisis has been attacked this time on the International Conference of the United Nations on climate changes finished in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, suggested that the discussions of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a curious measure of non-governmental representatives and non-governmental organizations, which is inacceptable, but also the basic differences between the rhetoric and the reality.
"The debate is not structured of everything, it is only a phrase of words, replacement of solutions to current problems," says Klaus.
The Chairman of the Czech President sublined, when his book presented, that his subject has a great importance for him, and that is why he is so angry for that reason.
He also showed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, because he said, "I'm often meet only the caricature of my opinions."
Then, interested persons can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus reminded that, although he was not climateology, he, however, had enough provisions to edit such a book.
In fact, it is a able to follow and appreciate scientific treatments, he has the practice of statistics and is also economic.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following threats: the climate developed without stop, the changes of this are normal, there are no opinion shared by all researchers on planet reaching, the effects of current changes are not too important or too serious, therefore they represent no danger, and, finally, the efforts for the impact of climate are inutile, ineffective and inacceptablely costable.
Moreover, with the experience of a totalitarian regime, it is considered inacceptable to imitate the opinions invested to others, which feels like a dangerous approach to freedom.
In response to the issues of the present persons, he explained several times that it was not a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integral environmentalism that does not consider the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring.
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this issue two months ago, in the Hayek Institute.
600000 people have not succeeded to renew their permission to lead in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have left the period and have not succeeded to renew their old permissions to drive where validity is expired at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask the renew, so that the authorities are in order to deliver them a new permission before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers have no valid permission to carry out the route.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permission to lead in particular those who have no longer wanted to drive.
While the communities sign a delay of the number of requests of renewed permissions, the authorities in the capital are disappeared by requests and the number of requests for renewing the permission is gone through this week.
Mairia satisfied about 2000 clients per day.
There's a cup of a half-hour nearly.
In Prague, near 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their permissions to drive.
The release of a new permission takes 20 days.
But it is possible to ask freedom in a short time of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a five hundred corner supply.
The vehicle drivers that will not succeed to implement the renewable rehabilitation of the permission to lead from here the end of the year, and we will undertake the route without a valid permission, will risk, since January, an amendment.
The crime will be contrary to pay two thousand corners to maximum.
However, the police can also treat the infraction with a friendly delay.
In the case of a administrative infraction, the driving drift to 2500 corners.
According to ancient information, it was subject to an amendment even a person who would not circulate.
This could be contrary to pay to 30,000 corners.
The Ministry had called the authorities to moderation and to impose amendments that are not over 1000 corners.
However, according to the door-word of the Ministry of Transports Karel Hanzelka, no one risks for ten thousands of changes.
The permission to conduct is, according to him, a document which people can decide if they want or not to have it.
It's not like the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
People who don't want to drive any more should re-live their permissions to drive.
It is enough to bring or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The permissions to be released between 1964 and 1993 will stop being valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also committed to renew progressively from other types of driving.
People have documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years to renew the renew.
The validity of delivered drivers in 2001 to 2004 exceeds in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2,6 million other documents.
The Court decreed the penalties of patent detectives with Berdich
Josef Opava and Peter Koňarzyk, ancient cops accused of conviction with David Berdich's gang, will make respectively thirty and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has condemned them definitively by reducing their penalty respectively of 1 years and 2 years.
In the original, the Detectives of the Department for the fight against the organizated crime risks of 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is not more possible to call against the judge today, only one call to the Supreme Court is considerable.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is not waiting for now only the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received other penalties processes that the summary is over 16 years of prison.
He can't receive more.
In January, the Department Court recognised crimes for participation in 19 persons, the Supreme Court treated today the call interjections of 16 of them.
The majority of the inculcates received, from the beginning of the investigation, in question, the accusation confirming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Court of Justice of Central Bohemma, the police members, after a agreement between Berdich, transmitted to criminals of police sources, covered the various holdup and helped the members of the gang to disappear the criminal responsibility.
The gang rejected 30% of the larcin in Opava and Koňarzyk.
In the accusation, it is concerned about the criminal activities of the gang in 1999 to 2001.
Existently, army flows which, in most cases, victims have been a serious approach to health, but also the abus of power of a public agent and army has been prohibited.
In the home investigations, the police has actually discovered illegally arrested guns, buss with an asshole, a viewer for the direct laser or a mixer.
According to the accusations, the gang has reached decades of millions of coroners.
The courts have already recognized crimes of other ships in the hand of Berdych and all a series of other people.
Other men of Berdich neighborhood are still trying to explain before the Court in another case, some cases have not yet arrived until the court.
The main audience, for the time, has been absent, Tomas Pöta and Maroš Schulj, who live currently in prison in Ireland, where they expect the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
The family lawyer Igor Veleba wants to get from the hospital of Trübič a democracy of 12 million coroners more expenditures.
Three million for each mother, two million for parents and one million for each children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondrej Dostál is not absolutely agreed with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such revenge, this is very high," said Dostal at the outcome of the audience.
"In order to make a opinion on the contrary proposal, we need the report of experts which the adverse party has ordered the reaction.
We're going to check if this is a clear value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not be over hundreds of thousands," sublined Dostál.
The amount should, after him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloñov's family asked a million coroners for each month where she could not exalte her biological daughter.
Veleba was served by the expert report, published for him by the university hospital center in Prague-Moton, as a document on support for democracy negotiations.
According to psychological experts and psychiatrics, parents have made a psychological pain and were subject to the stress of various scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were confronted to the reasons that they would not stop the replacement of new-years.
Women, they remain less serious before the life of the traumatism in the present and before what is exactly happening at this time, raised the content of Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by sisters to the hospital of Tribycz last 9 December.
The past week, the children were returned to their biological parents - Nikola in the Chermak in the Adventure and Veronika in Libor Brosch and Jaroslava Trojana to Jabloňov.
The Governor of the Region Wysočina Miloš Vystreshed and remised, at the end of October, at each of the 100,000 council families for the rebuilding of the expenses occurred by the error of the hospital of Trzebič led by the region.
All hospitals in Czech are confronted by the law to ensure civil responsibility.
In the case of missing, they must be put into the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager's assistance.
Finally, the courts recognised relatively not highly deducts, the following tables were calculated from the order of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Milk and loss of the Valash Kingdom (in Royaume de Valašska)
Boek Polívka and I lose the living on the marque of the Valash Kingdom (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the Court of the Regional Court of Ostrava, he was actually used for the first time by the King of Valašsko, but the project was made on foot by the team around Thomas Harabiš, an old collaborator of the actor.
Polivka wasn't present today's audience.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will call.
"The ligue is about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitized on the popularity of Boek Polívka," said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
According to him, the Kingdom of Valašsko says to everyone just this and comic.
Harabish is the same opinion.
"There's a work behind us about ten years.
He said, "The search of money and the implementation of events."
Following him, it's the money that's the cause of the bed.
"After years, they have been considered that the project has successful and that they could benefit.
They are those who want to parasite our work," he added.
A luxury business
According to the Court, Polívka used for the first time the Balshian King (Rei de Valašsko) in his television emission.
Actor Radoslave Brzobohatti had a coronary king in 1993.
However, at the time, it wasn't reported with the project to put a fixed kingdom on foot.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of showing passports of the Valash Kingdom.
A humanitarian action to the origin has come out a business and a lucrative trade activities, followed by Harabiš, of the Valash Kingdom society.
In 1997, Polívka accepted his name and signature to be citated in the passport and also proposed to the officers of soldiers on the price of the visit of his chair and theatre.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš just used the new idea, published by Polívka in the manufacturer emission, to commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka and certainly helped the Valash Kingdom project," said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabiš and her team that would be raised to the project intensely.
Today, the cooperation between the parts of the enemies continued until 2000 when Harabish organized for Polívka a official core in Vsetin.
But from there, conflicts began to condemn themselves between Polívka and Harabiš, which have colmonized with the deposition "the King Boleslav 1er elected forever."
The role that leads in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, subjected by the song Jarmila Schulková as the mother.
Following, in 2002, Polívka was convinced against Harabish and his society, requested the court to reject today.
What could be able to shoot the case is the turned for the throne and half of the princess.
He should go out of a new king.
He didn't want to track the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go quickly.
It would be something like the defiled kings in Slovacko.
The king would be chosen for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka may be clearly insert," added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: loss of prejudice
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
His rolling qualities were no extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, the conduct, and also the manufacturer could be qualified as far as the average.
But now there's his successor on the market, Peugeot 207, which, she, is very better.
As more than the SW named is still a longer step, it's not more than thinking better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I liked, for example, the space for the head on the behind seats.
As you finish the plains, because the carcery means that even the great devils will, in this regard, beyond the ice.
Let's see quickly.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly to not too much to repeat me.
It's a little closely successful design, my only note that brings on the central tunnel that appears to me poor.
There, I would love a little more inventive design, because the car looks like elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and the time we could be discovered with seats or folders too short is revolutioned.
The side guide also improved in relation to model 206.
In relation to the space, the increase of the dimensions of the cartridge is also sensitive.
It also sees the missing of place above the head already mentioned.
A coffee in the coffee
The most important on this vehicle, so it's his bathroom support.
I have to assess this as a very well accessible (equivalently by the pivotant glass behind) and a more easier arrimage.
The airspaces are municipal of arrest plots that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not combined and can be expanded, while it is possible to have enough hard objects.
But let's stop the volume.
This is, according to the tables, 428 l in the base configuration, which is in relation to competition a more average number.
In the part of Schkoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech.
If it is compared to the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, it is considered that Peugeot remains very sensitively behind, the differences of 52 liter.
When it is going to be congested to the foreign or well to load a puzzle, this number is almost critical.
But if I had to do the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the reversation of the items of the seats in perfectly right, or well a very low market.
120 horses distributed on four cilindros
The car that we tested was equipped by a Otto engine of four cilindros with a volume of 1,6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, it's that it should look like a 1,6 who makes a hachback family.
He's silent, smoking a little, and, especially, he puts well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Schkoda, which often gives the impression of having a exploitation pool rolled by a serpent, then I can't be only an inhusyist.
Let's see the targets
The price of the vehicle is not attractive for all.
However, we must have aware that we have tested a very equipped car with a very spaceless and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a Otto 1,4 litres higher than 329 900 Kč is still passible.
The vehicle we tested from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increased the price of 80 000 Kč.
But we had more aircraft heads, automatic climatement, automatic slides, automatic commands of the windows behind...
In fact, the vehicle costs on 531 900 Kč account.
It's a lot, but try to add to Fabia's price the additional equipment and you will get a very similar number.
So it's not more than selecting the mark.
The integration of Slovak schools in the British schools is bad
The number of original children from the countries of Eastern Europe in the British schools will grow, which causes the residents of concerns on the development of local education.
The integration of the East Europeans is now in a series of obstacles.
The British schools are even in cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the origin residents are transformed in violence.
The case of the North Kent, where the opposite conflicts and immigrants of the Slovak origin, are very clear to the problem of integration of the original children of East Europe.
The discussions, the chican and the bagary between students have been transmitted in relations between parents.
The situation was departed so far that the police had stopped a Slovak woman in Chatham, who struck a 10-year-old age bar.
The criminal defenses that the boy insulted him by racist proposals.
The police also had to intervene in the attack against a Slovak immigrant carried out by two adolescents.
The young girls were immediately addressed to this man of racistic notes and threw him stones.
"When we were going home, a young man cried on the bus stop and began to break up on us.
When I told him to stop, he replied by pomes and pools, and then he discovered his feet," another disappointable adventure described a mother of Slovak elevens.
Closures are formulated by both parties.
One of the residents has gone to qualify conflicts with the immigrants for the survival.
The higher cases are witnessing that the atmosphere in the British schools between the origin and the immigrants begins to be trended.
70 000 Slovakiens came to find work are recorded in the Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovakian students fresh the British schools.
Cuba, the Best Caribbean Islands
For visitors, it's really a island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your conges can happen if you make a good choice.
Dark and white grounds such as snow, high vagues, or then a calm sea as a steel.
Palms and all included with servers offering you a pizza, ice, or well of cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea Islands, you will not only find this list in its integrity, but strictly.
But there's only one island on which you'll find more, and it's Cuba, the greatest and beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During the Spanish, Cuba was the base of their invasion in America.
Christophe Colomb qualified it as the best place that human eye has never seen.
Havana became the deposit and the place of translation of the Tresors that the Spanish had fled and transported to Europe.
Then the U.S.'s coming.
The National Hotel has been exhausted at the beginning of the 20s.
It's Lucy Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime in the United States (in the field of prohibition) was adopted and supported in Cuba: drugs, hazard games, prostitution.
Some of his clients, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, highly built buildings and cars, apparent to the cult symbols of the 50th century, moved on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway buyed a property in San Francisco of Paula, near the Havana, and in Cojemar, he had his eight.
The stars of the business show and political men in the whole America lay their signatures on the walls of the Medium Bodeguita.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of the Havane.
In the bar of the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars are always running to Havana, because the jigolis and the imported jadis fish has already been in a climate so sad and humble, perri.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is sensitively decreed, there is no other part in the areas there is no longer great colonial monuments that there is exactly there.
Other places become beautiful, for example, Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green fire.
During the past 15 years, new hotels were not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, at the front of the village of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba proposes another fantasy that is unique in the world and which will be appreciated especially by the amateurs of small trains.
The canne was rent from the plants extended in sucres on a street route by small vapeur and engine trains.
Their ruling material has not been renewed for decades of years, and it is so that it can be seen in the way of small locations which contemporary are not only in museums.
Where's going to drive his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most known locations.
So we don't need to write it long on Varadero or well on Havane.
If you remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not raise the visit.
The Valley of Viňales at the west of the island is one of the most pittorical corners of Cuba.
A exuberant vegetation and puts on a calcaire ground.
Mogotes, calculer ballons and rocks mount to the ground of the valley, and, from the fertilized ground in their rings, even its potent rocks are covered from a very deep virtual board.
The valley is the place where it probably is cultivated the cuban tabac of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havanese cigarettes.
Someone may also find interesting that it is where the chili episode of Major Zeman was turned.
Trinidad
Ancient cities founded a little time after Spanish colonized the island.
It is the market of the slaves and the sugar that brought him glory and riches.
The riches were incarnated in the beauty and the city-widget character of this reduced city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, highly affected by later French attendants, has not been changed at least for four hundreds.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the massive Scambray mountains, is a place at the same time that is still in the 50th century, there was no way to reach this region with the rest of the country.
This isolally allowed him to stay on the side.
We were not built anything, and that's why we didn't demoly anything, everybody was happy to have a tooth above the head.
If we have, in Trinidad, more time than a afternoon, then it's the worst to go to see also interesting places in the areas, such as Playa Ancon, or the Valley of Sucreries.
Then, evening, it's comfortable to go to the Music House who's animated after the sun's bed and where music is just at the morning.
Baracoa
Some design this bourgate located at the East Extrême of Cuba as the best of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that goes there.
The two routes from Guantánamo have to prevent high and accidented mountains and travel nearly without marks of human activities.
UNESCO wrote the East East of Cuba, by its intact landscape, on the list of the world patrimoine.
There is the best chocolate, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in reality, she saw the day at nearly hundred years after Columbus) and from the colline where the old chateau-fort and the current hotel El Castillo is seen several tables, which is the most honourable Yeast.
With regard to the coffee, the rum, the cigarettes, the massage of the mountain Sierra Maestra, the Baia of the trials and the island of Pinos, the island of Tropicana, the sanctuary of the Holy Patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the old slaves, on all of this, can be fulfilled a number of pages.
Just as we say just, it's better to see one time.
In Afghanistan, the alities are passive, especially the Americans
The missing of soldiers and equipment required affects, according to the United States, on the deployment of the mission in Afghanistan.
Following the Ministry of Defence Robert Gates, the OTAN should take a specific plan for the future years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not deployed as it should, and the representatives of the countries in the southern part of the country have agreed with Edinburgh.
Near the growing contempt of the Taliban movement, the eight involving States discuss today also future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States called this week by the Ministry of Defence Robert Gates the OTAN teams to a larger activities, the Great Britain sees priority to strengthen the Afghanistan Government authority and the intensification of support to development.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is understandable, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
The other is to allow inhabitants to start a new development of economic and security," the BBC chapter said the Minister of the British Defence of De Browne.
Four-fifty per cent
The activities of African insurgents is, according to the data of the American Army, the most intense of these five years.
The number of violent actions increased 27 per cent in relation to the past year, to 60 per cent in Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
The OTAN countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, including nearly a quarter in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the aliances have reached their absolute limits and the organization and the equipment of groups.
In particular, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the aggressive groups.
"We should consider seriously the specific objectives for the future period, as well as on ways to get them," said Gates.
The Secretary-General of OTAN Jaap de Hoop has today a similar question.
"I am not happy of what we have on earth and air in Afghanistan.
We have nearly 40 per cent of soldiers and the equipment we needed, and it is not enough," said De Hoop to the Reuters at the end of the Japanese government to Tokyo who had three days.
Who is passive
The last months also rules between countries involved conflicts on the question if all associations do effectively in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively useful representation in Afghanistan.
But they are involved in areas where violence is minimum, the requirements of battle which they are concerned are not so rich as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British Sun tabled qualified the German soldiers of parsees this week.
"The famous Afghans discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," wrote Sun in a document completed by the photos of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German journal Image has passed to the contra-attach by publishing the photo of a British team in a rugby match in the southern Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will be a billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of over 84,000 corners in each Czech.
The total debt is mounted, the end of September, at 842,7 billion corones.
The Government was proposed to exceed this year 159.2 billion Koreans.
With regard to the development of the economys of the best State's budget, the Ministry decreased the sum of 152.8 billion core.
The State of the Czech Republic has been mounted to the end of September to 842.7 billion core.
Thus, during the nine months of this year, he increased 40,2 billion core.
Now, since June, he decreed 13,4 billion core.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the debt of the State dating at the beginning of October.
The load of a 84,000 corners are income to each Czech.
During the last year, the State has increased over 111 billion core.
"Today, it seems that, through a less important deficit proposed for the next year, we could overcome the border of a billion core only in 2009.
The next year, the debt should be sitting between 900 billion and a billion core," said Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The prevision of the Next Finance Vladimir Pikor Analysis is similar: "We could overcome the billion at the current year of 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene changed, that the policies were prepared for more economies, the date could be replaced in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
This is growing
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the Central Government and it is essentially funded by the accumulation of the deficits of the State's budget.
The debt of the State is financed by goods of the reserve, payment titles, direct or well companies, for example by investment banks.

The average requirement of the State's debt was higher than 6,5 years.
"The total debt has increased between the first to the third semester of 13 per cent, which is, in consideration of the current economic health, a very high number.
It's interesting that the height is generated especially by the retail tickets where it gets 20 percent.
It is bad that the dawn grows, but on the other hand, this indicates that there will be a matter to negotiate when the reform of retraits will come," commented Picora data.
Better than what we expected
It was concluded of the financial and management strategy of the State's debt for 2007 that the Government had provided over 159,2 billion core in this year.
However, at the beginning of September, the Ministry reduced the sum of 152,8 billion core economy.
The summary is essentially constituted by the deficit of the State's budget, which will obtain 76 billion core in this year in place of 91,3 billion corees.
Then, it is the maximum sources for the Chec Consolidation Agency, to know 13,3 billion corones, the reserve of 10 billion for retraits, the financing of state rates for 43 billion coron and the rebounds of the European Investment Bank of Investment.
She compares today before a court in Khartoum to have named an oxygen
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insult on the islam was condemned by a court of Khartoum at 15 days of prison and expulsion.
The British was accused to have left students of 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mahomet to an oxygen in battle, while all the representation of the prophet of the islam is illegal.
She was passible of a pain of fucking cups.
This British Institutor of 54 years in the Unitedity High School of Khartoum in Sudan has been arrested on Sunday at its house and included expectations to Islam and Section, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanal Criminal Code, following several parliaments of electronic parents in the Ministry of Sudanal Education.
The remote story on September, when this teacher asks his students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the oor in the class.
“There are names out of the mouth of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed”, reports the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children of 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Children then made a book for the class with the photo of the oror followed by the "My name is Mohamed".
Ourselves didn't take any label with this name, but the problem was just the representation of the prophet considered as an insulte to the islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching in the same school in Sudan, declared that he knew it well and that she had never done anything that could be insulting against religious faith, “I just regret that she had asked children to vote for a name”, it is not according to him as a “inocent error”.
Attention shared by many students of the Institutor who describe it as “trough attention to his students” and“the one never speaks of religion in class.”
Remember that the name of Mohamed is also the second name of the first name given in the Great Britain, it is written by English of 14 different ways.
This name often chose by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a game, for example?
It is certainly a question of interpretation.
They have not been married to a agreement on the future state of the provinces during the last meeting of negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, it's missing.
The Serbia and the Albanians of Kosovo have finished a sixth and last meeting of discussions in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future statute of the separate province.
"It is regretable that the parties were not able to be able to be a statute agreement," said the European Mediterranean Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Understanding that peace in the region was “in game”, his American homolog, Frank Wisner, invited Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to keep peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“There is not for violence in the immediate, but we enter into a very difficult period,” he added, relevantly, that “existent tensions exist.”
End of Mediterranean on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which regroup the European Union, the United States and the Russian Union, will be the last day in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the unplexed province at 90% of albanophonies may be clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian Mediterranean Alexander Botsanne-Khartchenko will give their report to the United Nations Security Council from here to 10 December.
The Baden discussions, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiations session since Troyka was carried out of a new medium by the United Nations, last August.
Americans and Europeans agreed that their medicine would be fulfilled on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already been blocked in the Security Council, encourages them to continue negotiations beyond that bottom date.
“Russian was and remained intended for a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of ursian administration of Kosovo, western states that independence under EU monitoring is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it in unilateral ways if the Security Council does not lock in its favor.
Belgrade insists on a increased autonomy.
“No agreement has been found,” announced the President of the self-name authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in Baden's hotel, where these "negocies of the last chance".
Hashim Thaci, ancient commander of the Cosovary Rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the Province, has been part of its records.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “along the past that led to murders and deports”.
‘Domain Effect’
The Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated that a compromise was still invisible, keeping the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral proclaiming of the independence of the provinces.
Belgrade, in particular, refuse a "dominal effect" in a still fragilized region by the independence wars of 1990.
"For Serbia, it does not mean that an compromise is impossible."
Mardi, Serbian delegation had inquired that any decision would return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian coalition has a veto right.
“The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” said the Prime Minister of Serbia, Vojilav Kostunica.
“These negotiations have been two years.
They must end up as they have started: to the Security Council."
At journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the state”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independentness of the albanophonos would be“concertation” with the West.
Bush takes an agreement between Israel and Palestinian
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference, by his married meetings to Annapolis, in Maryland, that the Israelites and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common statement.
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had heard to immediately engage negotiations in order to find a definitive regulation of the delight of 60 years old among their two people.
In the presence of two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a "pay train" before the end of 2008.
At the same time, Palestinians must deny "the terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end up their colonisation activities, said Bush, recalling both parties to their obligations in respect of the "path fire" for the peace they have accepted in 2003.
The officer of the White House submitted that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided by Abbas would show "to conclude a peace Treaty resolving all the issues in suspension, without exception, including the central issues."
This call takes the three difficult problems in the heart of the joyfulness between Israel and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the state of Jerusalem, and the outcome of the Arab refugees cast out of their families in what is today the State of Israel in the conflict of 1948.

For the proof, the police are not responsible.
What's exactly going on tomorrow?
Like every time in this different type of fact, official and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the National Police (IGPN), a police car traveled on Sunday after 17 hours, rue Louise-Michel, at Villiers-le-Bel.
“It was not in intervention but in patrouille, and runs to 40-50 km/h, without stereo,” explains a police source.
A green moto of the Kawazaki mark, “not homologated, so not allowed to circulate on the public path” (lear down) and piloted by two young people without ships, circulated “to very alive going”.
“The police car on his left, after a right priority refused”, a policeman claimed.
The control of alcoholemy practiced on the vehicle's employees has been negative.
The state of the car (founded, stealed park-brises, coup-chocs rolled) witnesses the violence of the choc.
Too fast, yesterday morning, the Procurement of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Terère of Givry, announced that a research for “involutionary murder failures and non-assistance to anyone in danger” to the IGPN, issued with the Department Direction of the Public Security of Val-d'Oise.

Liberation met an ocular witness of those moments who followed the accident.
One of his windows put exactly on the scene.
"We're going down soon, with my coach who's sick in the hospital, to try to rain them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Afterward, he saw “the police entirely hagard, who bought.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young ones, the fourth talked to the phone."
Faced to the tension quickly around the scene, and it seems to be sure that the people have been present in the unexpected situation of young people, the police have been carried out by colleagues arrived on the sites.
The safeguards have arrived “nearly twenty minutes after the department of the police”.
They also practiced heart masses, in vain.

Spectacular reparation on the space station
It will have more than seven hours of work in the astronaut Scott Parazynski and its international Space Station equipment company (ISS) to perform the spectacular reparation of a solitaire panel, essential to continue the scientific activities of the station.
A risked output that accumulated the records of its time, from its apartment of residual modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, tools "broken" by the astronauts to make the reparation.
The problem appeared in March when the astronauts had downloaded from the Discovery nave, the Harmony module, a large cylindric room loaded to accommodate the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see incad).
This module is a sort of packing for laboratory modules.
But it needs to be able to approve them in electricity.
The second task of the equipment was therefore to move a module for electricity producing by the solitary panneal weight of 17,5 tons, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After the movement, the equipment raised the re-deployment of the solitary panels of the module that have 76 meters.
And there is that one of the panels, who spread as agreements, has been cut off about a meter by a cab that has been conceived.
The deployment has been stopped so that the panel should not be disappeared.
The astronauts, which were in the origin to make a control exit from the Discovery ship, then go to repair another solar panel which the rotation system was defective, have seen the contrast to save themselves to the indomain panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to carry out about 30 meters of the telecommunicated arm of the ship added to the station to make the reparation.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
Grand, staying, very arrogant, he touched him very developed and long arms.
In 46 years, this training doctor was therefore loaded to be "operating" the sun panel "beauty".
After exceedingly inspection of the disagreements, he sectioned the sinful cabin and installed sorts of 'axes' on the endommaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" staying near the sax and, inside, by the other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the team's commander.
The tool that he used, a hokey mini-canne developed by isolant to disappear the electrocution on the sun panels produced several hundreds of backs, was designed and broken by the astronauts at the station.
Once the operation was finished, Scott Parazynski expected that the panel would be completely developed before the invention of its tools and to reach the station within.
Yesterday after midnight, the astronauts benefited from a half day of detention before today, seven astronauts do not reach the Discovery ship for a return on the Mercedy Planet.
The EADS Title in Bourse
The EADS action is currently low down to Paris's bourse, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it should be expensed between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to face the A400M retards.
The EADS loss 4% to 21.96 euros at the Bourge of Paris.
The group was committed to review its operational results for 2007 after the late progress of the A400M engine, which consists of the inaugural air.
The cost to spend the late time in the delivery of its military transport airports, announced in October, was numbered between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros with more than 1 billion euros for Airbus, announced the mother's house of the European EADS construction.
In accordance with these charges, EADS will be contrary to announce new objectives of exploitation results (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its next judicial trimestrial results, without any more encrypted specifications.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is coherent with the six months later.
Remember, the operational result of EADS was 86% in 2006, essentially because of charges related to the latest of another programme, the very big A380 porter.
Initially, the Group proposed a first delivery of A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The selection of the status
There will be no suspension on the outcome of the urin: Russians will massage the party of the President Poutine, Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, seeing the authorism, after a very locked campaign.
At three days of the legislation elections, the Russian President Vladimir Poutine address to the electorers today a television message on public chains, already recorded but the content is stored secretly.
He makes it as a single list of Russia, the pro-Kremlin part of which the victory is exclaiming.
Yesterday, the President had nothing left to transmit by receiveing foreign ambassadors, with pleasure to deliver a new charge against the West accused of inheritance - his prediction theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy, and we want honest choices, the most transparent and openest, no choices," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far away from the account.
She denied a pressing campaign.
The Communist Leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there was no choices too sale, even at Eltsine's time.
After the repression of the exposure of the last weekend, the ex-champion of the world of escape Garry Kasparov, condemned at five days of prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited to visit according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet Humanity”
After these without suspension laws, two more open questions are profiled:
- Who will happen in Poutine to the President?
The Office Journal has published yesterday the date of the first tour of the Presidency on 2 March 2008; the candidates have to be known until 23 December.
Eleu in 2000 and reached in 2004, Vladimir Poutine cannot break a third consecutive mandate.
Or no successive.
- What role will Poutine play after March?
First Minister?
Leader of the Parliamentary majority and the powerful party of Russia, who would choose the Government and the President?
Whatever, legislation as the President, the power that comes out will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the Soviet human, they do not feel masters of their destination, ” says Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The history of Nikolai Kopossov, the University of Saint-Petersburg, was far away: civil society has been late in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has stopped the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Poutine renewed with the model of a fathernist State, perfectly accepted by the population of more than this new fathernalism was not followed by fear, but by a certain economic assistance,” referred to Mary Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “renew completely the personal responsibility” which they had made letterly proved after the USS exposure.
“What is good to think?”
The phenomenon touchs all social layers, including the world of business.
And the administrative election hears the state where 65 rulers (with 85 russian rules) are guided by the United Russian local lists.
New freedoms imported from West are often synonyms of caos, such as in the 90s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, professor of 54 years: “What is good to think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why to change them? ”
A lot of memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi Archives of Bad Arolsen, which retreat the destinations of 17,5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are free access.

As the homosexuality proposed or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or decision mandates established by Gestapo were collected after war in a practical purpose: finding citizens carried out or submitted to the obligatory work and, in particular, bring them a evidence of their internality to open their way to their indemnation.
Moreover in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent soldiers treat tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
“ There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents,” said Pr Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre on Antisemitism in Berlin's Technical University.

A new festival sees the day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promotor/productor announces Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our business, it is a honour to work with a person who, at least or at least, inspired the current movement of the festivals in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the festival Lollapalooza de Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is an essential destination for the camping.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private shadow of 500 acres at about 40 minutes of Philadelphia.
Again known under the name of Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respective feast producers in the world.

Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to get the hollywood films in Montreal when no other than Terminator is opposed...
This deduction mission is part of delegated functions.
A mandate - 'politically difficult' because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the 'runningy productions'.
Is it hard to play in the "Governator" pattes?
"It must be careful, it is the industry that decides where she goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she's going.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best."
The course of the festivals
However, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of the cinema from here.
The course of Oscars is started.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Côte, which is the Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or the San Francisco, to present the chebecic films, to make them value and to ensure that the realizers make interviews.
The age of darkness had a beautiful victory at 30 Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the show in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
The Quebec also presented four long and four shorts in the American Film Institute Festival this month.
And there will be a year-end rally in Burs? experts divided by the sub-prices crisis.
At least five weeks of the cluster of the exercise, the investors have already smoothed their hands in hope of the traditional rallye at the end of the year.
However, this year experts are not even certain that it will happen.
Banif believes that "on the statistical view, the month of December in Burs is generally a positive manner.
However, it is not necessary to make provisions exclusively based on statistics, since the current context is given, incertitudes guarantee markets, at least on the short term. "
Although they are not partial to take the bourg for the last weeks of the year, these experts notice that "the boursier market is food through the existence of liquidity, which is available to invest the missing of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of escape to quality values as well in the long-term periods as in courts."
For this reason, they believe that the bourse will have a more lot of behavior, not exceeding volatilities "sortout because we don't know the impact of the potential levels of the Fed, given the high level of brute and the risk of the stimulation of inflationist tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI ventures in Spain, is agreed that it's not the good time to say that there's a rally.
"It's not the best thing," ensures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish boursier index, has lost about 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
John Solana, intermoney analysis, believes that Ibex 35 could lock the year to 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to the retraits regimes that are produced for years during these dates.
However, the expert claims that things will be a little different in this year since he believes that the rally will be located from the second week of December after the party of the Constitution (6 December).
The analysis does not consider that volatility will affect market trends.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analysis of Inversis Banko, assesss that we are near technical levels and "the reason we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provided in accordance with information that comes from the European Union on the consequences of the crisis on the market of credits."
The analyst hopes that these are positive.
Analyses are agreed to choose the values that will be responsible for Ibex to new maximum costs.
Solana, from Intermoney, tell me that "the great values are back for him."
The expert would include the two large banks and some constructors "perceive that when the date is approaching, the electric sector will be very nice."
While, Federico Olucha, Investis Banko ensures that the hills will be from the bank and the industry sector.
Builders can also benefit from this rally, in the case they are in place.
"ACS reaches positions since a few months and hopes that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of revenues in Noël's saison.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will also make it very well, although in this case there are no many representatives on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only during two opportunities on December was a low month.
The agency of the year's end rally was in 2003, during which the burden markets were exceeded from the crisis provoked by the perception of the technological bullet.
This year, during which Ibex 35 received 28,17 %, the month of December recorded a highest of 6,68 %.
It should be considered if it is the fiveth year of winning (for the time Ibex increased 8,36% since January) and if he succeeded on the computer on his final year rally.
The Popular Bank opens 200 open offices 12 hours from Sunday
The Popular Bank decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These sucursals, which will be operated under the Popular Max Mark, represent a big change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group who decided to start looking at the uninterrupted opening of its agents to 20h30, and to open Saturday from 10:30 to 20h30.
Another group that also repeated several times he wanted to increase the time of its sugar, BBVA, even though he has not decided to do the first step.
It is about to conclude a agreement with syndicates to close 75% of its agents on the Sabbath instead of opening a afternoon, but not to public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decided for other organs to add or not to this initiative that corresponds to the time of trade.
This is exactly this objective that looks for the Popular Bank.
Attach autonome customers that run in these areas to make their companies in the PMEs and the business of the selected streets to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agents implanted over Spain at about 18 months, because it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
For this reason, the organization will modernize the sucursals already in trade areas, adapting them to the profile of customers of various streets.
In this way, the improvement of the time is compatible with a different concept inside the smoking and a new design, more currently, with lighter colors.
The bank trade responsibility, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not affect great investments, but that the employment number will increase six to eight or nine by agency.
Agencies, which will also have spaces to gather the PMEs here, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in Madrid's three agents.
And the experience was positive, like Angel Rivero.
Murillo Brave Streets, O'Donnell and the Grand Via of Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and appear to be successful, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank has currently 2.500 sugars.
And 60 others operated under the World Credit mark, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which even opened lunch and feast days.
In these PopularMax Agencies, they do not copy the model of the BBVA, where many of their agents have a large event of non-financial products for its selling.
We don't want to concurrence with our clients, note Rivero.
For this time, they arrived to a telephone agreement to sell mobile phones, with a external person at the bank.
Double telecyno for the first time the value in Bourse of his Rival Antena 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paul Vasile, a delegated counseler of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the lock of the boursier market, when he concluded that the string he leaded double the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One single aspect threatened his joy: "What does me wrong, isn't the fact that we have increased but we are less low," he said.
However, he put the accent on the fact that on a low market, we're less broken.
Telecino has finished yesterday with a progress of 2,54 %.
This wine sets its loss to 15,66% for a year.
The value in Bourse of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % of the capital) and announced by Vocent (13 % in more) is also 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg's data.
His Rival Antena 3, which ceased yesterday 1,52% and accumulating a decrease of 40,5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications undertaken in Bourse is up to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the Prisa (the 5-day editor) and 1.779 million in the Vocent.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antenne 3 is the fact that we are talking about two similar businesses.
The related fact represents what we can do on the same market, to what price and how we renew it in audience terms.
Telecinco announced last week that he would be the first chain of television to exceed over 1,000 million of brute public income, such as Giuseppe Tringali, the Delegated Advisor of Telesinco and Publispa, the officer that supports the publicity of the group.
In order to be real, the television chain should be registered for the exercise at the end of 3,6 % in its publication in relation to 965,4 million of the 2006 exercise.
For its part, the pure fabrication of Antenne 3 increased 1,6% in the first nine months of exercise (as to achieve 734,4 million) while the net income of TV increased 0.7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that analists point for the best development of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payment that he has been maintained until now: in 2006, the President of Alejandro Echevarya has distributed 100 % of the benefit between its actions.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio may varie after the end of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be capable of reaching our actions, to whom we have already given tickets with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to the analysis, the market gives fatigue signs at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced the estimates of the benefits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4 % and 2009, at 7 %.
This is due to explain, at the bottom of the growth of 10,5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the prevalence of Antenna's profits 3 to 4,5 % in 2008 and at 7,5 % in 2009.

The Law also requires investment services to develop information on the market on the key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms, and it is required to have a register of all operations which they implement, to facilitate control of the CNMV part.
Following the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one who demonstrates that the titlerized debts will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk for the investment, which has been shown with what happened with the US Hypothecs of high risk (subpression).
Furthermore, they have benefited from the transposition of the direction to delimit legally the functions that the diplomats in Economy may have 30 years after it was approved in 1977, the royal decree that declines the professional functions reserved to economists.
For its part, the Senat has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for a business account, which will not require the CNMV authorisation and which can offer new clients to various investment enterprises at the same time.

The Civil Guard has stopped today at the beginning of the morning the current mutual community of Totana (de Popular Party) because of its relationship with the city corruption train discovered this week.
Furthermore, one of the Secretarys of the Municipal Council and the Governor of the Municipality Police have been arrested.
Joseph Martínez Andreo replaced the last month of May John Morales, current deputy of the right, and even to advise the municipality of the Mauritius, and who, according to the sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'mentioner' of this tragedy.
The agents continue to promote the municipal locals and the advice of Urbanism and are not exceeding the possibility of new arrests in the next hours.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the city corruption train, discovered at the beginning of this week, was inputed.
As the SER Chaine was indicated yesterday to the representative of the President's 'popular part' Juan Morales, it was stopped by exiting from the house of Morales with the important documentation in its possession on the train.
Furthermore, according to the research sources, the investigation is the examination of Morales committees to facilitate the signature of a citizen agreement with a structural company of Galician to recognize 200 landing hectares.

Bono agrees to be at the head of the candidate of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the elections
The ex-minister of the Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the case of the socialists will win the general elections.
So the Secretary of Organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, Joseph Blanco, and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that was at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The ruler of the Executive has justified the offer made to the ex-minister because it's important to count on the best" in the political life and Bono "he's among the best."
In addition, he submitted that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside the Congress if socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marin as President of the Congress, which has published on 15 November last, his decision to not be presented to the next general elections and to leave its political carrier to combat the climate change in the university framework.
The ex-minister recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped to imitate that he returns to the political warrant since he has left it two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, even if citizens already know who will be the Economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party won the elections, his party wanted to announce the Congress in a "transparency Act".
If he gets the post, Bono hopes to transform the room into "the house of respect and not of insult or cried" and to make it "seems more in the citizens."
"It seems seriously that the only local of Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government in Senat has been interrupted in some cases 26 times."
In the same way, he had an elogian word for his current President, Manuel Marin and "we know" and he didn't want to do as if he had already busy his position to not fall, as he noted, in what his adversaries could be considered "a domination".
A climate propagand
Since the movement against climate change is submitted to a persecution without mercy also the sections of its preventions and those who give priority to other political and social wars, it must demonstrate a ferry coherence.
In addition, it is the case for a leader of movement who is President of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than the islamic terrorism and that is even proposed to sign a new contract for the planet.
This approach is necessary to explain why action, or inaction, has contributed to the Government in a decision that Spain is to the head of the European Union in the implementation of Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not ejected it.
Furthermore, it must explain clearly to Spanish what measures he will take to fresh climate change.
What companies will be affected, which standards of citizens should be changed, which individual and collective energy economy will be committed to us to do, what economic consequences it will provoke.
That's what, who's going to sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
But there's no explanation there, and there will be no explanations.
Exactly because he's offering himself and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures are involving.
Costs, incompatible and incompatible for enterprises and individual accounts.
Before the centuries of the essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party, he had readily seen as dangerous in Zapataro that he had been impressed by near.
It's saying that it's to save the planet with nothing, only with propagand, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With terms that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this Lord is so useful for electoral campaigns who do not speak, who does not denounce and does not require, embarrass meetings and inspires tender.
It is only limited to be a pure virtual contracting part and does not suggest that we move in bicyclet or refresh us with the event.

My treatment doctor spoke to me of one of his articles on strange researchs: "The money produces cerebral activities, especially if others receive less."
It means that the feelings generating the monthly payment of workers depends on what colleagues win.
The study was completed by magnetics to the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last Science number.
According to Bernd Weber, the study and director of the group loaded by neurocognition images of the Life &Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest active action occurred when the participant answered correctly and his company failed."
The researchers observed that when both people had to receive the same payment, the action was moderate, but if one of them had received the double, the active was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Procureur of Balkans
Carla del Ponte since eight years continued immediately the Balkan's war criminals from the public Ministry of the Penal Tribunal for the ex-Yougoslavia, who is located in La Haye.

What ensure do I have to do?
Automatic ensure, which covers the driver faces left events, implies an important expenditure that depends on various factors such as age, sex, ancientity of the permission to drive, civil state, the type of vehicle to ensure or use that it is actually, among others.
There's a car that's the main.
And it is that, choosing the right car safe is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, choosing the correct autosurvey, it is even more difficult to choose the model of the vehicle.
The autosurance is a agreement between a security company and the assessment.
This commitment is materialized by a security contract, which establishs that the company receives the value of the first agreed and it is responsible for the obligation to pay the indemnisation in the case of the left.
The price is the price of ensure, which has taken account of various factors, such as age, sex, ancientity of the permission to drive, civil state, the type of vehicle to ensure or use that is actually used among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that the possibility of achievement of accident is higher, more the cost to raise is higher.
That is why people of over 25 years and women have to pay lower prices, since statistics show that these people have a lower level of lower than their property.
In the same way, in service of reviews, companies concluded that married persons have tendencies to have less accidents than helibators.
The use that the vehicle is made will affect frequency, and thus the probability of a accident.
In increased frequency, the probabilities increase.
They are many variables that insurances take into account at establishing the price of the price.
That is why the driver must well study the situation to choose the auto-survey that adapts the best to his profile.
Here we will express the most significant variables when you choose one or another type of ensure, so that it, in addition to apply to the assurer characteristics, offers him a reasonable price.
Youths of less than 25 years have to face several unconvenients in the time of transiting a contract with a assessment to a accessible price, such as it may be the weak experience in the conduct and the oldness of the permission to drive.
Although the ideal to be well ensure is a certain risk, there are other more economic options.
The most preceding drivers can operate for a risk insurance with franchise, so that they get the covers of a risk insurance, but a more accessible price.
This form of convention implies that the client pays a part of the left amount.
"The part of the left amount that the version client will be established in accordance with the value of the price, which will be higher than the counter will be low", defined Luis Noguera, the responsible in Spain of First Europe, the Internet security mediator.
Another option is the ensuring of third-large, so that the client ensures the protection to face threatens, but for those caused on his own car.
Furthermore, he would be covered against the flight, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A counsel.
If you are less than 25 years ago trying to be careful and to escape the left in the measure of the possibility, since it will be reflected on the bonification, which can reduce the price of ensure in the future.
A bonification is a reduction of the basic tariff with the company.
In contrast, a sanction is a majority of the base tariff.
"Blessings and sanctions will depend on society and benefits of it.
If the company has been a good year, she could be allowed to increase the wellifications ", cleared Noguera.
After 25 years, it becomes easier for drivers to pass a contract with ensure, since the left rate is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That's why it's favorable to choose a certainty all risks with French.
"Normally, youths cannot benefit from experience to the prevalent accommodation after a accident," ensures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most of the accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the ' fear of the news. '
However, if the customer is married, but yet there is no children it is preferable to negotiate a certainty at all risk, since his economic situation allows him to be.
Women with children are considered by security as people with the least left rate, because most of them will be low.
In this case, the best ensure would be an ensure to all risks with frank (because 300 euros), or a third-large ensure from the third year of life of the vehicle when the assessment has a high level of bonification.
"They have a more detonated conduct and they have a greater power to achieve the luxury to assume a more important quantity of franks," judge Luis Noguera.
For retraits, a risk of a risk with franchisis is preferable (with this is 150 euros), or a third-large ensure when the guarantee has a high level of bonification.
It is necessary to say that automobile ensure is something important, not only because it covers the driver faces of the left, but also because it represents an important expenditure, it is therefore fundamental to study conveningly the ensure that is most likely according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point to Milan to arrive at the eightth end
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow measured next March in San Siro in search of the point that they missed to get their respective objectives in the closement of the challenges of Champions, because he serves Italians to be first and the Ecossais to be classified.
The Italians totalize ten points and have already been qualified during the fifth day by a match nul in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, which has six, and who receives Benfice who has four points, does not pass before it.
These two matches of the D Group will be played a week before the sixth day is finished, since Milan AC has to discuss the seventh ends of the Coupe of the World of the Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in search of a place for the end of 16 December.
So this group will be closed before the match nowhere in the stage Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams are trying to go out victorious, because the Italians will not want to specify their houses and the Keltic Glasgow knows that it would be the first and would have a better cross in the eightth end.
A disface of the Gordon Strach team could be enough to class if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it can't only be computered on it because with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they won (2-0) in the other direction.
Thus, the Millers try to impose the evening at schools, who have good hope to class for the eighth end for the second time at the League Championship, after they were baptized during the last editing by a goal of Kaka during the prolongations (1-0).
By expecting the triomphe's victory, the triomphe would only return to Shakhtar, in the case of the Celtic would lose, to class for the eighteen ends to continue the EUFA campaigns.
And it is that Benfice, although it is the last and without the opportunity to continue the European competition, could get the third place with a victory.
20,000 people assisted in Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada), before about 20,000 spectators, their first turn since the group was resolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) declared a little time before starting their concert at the GM Place of Vancouver stage that the meeting of the group is "brilling".
For more than 20,000 people have broken the ballets to assist the concert that has made a video in which the group's history has been struck at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour is involved with the launch of a new album that reaches their major success and two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls were moved on the scene showing the bracelets that the wife of Posh Spice had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sport was in the public that filled the GM Place, even if Victoria had prohibited him a few days ago.
Before the beginning of the spectacle, Victoria Beckham noticed that the British footballer has not seen our costs so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the spectacle.
'Sporty Spice', who is part of the group in 1998 ' because of the differences between us ' and who has proposed the resolution of the group two years later, expressed its nervousness during a treatment with pressure, two hours before the beginning of the spectacle.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of people changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm happy to take a decision," said Chisholm on the meeting of the group that she has resolved for nine years ago.
The song also noted that since the time, "The things are arranged and we appreciate much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls were exposed for the last time in 1998.
To begin, according to the CTV television, the group came to Vancouver in a special airport of Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived to the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They count to her five seven sons.
After the Concert of Vancouver, the group will be presented in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid, they will be held on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is the alarm.
A discussion on the price of the fermentary gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increased the risks of impact on air exports to Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (E.U.) are convicted by gases, and each conduct is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fire, it will increase the transit taxes to Russia.
The last year, a change between both had caused a reduction of supplies to the United States.
The last discussion between Kiev and Moscow after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, the Russian property monopole society, which produced the gas, was trying to find a agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided for Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that he would increase as proposed, his price to Ukraine saw that he accepted payment for 2008, to 50% more for gas offering from the neighbor Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would be for Ukraine, a increase of 40% of the costs of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversation, remembering that we are a country over which most gas passes,” announced the Ukraine Ministry of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuter Press Agency.
“The gas cost fluctuation would certainly be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (with West Europe) via Ukraine”
The last big alternative between Moscow and Kiev was caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom offers destined to Ukraine.
This has introduced the cut of exports to Western Europe, thus increased prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the provisions of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even if most of them are still under development.
Accordingly, Gazprom completed its own offerings with the gas originating from Turkmenistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'to control its foreign employees'.
The Ministry of Scotland Health must improve the controls to carry out on its extra Community employees to check if they have penalities, he declared the Control Committee.
The warning of the General Review, Robert Black, occurred after an alien doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the airport of Glasgow in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed his concern on the fact that the Ministry of Scotland Health has no specific data on the number of other people only work.
His report has also held on other decision-making controls, correctly conducted on a model of five health authorities.
The General Reviewer has carried out controls on the Community's extra personnel immediately at the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, Iraqian or originary doctor in the service of the Royal Alexandra of Paisley hospital, was stopped at the airport after he had worked with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was part of three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, because they suspected to be involved in several cars explosion trials in the United Kingdom.
The Health Ministry should carry out pre-employed controls on the other-mer personnel, to be certain of the validity of their qualities, experiences, and work permission for the United Kingdom.
Although the Ministry of Ecosy Health uses the Scotland Disployment to perform penalties, the Agency has no right to get such information outside the Great Britain.
In many warnings, the report of the General Reviewer now states that the committees are to be confronted with the Office of Penal President Control, allowing the employees to carry out controls on various countries.
“Which we have discovered that certain information about the personnel have been well checked, it is not every time done."
Mr. Black stated that the Ministry of Ecossais Health carried out the majority of the primary controls that he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report is increasingly improved in order to ensure that adequate information on certain members of the other personnel should be available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of the BMA Ecosse stated that it was "extremely unprobable" that the previous employment controls could identify the employees that are subject to future terrorist acts.
He said, "The report suggests that the previous employment controls are currently implemented, work well in the economic health system and that it is not sure that these warnings may bring some added value."
The economic health authorities have stated that 1161 persons were employed for most doctors and sisters.
However, the general reviewer submitted that these numbers must be cleared to the highest, in particular because of problems relating to identifying members of the undefined contracts, which could be chosen or not, in our country.
The research showed that the current health control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are actually appropriate.
These controls are carried out on passport, work permissions and qualifications.
The Economic Government reviews its political policy and its pre-employed control system for members of the other oceans of health services.
The Secretary-General of Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was encouraging to accomplish this work after the terrorist attack on the airport of Glasgow."
It added that the economic Government associated with the Health Committees would consider carefully the warnings listed in the report that should be published in the next month, and would ensure to ensure a better implementation of the previous employment controls recently updated, and valid for all employees, including other persons.

The Saoudite Araby has explained yesterday that 208 military involving organic cells handing an immense attack on a petrolier site, as well as attacks against the churches and armed forces.
The television of the most largest world exporter of petrole exporter has stated that one of the missions against banks cells.
Al Qaeda sympathists have set a campaign against the alliance monarchie in the United States since 2003, after Iraq's invasion.
An eight military cell, directed by an alien resident planned an attack against a petrolier site in the Eastern Province, declared the TV journal.
Saoudite Arabia rapidly constituted a group of 35,000 military to protect sites, after a failure attack from Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest petrolier site in Abqaiq.
The journal quoting a declaration of the Minister of the inner, stated that 18 of the arrested persons are a cell directed by a "mixed launch expert" which has been infiltrated in the country.
It is said that the military soldiers planned against eight missile bands in the Kingdom.
22 of the prisoners seemed to have fulfilled the assembly murder and armed forces.
The Government requested the churchs to make more against the Saudis guided in Iraq, to join the Al Qaeda military fighting against the Allied Forces and the Muslim government held in the United States, considered as a heritage according to the hard line of Sunny Saudites.
Al Qaeda military men think that in Saudi Arabia many churchs have cooperated with the authorities to support the Kingdom family policy governing the government.
Militariers, encouraging by calls launched against the Saoudite Government for Western, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saoudite origin, had targeted foreign resident areas, government buildings and energy provider sites.

Entre the prisoners, 32 persons are accused to subvention the military.
The climate of Venus could reflect the future of the Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was a pleasant planet to live.
The data issued from the European ship in orbit have demonstrated that the planet is probably two times smaller than the Earth, in contrast to what we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet.
These two worlds are often the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
The scientists now believe that there were billions of years, Venus could have had a similar conditions to the earth, and could even have been resident.
But the serious effect of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to the sun radiations associated with a late rotation, leading Venus to all other types of evolution.
Today, the planet is private of water, is ravaged by orugans and light tempests and has a long-term surface of temperature to fund the plomb.
The inventors of Venus Express, the Sunday of the European Spatial Agency, who studied the planet for a year, offers a serious vision of the potential future of the Earth due to the catastrophical changes of climate.
The teacher of the physical department of Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of Venus Express, said: “We begin to understand why Venus climate is so different from the earth, although the planetes in them are practically similar.
“ Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which there were billions of years, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, even with a habitable surface.”
The urinium enriched by the police.

Mitt Romney declared not to be high as candidate to the President to answer the questions of a good man of snow.
Despite this, the Republican candidates to the President finally agreed to participate in the YouTube debate, during which many regular electorers have recorded their questions, they support the candidates.
Wednesday 28 November, no of the issues issued by You Tube, when a good man of snow requested the democracies their position in relation to the repair of the planet.
But this time, questions and answers have reflected much the conditions of the Republic party, candidate to the next elections.
We don't know what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsors the debate, have chosen You Tube's clips to show candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest approach of one theme, has been focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some phone electers when they heard pleasant things: the Government has higher approval when the candidates expressed greatly.
The most hard and the longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney, who is in the head of the important elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to reliable the fact that he was agreed about the Clandestine immigration during his masterman of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, to employ Clandestian Immigrants in his house.
The two fighters were particularly feeded when they were asked if they were ready to promote a "amenesia" (of offering a regular statute and the possibility of become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressist of Colorado, has succeeded to enhance this issue.
No one of them has the opportunity to be chosen, but they both remain in the course, may be grateful for the fact that they have started fighting the immigration before and increasingly than others.
In general, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same opinions: the most rich borders, and zero tolerance for the cistern immigrants.
This subject, related to concerns in particular by the case of toxic games made in China, or other fears against the external world, favorite the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertary and Catholic conservators.
However, the debate has been particularly amazing when other subjects have been submitted.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had maintained the campaign for armed control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney have debated to know if we put water into the dog should be considered as a torture.
One of the interviewers asked whether the candidates believed in their entirely, in the Bible’s content.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about believeing in the history of Jonas and Baleine.
Another interviewer asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of death.
We were not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in a position in Iowa during a recent election, through his long-date Christian Christians - to say that death painful is as much as necessary.
When we were encouraged to know whether Jesus had been prospered, he was laughing and said that Jesus was too young to present himself to the elections.
Human race remains unsolvedly open.
The rebound of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa agrees with the recent wonderful research of subventions made by the Libertannium Ron Paul, and the sifflements in the March discussion.
These two are emerged by the butter, thanks to the fact that the two protected parties are not agreed to decide who is the most known and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the part of good hour and convinced by a success message on the largest American, taking close to the leaders.
This time the part is divided and the result is far away from being clear.
Workinglist pains
Gordon Brown has discovered a new brown in which it was sown; even if he had demissioned, the situation wouldn't change.
See the trend of the British scannes, this is not particularly judicial.
No decorations sold, no parisian hotels of politicians, no extra supply feet.
But there is a evidence that a rich man of business would have built up for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Working Party, equal to $650,000 ($1.3 m), which the party would not have stated: a new battle that Gordon Brown would have passed well.
Two months ago, the first Ministry went back in his election project, insultantly insulting the British intelligence proclaiming that the opinions have not influenced his decision, and that he would hope to offer a compatible and effective government.
In contrast, Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Leader of Democracy, stated that Mr. Brown was transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's racket, a difficult bank at the crack border, has shown a failure of the directives and a medium judge in the case of urgency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the code of impotents have proposed a coalition of industrial groups against government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the authorities of the impotents has declared an incredible administrative burden.
A general triumph of the retrait has launched a revolution among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of military expenditure: they have proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is a part-time employment for them.
In the present time, the supply of loud donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary of Works (and his former overseer) did that they had to demission.
Nothing of that means that Mr. Brown is immediately guided to the exit.
However, governments may come to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't love politicians, and they don't trust in them, but they generally lose their doubts in the event of a new government.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister cannot improve the things, neither yet government for a long time when he risks the suspension: public administration does not work anymore; the officers of the Ministers make the bill; the pressure of the bad history; and the government becomes a defense and no more objective.
In the meaning, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot be able to be an initiative.
Although he wanted to republish Tony Blair, he was also his higher leader.
The problems related to the North Rock and the data of the positions, for example, are linked to the decisions of Mr. Brown taken when he was a chance of the British treatment.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's males, such as the long-term investigation on the funds of the party 's money account for the members of the Lords' room, the electorers could think the contrary.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is not so tragic that it is.
The gass are not so monstruous as the members of the Tourist Party believe it.
Like Mr. Bean, there's no victims or slaughter.
And the meditation, although painful, could be concretted by Mr. Brown's stalinian trends forever, for a faithful and seriously brutal government.
The new scanning on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular person who compare his gifts to love, stated that he would not want any public recognition of his favorite.
He may have his opinion, but it's not to decide him.
The laws against the anonymate of great policy subventions are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who has declared to be at the current programmes of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the responsibility of subvention collections that had spoken of certain donations in October.
But until here Mr. Brown is not implied: Nothing let me think that it was at the end of these beginnings, even though most of the payments had been made after his coming to the government in June.
Before this is the first Ministry has done half.
He was quickly condemned the legislative failure of his party, but he didn't take attention on the fact that the decision-making authority was on a thing he knows well, to review an investigatory committee on the subject of an expert on the retraite and a judge.
In this case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's the police's resort.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown should do, such as finding a permanent president for the independent public life standards, without leaders since six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of the political parties.
This would attach the Working Party at a low time to cooperate with the Tories, which could bring it to renew its special financial report with confidences; shortly, a friendly pillar for a party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The part of the conservators now have a good benefit for elections; he has two years to recover the electorers, and the only way to get a victory is to demonstrate an unreprovidable and solid competence.
Card slots.
Would the crisis of the hypothecs be considered the US market of credit cards?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see attracted nageories, turn around.
Now when the American immobilier market passes through a critical phase, predators are in the US market of credit cards.
Goldman Sachs' analyses think that losses related to credit cards could get $99 billion if the county is exceeding hypothecs to other credit forms to the consumer.
Tension signs are clearly visible.
There are high levels in the costs and insolvency, which measures the parts of the unrecoverable budget or which are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced the last month that he took $1.4 billion in his consumer credits, in particular because of the weakness of card ports.
He's still too early to panic.
Prices and insolvency are still moded.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the insolvency rates of 3,89% of the third trimester is less than one point in relation to its average history.
The deterioration of the tax is partly explainable by technical factors.
An amendment of the laws in 2005 to the United States, on the personal bank route, has caused an abrupt cut of bank route archives, which were carried out of several losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency) could increase even if the conditions of emphasis should be emphasised.
The industry announces more than fixed payment rates, which relies the sum of monthly decline that consumers should regulate.
and the confidence in the safety of the capital of credit cards is sufficiently strong, although the paralysis of other aspects of the structured financial.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% above the last year.
The direct infection links between the crisis of hypothecs and the market of credit cards are sure: consumers could prefer to increase their finishments now that the equitable immobilier premises have lost.
But the card emissions are more attention to the flux of species instead of the value of the patrimoine, and thus the cutting of the immobilier prices has not caused a change in the creditability of the employers.
They could even offer benefits to credit tickets.
The prices for consumers for the payment of hypothecs are disappeared if the properties cost less than the value of the empiror; thus, the credit card detention would be a priority to repeat everything.
Card emissions are able to respond much faster than hypothecares and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, because they can change interest rates or attach the credit limits.
This should reduce the risk of a quick recurrence of action.
“We're not going to wake up a morning and review all the emphasiss,” said Gary Perlin, Director of Capitol One.
If a financial catastrophe of the credit card market is unprobable, there are strong risks to have a consecutive low.
If the lower prices of immobilier and a contract in the credit market bring America to the reception, the industry must certainly face a macabre future.
Be careful to the dorsal nageories.
The British banks are injured to the case of Enron.
The three British bankers who had to go to witness their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the previous Financial Director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, in order to make mercredi crimes.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocently of the seven accusations for collusour presumed fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial screw to requiring their employees.
They should be presented to the court in January.
But during an audience predicted by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they were all declared guilty to have committed a fraud.
The three ex-sided Greenwich NatWest, a PLC group officer of the Royal Bank of Ecosse, has been celebrated everywhere in Greenwich because of extradition procedures that have been two years.

The accusations that had been infected in 2002 have understood Fastow that it was the investigation of the Government in the Enron debuilt.
The accusations against bankers, named "Tree of Natwest" said to come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraud scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a office of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the center in the scene of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him to call the bank route procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest for the officer as no, but the three britains have already known its value.
A company controlled by Kopper buyed the interest of the office bank for $1 million.
Bankers paid $25,000 to Kopper as interested for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow would failly announce to Enron that the energy company was available to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the office.
But actually, these 20 million dollars have gone into the boxes of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have received $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would win $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow rejoiced his active role in two conspirations in the Enron debuilt.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow ends a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisian.
Kopper is arrested for three years and one month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British have been released after a payment of $1 million each, which is obligated to live in the United States during the process.

The exploitation has offered thousands of licences, more than 60 billion dollars of loss of market and more than $2 billion loss for the retrait plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the ex-President Jeffrey Skilling have been condemned last year for their implication in the creation of society.
Skilling was condemned over 24 years of prison.
The accusations against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other delicts have been lost because of his death was due to a heart crisis last year.

Cyrurgian unacceptable suspect of murder in New Jersey
It was the kidney of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked on the vineyard of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed a ambulance that came to stop at the white Cape Cod gates on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police's pattern arrived.
And then another.
"Therefore I saw the medical vehicle to stop," Mr. Livingston, a restaurant's responsible one, said mercredi.
That's what I realized somebody was deceived.
The authorities will then learn that the deceited person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant of the Director of the Newark police Department.
Now researchers try to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gest executed by an unaccepted cosmetic surgery, that the police has not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for confidence, the results of the toxic tests that will take time, but they should allow to resolve this mysterious death that has attacked the high rangs of Newark's police.
Mrs. Arroyo was the assistent of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tension," Mr. McCarthy stated about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview, mercredi. ”
"It was like a ball pig"
“It would have done everything to protect me”
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married in Jimmy Arroyo, a former officer of Newark's police, who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons of 14 and 11 years and a beautiful fill.

Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates related to the debt of the world.
The actions were explored from the two costs of Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the conditions of credit, reducing further promus interests by the relevant statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank.
Bursy markets explore in London, New York and part in Europe after Donald Kohn, #2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who are disappeared should be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the active financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the irregular markets seeing these new tensions related to credit, Mr. Kohn stated that recent turbulency has been "inverted certain improvements in the functioning of the end of September and October.
In the case of this severe turbulence, it would increase the probabilities of the further strictness of financial conditions for owners and enterprises.
These comments appear to investors as a clear sign that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capitals in the US markets, and that other reductions of interest could establish credit conditions.
These notes also allowed Wall Street to calm with news more worse on the American economy, such as the largest low of immobilier selling for October.
The reviews of this financial tumbling have been accented after the declaration of Bear Stearns, investment bank, preaching that it would have 650 persons, that it would be 4% of its personal, to reduce the costs to compensate the losses of both lossed couples of immobilier companies.
20 posts are provided only in London where the bank works 1500 people.
In New York, Down Jones' average industry increased 331 points, or 2,55% concluding at 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index has taken 165.5 points to 2,7% concluding to 6306.2, adding more than 39 £ to the value of the British society.
The German Dax index increased 2,6% and the French CAC40 took 2,3%.
First, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets has been reached by a strong demand for three months funds referred to by the European Central Bank, which has carried these preparations to the European trade banks in several rate of 4,7%, the most highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the FED and the ECB and to inject further funds in London financial markets that carried out credit tensions, have made that the rate of three months “Libor” of the British banks has caused their highest growth since September 6,59% since 12 November.
The English calls to a judge in relation to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We're faced to two dilemmas, one as hard as the other.
Who will be the battery #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And more important in a larger context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Grahney, President of the electorers who were here exceptionally to help Peter Moores, leader of teacher, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, President of the General Director of England, began to fill the candidate forms to become a national elector, at least a part-time.
He who doesn't get to load the dose no.6 will be unfair, but life is often unjust and the sport is also.
It's never easy to analyze what a man allows to happen to the top of his profession, while another will never happen outside the low level, sometimes by a missing chance more than the missing of happiness.
It's not just at the cricket that the choice is difficult, because at the end the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the good time to eat Bopara?
Is it just about Shah?
The same thing may be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Bannerjee 'tubby'?; both, new frameworks having received good diplomas, professionals, should be promus: but there is no place only for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a battery must be happy to touch the cricketer one day.
But capture the eyes of the electors is better complicated.
Many have done the last saison, for example, James Anderson who seemed to play the first test, even if Stephen Harmison had declared himself full form and continued to train.
Anderson took 32 first class doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same middle, but both have already lived their time to glory at the largest level and hoped to offer it again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's playing at the Asgirya stage, it's just a question of thinking.
This choice could be cutting or built the carrier of a man, but it makes a little differences.
For four years ago, at Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and successed in the first, with five gates and 40 useful tours, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struck for emergency, who succeeded to become the primary cricket of the Test, and that, although the fact that his double center marked against Australia could still be considered.
The probability provides that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and will favor the greatest experience of Shah against the experiencing of the young Bopara.
They both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and significant beginning in the instructions of 88 to Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, which is at 22ans seven younger years, and its excellent class at the launch.
But Shah did only ten tours in the two of his injections in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's Test, his city of Middlesex, and that, the immediate reject of the electors when Vaughan reformed, recalls his place for the next match, seems to have committed his students as clearly in Bombay.
In contrast to him, the player of Essex is full of joy to live.
Nothing fears him on a cricket ground and he exaggered when he recently caught on a 4x4 in a presentation of Volkswagen, the sponsor of England.
He reported only a lot of wounds, was shocked, even if the first thing he had done was to take his Vodaphone (sponsor well on) and to call Alastair Cook, his team who looked far away, to ask him if he had seen it?
Bopara is far from the best battery, his philosopher allows him to do services to go to him, and to fight with confidence and professionality.
Choosing a man just is one thing, choosing the good time is another.
Maybe this is the real art of the choice?
I would be proud to give his chance to Bopara, which doesn't mean that Shah doesn't have to apply if, as the tee sheets suggested, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buss bring people to work, and fight Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqian refugees from Syria arrived yesterday to Bagdad, disappearing these exits without money or without visa renews, or others who hoped that the city had found the normality.
Some have returned to fight the military men who have left them away from their house.
In the Mansour bus station, even before Damaskus arrived from 800 people carried out in 12 buses of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who were returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
"I'm back today because I saw the television and read in the journals what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is more sure now."
"They say that the Army Mahdi doesn't commit any more crimes!" he said, refering to the Shia military of the church military Moqtada al-Sadr, who has appointed his men to leave for the time.
Qassim al Atwani, a teacher Shia of 38 years of the area of Amariah dominated by Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could not renew his Syrian visibility, and because the regime stops the Iraqians to work.
His neighbors of Shia in Amaryah called him to report that the United States had helped military, allowed to take Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals of Jordan is the chief of a tribe Sunni and Shia who had to leave his house in the north of Baghdad because of an attack to the Grenade after he urged the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
“Then two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me I had put an anti-Qaeda military in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“ That's why I'm going today, ” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, of 62 years.
Many say that they have been attached by the growing accumulation of the capital since the American groups arrived, and continued to training of “involved citizens” well armed and collaborated with the American military to defend their neighborhood.
However, others say that they have been obligated to return because of the visa problem and the deadline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqians have been the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all of the visions that Nouri al-Maliki, the first Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two million and half people would have been from the country because of sectors of death.
"We had no problem until Al-Maliki comes to Syria and urged the government to not give visions to the Iraqians, to strengthen them to return to Iraq "declared Sunni retreatment.
“ I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I was gone. ”
The weight of violence may be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis has been removed from Shia's areas and at least versa, creating places where tensions are measured.
We are afraid that a sudden flow of refugees will not increase the sector tensions and return wars.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federated State is carried out in professional training, and it is brilliant even by the international orientation of its high schools.
It is only in a area that a Sarrois deficit is like the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the less feededed, by self-derision, shows for his 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Sarre training system, which is placed in the monitoring of the German Economic Institute of Columbia.
Thus, by tradition, high schools have been closely cooperated with the neighbor countries.
The university was based on Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Before this day, students have the opportunity to conclude their study by double, look a triple diploma.
The highest quota of 15.6% of stranger students is tested.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools over the average - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Sarre, on benefit of the professional training system," said Axel Plennecke, expert in training in IW.
More than one younger at five gets its study title in a professional school, so Sarre is sitting over seven points above the national average.
So the possibilities of combination of a professional and académic training are relatively developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double cursus panel is the second best in Germany.
While a practical training and a growing request, the number of engineering diplomas has been declined from one third in the past years.
That is why the Ministry of Sarrow Education has committed high schools to a marketing campaign in the sciences of the engineer.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a lot of reforms in the general schools," said a port-word of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government has introduced all the federal state of comparison tests.
In order to start learning early, the last year of creek is exempt of law - a model that of some other feeded states also involved.
Only future comparison studies can be shown whether the performance of students will be improved sustainable.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the risk quantity was reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, Sarre has not been improved as much as other federated states.
The bavaroes get better out.
And at the largest of the serois, the knowledge in foreign languages are not measured by the PISA studies - it would be possible to win points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is obligative in schools - even if the seroises are not French.
Can not open message
In Venezuela, the monsters will immediately make tic-tack except in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will remontate a half-hour time in South America.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain between time.
As the Office Journal of Venezuela communicated it, on the fact of a new law, the monsters will be regulated at least four hours and half of the universal time.
In this way, South America's country has a timery floor that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The Anti-American Chávez justified his position between others by the fact that the United States would impose the separation of the hours in full hours.
Moreover, Chavez announced Mercedes (local time) to stop relationships with the neighbor country, Colombia, about the fact of a case of bottoms.
The left nationalist announced that as the Alvaro Uribe conservator would be President of Colombia, he would not interfere with relations or with the head of State, nor with the Colombia Government.
"I can't, only because of my dignity," said Chavez, who has a constitutional reform on which the towns of the petrolier country should vote by the way of the wednesday referendum.
With this reform, he would be sensitively strengthening his power in the country.
The declaring element of this discussion was the decision of Uribe to remove the mandate of negotiations on the liberation of bottoms with marxists in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crashed on the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized on Sunday Chavez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all the mouths.
A new portable phone sonnery makes wrath in the country: "Why don't you shut up" (for you don't touch) is the phrase that over half million people have downloaded on the Internet.
She was announced by the king of Spanish Juan Carlos who, at the late time, was energed by the constante interpellations of the left people and said to him to be silent.
In 2007, Germany is a lot of salaries.
Although the strong conjoncture, according to a prognosis, a real less value of the salary threats the German soldiers this year.
Experts have quoted all kinds of reasons to explain their prognosis.
According to a calculation of Hans-Böckler funding, the salaries should be expected in 2007 to a real reduction on their payment fish in relation to the previous year.
"The failure returns to the low development of payments, to increase the Tax on the added value and to the mounting prices of food and energy products," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomic and research on conjoncture, in the "Image".
New charges may also be involved in assessment security for the salary.
The Ministry of Finances Peer Steinbrück said to the Journal "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the low of the assessment of 3,3 per cent for the new year was certain and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the National Agency for Employment has no longer the right to find in the areas to ask the Federation of Credits or Financial Aid, according to the words of the SPD policy.
We found that the explosion of food and hydrocarbures had increased inflation levels at its highest level since 13 years.
In total, the prices increased 3,0 per cent of one year to another.
Venus is the hell of the earth.
Despite his hostile atmosphere in life, Venus seems to be more like the earth that believed until now: the European Spatical dream "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind tours to the poles, like those who appear in winter on Earth.
From nearly three decades, scientists suppose that there are lights on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" branch today has proved - she detected electromagnetic vineyards at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus claim at a height of about 56 miles of cloud, reported Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the glorious theory of Cyprus, the lighters would have made the life on Earth: the hour would stimulate reactions in the oceans that have led to the training of amineous acids, the rock of life's angle.
This is not the case about Venus: "If there was alive, it must have been at a very old date of the history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
The atmosphere is nearly 100 times more deep than on Earth, sometimes the temperatures of 500 degrees are reigned.
"Venus may be the hell of the earth, but she remains a smoke," said Russell.
Why Venus, which looks like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been broken by a different development, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The department of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the advance research, since there was no longer along with the exploitation of this planet since 40 ten years.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results presented in several "Nature" articles are not only underlined by Venus’s singularity within the sun system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbour planet are more than the first.
So the researchers found, outside the wind tourbillons already known in the north pool, a cloud tourbillon on the south, which still turns faster.
The phenomenon reminds the air curtains in the earthly hemispheres in hiver, a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Spacial Astrofysica and Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the sun system has nearly the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 miles, almost so large.
The quality planet of the star of the evening or the morning turn around the sun in all 225 days.
However, she turns easierly to herself: a day comes for 243 terrible days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 Celsius and a 92 bar pressure, does not remember healthy the Earth, the scientists suggest that the two planets are constituted in similar conditions.
On both, the water was acquired and remained on the earth under the ocean form, but it was lost in the area of Venus.
And when the carbon dioxide was fixed on Earth as a form of carbonate, he is the largest part of the atmosphere.
Elders defend Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the will of the Parties on the accommodation of Dalai Lama at Chancellerie.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of availability attack after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler supports the appearance of Germany and summons the great coalition of closing the wish on the accusation of Dalai Lama.
"We don't have to present the outside world a nation divided on this question," said Kihler to the Trade Blatt.
Parallelly, Kuhler showed the understanding of Dalai Lama's accommodation by Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have a universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures," says Kohler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in the foreign policy, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended the Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new policy of China.
German chance has not taken its distances with the traditional policy of a single China.
"The Chinese knows it too," said the Keller.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had noticed directly about Dalai Lama's accommodation and had been attacked outside the CDU ranges.
Steinmeier was clearly clearly of the CCD's "foreign policy" policy.
After Dalai Lama's accommodation at Chancellerie, virus irritations made themselves feeling in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese Government recommended not only the Ministry of German Finances Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to the information of Spiegel, the dialogue also described on the policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the two countries.
The head of the Government of China Wen Jiabao requires then of the German chance Angela Merkel to recognize that Dalai-Lama's accusation was a mistake.
China refuses that European political men receive the spiritual head of Tibet in its official functions, Wen Jiabao also supported the Chinese position.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama showed that he tried to separate from China the Tibet and other Tibetian regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schuble keeps against the emergency as the French.
Road fights with the police, shoes, fire cars: Wolfgang Schüuble is guarding against the emergency as the French.
Everything must be implemented in order that the social inmates in Germany should not be exclaimed in the streets by violence, requested the Ministry of the German Internal Internal.
Barricades burning, cassors who carried on the police with chass fuses: after the severe young men in France, the Ministry of the Interior German Wolfgang Schüuble (CDU) feared a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive is not also in our home and disasters in violence.
We have to take this to seriously," he said to the "New Presse" from Hanovre.
All young individuals would not have come out with the quick changes of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the Commons had already worked closely to reduce the problems, said Schuble.
This would not only touch the integration of immigrants.
"For the integration summits to the islam conferences, this shows its first success."
But it would be too early for a warning end.
Schuble is noted at the same time as in German banks, there is no social problems or the view of urbanism as in France.
In the Parisean agglomerations of the north, young people were delivered to serious travel battles with the police during the last night.
Toulouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Increasing integration of the German government, the President of Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Account of emergencies in France, Kolat warned the "imitiative effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be explosive only in France.
However, it would have been a need to act.
Kolat accents the fact that the quota of coolers in young people below 25 years of immigration would be greater than the average.
It would have to ensure more places for training.
Kolat insisted: "We have to give you young people a perspective."
However, the President of Turkish communities added that a social control in families had more place in Germany than in France.
Many young ones of the immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we must even be careful."
It should be "with giving young people the opportunity to participate in the work and training."
By waiting, in the Parisn Faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything was very quiet for the night.
Police units were located, a helicopter rounded the area with projectors.
The post authorities have been part of three arrests, and some of the cars and pockets.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces ensures the calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, the Ministry of the Inner Ministry Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit from Faubourg.
On March night, nearly 80 cops were wounded in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the next night, the problems were going to Toulouse.
The emergency claimed after a circulation accident in which two young people had lost the Sunday life.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police is not responsible for the death of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The input in the opportunity shows that coalition has finished with the fund - and that there is nothing more to wait for it.
In what country lives this opportunity to the righteous?
After its disastering intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, it must be said: not here - in the country that should finally be ruled by it.
The reproach of too much focusing on the policy was replaced by Angela Merkel of a hard and presumed phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and she just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made all visible in what point this approach was exactly.
There were no specific interests or feelings health for the problems of the country to feel.
Instead, Angela appeared as a cloud: a politician who was in the foreign policy and who even remained nearby.
For example, climate protection: in this matter, she welcomes and yet on the Santandam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even, the ellogue of self-- have also been a little modest, the chief of the CDU would have refused it for two years ago.
Now she's cramped with all the facts, that growth would touch people.
In this way she destroys her image of pragmatist, which results all the problems instead of embelling the world.
But in the empire of Angela's cloud, internal policy problems are marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and worries of low workers?
He remains a few accessible phrase for this.
In this matter it is reflecting the number of times when it makes lapses when it is a family place.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a precise half.
She's titubing on the unknown terrain, from the time it's going to be concrete.
The Branch Attaque
In the debate of Youtube of Republican candidates to the President, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are in a serious crime war - and now they must be afraid of an outside candidate.
The tension of candidates is already on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandesters", noted Mitt Romney to his adversarie Rudy Giuliani.
This is against his side by severe reproaches: "I'd say that his own house was a holiday for clandestins" answered Giuliani and turned close to the ancient governor of Massachusetts that he had employed immigrants without papers.
Canadians are attached to the attack: As the Republic base has no official favors, the eight candidates to the President serve the CNN debates before to discreet their adversaries.
The Amateur films of 30 seconds that Internet users have sent through Youtube are worse than sufferers.
"It's with this kind of isolationism we left Hitler to come to the power," launch John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the road to call an immediate Iraq.
Romney also makes the lection courageously by Vietnam's veteranists, when he refuses to condemn as a torture that is called "Waterboarding", a method of intergovernmental method where it simulates the noyade.
However, the fact that the important teams of the campaign have gone between the time behind the war in Iraq and the discussions on torture are seen in the reactions of St. Petersburg in Florida's common room.
If the conservative values be held or the future heights of imposition are refused, the approvals are deferred in the auditory.
It is that it appears again when the weaknesses of the two favorites reside.
"I have made a mistake at that time," explains Romney intrigue and presents his excuses on the basis and the public TV to have been still a party of the apartment in 1994.
Giuliani, in contrast, passes in a counseling neighborhood when we ask him his opinion on literal Bible interpretations.
Musharraf is reign for the first time in civil.
One day after his retreat as the chief of the army, the Pakistan's power Musharraf was invested as President.
So eight years of domination by the army ends.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested for a new mandate of five years.
The Pakistan TV has directly transmitted the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf sweared to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
Mercredi had transmitted his charge to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani, and he was so raised to international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after his capture of power by a push without blood exposure, the old general will now reign for the first time as a citizen state captain.
With this reserve of the commander's head of army forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the urgency state that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
At least after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of urgency, according to the General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and so he will fill another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had been occupied after the establishment of urgent state with jurisdictions of his rangs, had rejected the last week all the reviews against the controverse reception of the state head on 6 October.
Five soldiers were killed in the north tribale region in the North Waziristan in a care against a military conviction, and four other wounds.
According to the indications of the Army's port, a bomb was explored in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are back.
The supergroups of Germany of the sixty-year years rejoice: the three members of the Harmonia group have reached their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more known in the foreign.
The proceeded feeling resulted afterwards in the form of three masters announced at the night's view.
Everybody has his little box before him, his cabin, and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63 years, throne in the middle of a white chemistry as snow.
It is flanched on the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old, and has a portable computer and a guitar.
Right, observed throughout the auditory, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, runs on his console.
Everyone contributes to the dream, among others even a Beat.
And sometimes this is r by inavertance to a traditional music trace.
It doesn't seem to be too excited by the masters themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has ensure some emotions between Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to devote him here: targeted supply indicates that the name is, of course, reasonably, in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way so sustainable that this group also misss so painfully since 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living leaders of the sixty-years?
Moreover than the name "Krautrock" is always more in England and America than in the origin country.
When the music industry decreased Echo price to the survivors of Cologne Can Group for their work in 2003, it was seen in the room the pop-man-survey faces in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegian area, the surprise had no longer limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother sat on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as a old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transformation in the unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has existed only two years and only during that period, the impact power that has been repeated was very lower than what has been assigned to him by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promiser name of Cluster.
We first played in the balls below the Berlinois scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subventioned by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly broken in Kroftwork and finally made a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time maybe the Germanest racial group.
In 1973, Rother, however, followed Cluster's musicians in the Weserbergland Forests.
There, in an ancient wall of Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities escaped the city.
Ideologically that in the Commune I community, where Roedellius had the right to turn as a nurse.
Place a artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
Soi-disting was found in the pool a fanion of Harmonia Ottenstein carrier and also a name for the art.
A lot of harmony is far away from the cell.
The first album is called "Music von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because also serious and modectic that sounded music, the group would suffer material misure.
The collection of the dead tree was not only serving him to look for himself.
The CD "Live 1974" who came to appear was recorded in a concert in Greece before a public record of about 50 heads, and someone thinks to remember.
Rother was emerged at that time when he wanted to force Harmonia to travel time in time.
It was a immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announces its separation in 1975.
Rother aires in the spheres of the isoterism and ensures his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzzen" (in flams).
Cluster reanimed in the twenty-five years and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We need the Live album of Greesem in Herbert Grejenemeyer.
His label Grönland has established the purpose to maintain Krautrock as a German contribution to the contemporary music.
Neu! has already been disappeared in this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia is in the world's culture house in Berlin.
Publicly subventioned in the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor, Dr. Motte.
In which the total of the fluctuation margin of the influence of Krautrock would be considered in the future pop music.
The place left by the group will be compiled by Harmonia.
The word of Brian Eno plans in the middle of single sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing manufacturers with Harmonia in the room of the wall.
The projections of other in black and white photos of cutting tools are served in the training of the league.
Before, the three veterans are again occupied to improve.
But more in collecting microphones to the orge and battery, to shoot the inough sound instruments through self-building instruments.
Today, the electronic music looks like the electronic music.
The three in the large technical figs.
In this even the house's worms will change nothing.
Under Barbara Morgenster's direction, we are all smoking and smoking under the sound cloud, and we sing a good moment "Aaaaaaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never did a Rock.
Rains were searched less in blues than in music conservations (Can), in technologies (Krootwork) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who crys "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also will not leave himself now to be disappointed by this soon.
But whatever you're going will be covered minutely on the scene.
Where's the music beginning and where is it ending?
This can take place on the nerves of someone (?) or make a good way of escape moments of great joy.
Richard Gere isn't just enough cynic.
With the "The Hunting Party" and "Merry Peace", two films approach the battle of Balkans again.
But they don't convince.
The projects have too much regarding action and switching shoes or, in contrast, are too lame.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: Certainly, Karadzic and Mladic criminals are always hidden in the Balkans mountains, but it is just there, in the most luxury country of the Bosnia war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We lost the most beautiful man in the 1940s, because too much of good and foolish roles in women's feelings and many too much press conferences on the subject of the buddhism raised him to show himself.
Today, Richard Gere is immediately the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the chairman becomes the chair (Why should the films of today be so long and confused as collective conventions of location drivers?)
He offers a wonderful representation full of eye clinics: at the end, his personality of reporter of war Simon Hunt is what Gere could be, if the destination and the industry of films were not so welcome: a man who had his best moments from long time behind him, but he, even as a monument in ruining his decline, kept the visible rest of his old charm.
But in the meantime, "The Hunting Party" continued together with the German production "Merry Peace", which also goes out this week, the infinitely infinite films rated on the Balkans War.
The film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serve of the Cosovars Français Français, in which one of the two is still closely loved.
Although he has been welcomed that the Serbs are not present for one time as the only causes of all the bad, this movie is so nice that a telefilm loses very quickly in action and insensed shoes.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without authorised but with a war at the place.
In contrast, we can examine in the perfect example of the Hunting Party, why at the top there's never a real film on the Balkans War.
The history of the three American war reporters, which are condicioned to pick up the high war criminal "nearer", could be, with another realisator and another scenario (all two times Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the story seems to be amazing: two men are going into a small team in the forest, to fulfill something that military can't do and for both men, it becomes a travel in the field.
One of the reasons that the Hunting Party misses is that we don't just let Simon Hunt be the desert cynical of a heart, as we are present at the beginning.
No, the script must apply to him to override a romantic avenue with a Bosnia killed afterward.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the range of the last five minutes, through a accelerated procedure, is that the OTAN, the CIA and all the world's price chassers have not succeeded in five years: to attack the war criminal and to leave it to a just winning to the Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime against Cinematographic Logic should be introduced.
In this case, the film has a very deep human concern.
He wants to declare that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suffers the Americans and French (in this case they must be exceptionally agreed) to not lead the challenge a lot of intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good intention and the wicked are this time so similar that a beautiful poem of Brecht comes to the idea.
He speaks about a mask of a Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatent, I see the branches of the front, clearly: as it's amazing to be bad."
The films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such youth heads, but they instruct what point it is fatting to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large flowers.
We can add: there's never been a good film on South Africa.
What is going on every time: when a star travels on a crisis family or on a mines field, then it goes something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still too close in time.
Whatever, decades are always past before Hollywood can turn a good film on the hotel with "The Shindler List".
Some films must still have to meet - those who today value classic works on the Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated in any case as the leaders of work.
But maybe we know today too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this rates to the scenarios the missing scrupules they need to tell beautiful storys.
"Be or not" or "the dictator" have become so good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know what the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe he doesn't want to be good when we want to make good films.
Perhaps we must have the scarcastic artificial and distance of the Romancian Lawrence Norfolk.
When we asked him about the parallel between his historic "Dictionnaire of Lemprière" and the Balkans War, he answered, "It's only at the fact that some things never change."
"The large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be killed in a terrible way and the war will always reign in Yougoslavia."
From Beust collects the criticism for annulation of Olympiades.
The recruitment of the wedding with the candidate of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of Eternity has been inclined in political and economics to critical viral viruses.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games on the water border.
But Von Beust calls the realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, main director of Hamburg's trade room, described mercredi a resort as a "false for local economy".
At the last time, no other project had developed so much motivation forces in the city but the idea of Olympiades.
"Besides this objective, the sport policy could not be maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senat to not enter the project, but to find a new point of department to longer, "which takes a second changed agenda."
The Master Ole von Beust was married at his previous statements, according to which the olympical ambitions of Hamburg were unrerealised at least to the year 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides a candidate for Olympiades, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," said from Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He returns to the concluded decision of the Sport Federation, on the candidate of Munich for Hiver games in 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the time we were provided until 2028 until there, we have no chance."
However, the dream is not permanently at the past, but Von Beust said.
The Sport Federation of Hamburg (HSB) regulated Beust's statements.
This would be given that Hamburg does not want to put his candidate for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close a opportunity to enter the projects now," said the President of HSB Gutter Ploß.
An abandon of the candidate would be more contradiction with the statements of the head of Senat at the time of the plenary meeting of the German Federation of the high schools of the sport.
At the same time, Von Beust would qualify the candidate of Hamburg to the University of 2015 as "not replace" to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Sport High School Federation was first in the past weeks called Hamburg as a candidate town.
The SPD Fraction of the Mair has invited the Senat to not use this precious time in the construction of residences in Hamburg.
"The Development of the Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senat for years because he played the map of Olympiades and excluded the building of habitations," said the delegated of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook a plan integrated in Olympiades and a sustainable use of residences, the CDU would have put exclusively on the "factor event".
The candidate for the Olympic Games in 2012 would have a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' boxes.
He who rejects the Sweden concepts and falls in woods, thinks Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or do you?
In this time, boxes made in Sweden lead shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
A large part of the twenty-10 Brillo-Boxs of "Stockholm type" listed there are contrafaces.
After the Swedish "Expressen" report, there are some months ago, the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of 1968 of Andy Warhol, the internal research in the Stockholm Moderna Museum has now come to a dissensor result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose ancient director of Pontus Hulten made a gift in 1995 in the Moderna Museum, are copies - and a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Tpey Stockholm", which run on the international market of the art.
Ancient story is filled, an enhancement of artistic and medicine products.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" boxes in piece trees, based on the red-blank-blank design of the science cards in puzzle "Brillo".
An exposition of his work in the Moderna Museum presented in 1968 - with Warhol Agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of carton: these were not (for financial reasons) of Warhol, but they were directly delivered from the Carton Cartonnage Fabric.
It wasn't here of art works, but instead of their models, exposition examples.
At the same time, Warhol had well given the authorisation in 1968 to produce a few boxes in Brillo trees in Sweden, which were not explanated in the Moderna Museum.
The witnesses of the time are today talking about about 15 boxes in wood boxs that at the time would be right in the story of art and entire, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the Stockholm Type.
Some of them have reached more than 1000,000 dollars in sales.
The problem was then that the Leader of the Musée Pontus Hultén had suggested, wrongly, after about hundred boxes were produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, Warhol would then cede him.
In fact, the 105 Hulten boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 only for a exhibition to St-Peterburg.
At that date, Warhol was already dead since three years.
Lars Byström, maintainer of the Moderna Museum, examined, near the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Sweden private collections, among which two were confected in Stockholm in 1968: their strategy panels were first printed and puncted, then we applied with a pink of the white oil.
The texture of copies from 1990 declares that the peinture has been directly applied without ground layers on the structured panels, using a peinture role - in addition it is not a peinture for oil, but a acrylic.
"This box was not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxs of Andy Warhol," let the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nitve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentiation Board's in New York is not a different decision, the Moderna Museet will class the six boxes in his collection as copies/material of exposition."
At July, the Authentication Board has well heard that he would investigate the "which accusations" that will be taken in the case of science boxes in pudding.
But since we're out there with an unexhortable silence.
Rebellious soldiers depart from Manille
In the Philippines, the rebellious soldiers leave, the same who were rent into a hotel in Manille, and who had requested the reserve of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The chief Antonio Trillanes, who rejoiced to the President the corruption and the electoral fraud, said to reporters in the hotel that he could not answer any blood exfusion.
The faithful soldiers in the power had little before the hotel was taken by the lacrymogene gas.
The twelve soldiers were cut off from a few hours in the building.
At least half of them were married before the courts because of a missing push trial in 2003 - between them Trillanes.
He benefits the audience to immediately exclude with about 30 sympathistics.
The military police, who were normally to watch them, appeared to be desolate in his favor and were joined to his mutinea.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and requested the retreat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal teams in power cover the sector around the respective hotel.
The President invites a urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Advisory for Security Norberto Gonzales condemns the action of soldiers.
"The people have enough," says Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the electoral unit of Scouts Rangers, declared that other army units would be shortly wanted to join the road.
The critics of the regime were called to a great demonstration against the mercredi President.
His government is running for months through corruption reproaches.
Manille's financial quarter was already the teater of the municipality at about 200 members of the Army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection was broken nearly 24 hours after the refusal of the army to be joined.
Since 1986, there have already been at least seven tentatives of push against election governments democraticly to the Philippines.
The United Internet becomes a major actor of Versatel.
The United Internet has seen a participation of more than 20% of the Versatel telecommunication company.
The average price by action is 14,46 euros, as it communicated to the mercredian society.
Only 20,05 per cent of social capital would be detened.
We've already been spent on a racket before.
The option would be open to increase the participation in Versatel.
With this step, we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German market of the DSL, communicated by the United Internet.
Just before, the proposals had already been made about an entry after the Berenberg bank has increased its participation to the Düsseldorf network operator of 5% to 15,1%.
The credit institution would decline the money only for a third party, telling it on the market.
The veil, the United Internet has already acquired a participation of about 10% in Drillish mobile telephone company.
In the framework of a capital growth, Drillisch placed in Bourse 17.4 million new actions of a value of 106.4 million euros.
The United Internet buyed 5,15 million for 31,1 million euros.
Furthermore, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation on the marketing of DSL products and mobile phones.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained an United Internet port.
The two companies found the MSP partnership to abhorre the Freenet competition.
For this time, both society want to be satisfied by their participation of 10 per cent in Freenet, and not to use their right to get 18.49 per cent additional in Freenet, trusted the United Jewish Internet.
However, both society would have left all open options, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet SA, have learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had finished at mid- October.
The poker is still hardly prevented on Freenet that is a part of the consolidation of the German market of telecomms.
Freenet had at the end of the third trimester 2,9 million customers linked by a mobile telephone contract and 1,27 million DSL clients and complete subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch had a direct participation in Freenet 6,01 per cent.
It was therefore agreed that Drillisch would bring about about four percent additional.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company was already decided in August.
