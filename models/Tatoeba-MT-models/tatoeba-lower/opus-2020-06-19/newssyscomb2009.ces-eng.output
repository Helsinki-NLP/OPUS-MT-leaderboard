Triumf of the right populations in Rakousca, there are 29 per cent
The citative exchange of both parties of a large coal and expressed sentence of the right popular parties, according to the first proposed results of an interim parliamentary election in Rakous.
Especially strong losses have suffered Rakous Human Side (PEVP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is really explored.
Furthermore, the electionary Leader of Svazu for the future of Rakouska (BZÖ), the Cortain Leader Jörg Haider has triumphal return to the global policy.
According to the previous results, the most strongest part of the social democracy country (SPE) with 29,8 per cent of votes, against the last choice of 2006 loss 5,5 per cent of votes.
Anyway, the OVP has been over 25.6 per cent of votes.
These are the worst results of these two largest parties in the Rakia Military History and, especially, people who have chosen previous elections, a perfect katastrophical result.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP went out of the coalyce, people had a significant smoke in preferences before the SPE.
However, the volunteers were obviously suffered because they left the government to lose.
In the first reactions on the results, the specialization of the potential reviews of the President of the parties and the advanced Vice-Center Wilhelm Molterer.
The judges are observed that it might be already in the lunch at the outstanding meeting of the Chairman's parties.
This development, of course, would facilitate the way to still the most probable outputs from the election result, so to renew a large SPE and EVP coalyce.
In view of the transmission of both right popular parties, the FPÖ has obtained preceding 18 per cent and 11 per cent of votes, but social democracies also expressed fears from the reaction of 1999 when people have agreed with the population (the FPÖ was still one, from the BZO in 2005) to a common government who has even called sank from the European Union.
In this development, Haider, which has already stated that it is ready to cooperate with any side and provides to return to Vienna to the Community policy.
The Green Party has arrived to the Parliament, but it has lost easily and has fallen between the Rakia political parties with the third to the fifth place.
No of the other parts of the four-procent border has been achieved, and it has not been achieved to the Parliament.
Blackzenberg: Whistles with India can be swallowed
If there was no problem to resolve the Chess scientists who were invited to the unlawful collection of broadcasts in India, there would be, according to the Czech Ministry of the Republic of Karla Schwarzenberg, a certain disorder of chess-Indian relations.
The Ministry brought this to New York after his Indian Province of Pranab Mukherdji.
"If it wasn't resolved, then yes, then it would come to a certain threat," he constated after the meeting that had been done from the Czech initiative.
The murderer after the action said that in court cases, it could be hard to achieve it.
However, in the case of Peter's Sweden, who was excused for a trial and a torturant trial, the Central Government may act with the local government in Dardwicking, where the jurisdiction is falling.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emila Kučara, which was judged for three years to prison, would be the best of the Mukherdji to call to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for a department on the chair and for the judgment to wait for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was likely expressed.
"Reports the call to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to forsake him," said the chief director of the Czech diplomate.
The only way he can enter the Chess side is to provide the "competent legal support", he introduced the Indian Ministry.
He also said that such a help has already given them the Indian side.
"We have the highest interest to maintain India's best relations with long-year tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," he said to Schwarzenberg.
In addition, as the CCTK said, his partner stated that the Czech Republic attached the problem of the Chess enthomologists a great importance.
"We are really thinking of a deep loss of prison and excusation of those Chinese scientists," he reported.
The answer to the question, whether the Minister had received from the Indian side of the promise of things to take place, was exhausted.
"I have already received a lot of promises," he just constated.
Chechen judges the fight on the sea day
It will be approached to the virtual electronic map on which Australia is considered and the close sea area.
However, it doesn't care about the continent, but the small point is lost in the blue ocean.
"The island is Australia and with him and the near sea day.
The area is therefore great as a single continent," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a thirty-year-old team of the United Nations Division for the interests of the ocean and marine law.
His boss, Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Vaclav Mikulka, looks and sometimes completes.
It's the power of work and supervision here.
The sea day still hides a little known world, rich on natural sources.
There can be found food, red and other unfair surveys, but also unknown living organisms that have no key to exemption the medicine against the race.
A day greater than a continent
The Great States have now started to reach a new submarin territory.
According to the United Nations Agreements, they use their rights on which agreed in 1982 in Montgolia Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly about the area of the continent animal, which often gets to a few hundred miles from the border of the country.
This has an exclusive adoption on all the sources of the continent animal.
"Unitedly, for the continent animals, the part of the sea day and its grounds are naturally continuing the continent under the sea.
It's for the border of the border, often as for the border of two hundred miles of sea, etc. the exclusive economic areas," explains Mikulka.
The request provided for by the Commission for the extent of the continent animal border shall be added to the content of scientific documentation based on many cost research and measures.
It's the result of a number of years of prepared work.
"The one of our tasks is to provide the Commission a legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has also submitted five requests, and it is Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three recent countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
The world's egg recently recorded the successs of Australia, which, as first, expanded its submarine maintainment.
He also received New Zealand - the rate of the sea day which the Commission accepted to him last week is almost 1,6 million miles of four-quarters, so it is six times greater than the size of the state.
Two countries invested millions of dollars to the investigation.
The smoking that will spread to them in the future from the use of the sea day will be unvaluable as they promise.
His requests shall also provide other Member States.
They can do that until ten years since they ratified the "Convention of Montgo Bay".
Where the continent animal ends, the area of the ocean day begins, the agreement of the "the community inheritance of mankind".
There is no State there any exceptional position.
The right difficulties in this area makes the agreement established by the international institution.
"The sea day but no Klondajk," says Mr. Mikulka, "the only regions are clearly limited and their mode is condemned."
Chess in the Pacific
The part of the sea day today is also the Czech Republic.
They are working on them with other States of the East Blog in the framework of the "Interoceanmetal".
This has received in 1991 in accordance with the agreement, as well as investors of several other countries, the status of "private investors".
He has the right to use in the ClarionClipperton area in the Tichem ocean, leaving between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
Investment in the research area is something greater than the old Czech Slovakia.
It's a member there, it's about the combustible of Tater's submarine replica.
"You can use the entire range of 75,000 miles of fourth.
The area is a rich finding polymetal concretes containing nickles, mix, cobalt and manan," indicates another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employer's division Rober Sandev brings one such concretion.
Remembers a little barbour or or, at a few fantasy, a famous shoe that lived according to the legends of Golema.
German units of special arrangement were released by hands
The Egyptian government requested the crisis with the hands of help from Germany - experts came.
When the situation was exposed, the special units were prepared, however, did not have been prepared.
In the public, there are further details of the areas of liberation of 11 in Egypt of unresolved European tourists.
For safeguard actions, according to the data of the Ministry's defence and inside, the German special forces were inadequate.
According to the statement of the Ministry, as well as the experts of society army, as well as the members of the German police of the GSG9, the years of social police, the Community Criminal Agency, and also experts on logistics from the Technical Aid Services (Technisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to the next report of both speakers of the Ministry of the Sunday Monday, German forces were not required, because the officers left their prisoners to go and urge when they recognized the marks of violent freedom.
The Egyptian Government of the Germany offered aid accepted as a supportable force for actions on the place.
"In that luck hasn't happened," said one of the speakers of the community ministers inside.
The executives took a group of travellers based on five Germans, five Italians, one Romania and the eight of their Egyptian eunuchs on the south of Egypt.
After the assembly in the wilderness areas in the south of Egypt, they moved the hands in the border territory between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the customers remained in the last time, as well as the details of the delivery or the possible expenditure.
Currently, savings are all right in Kahira.
Minister Steinmeier said that the freedom of the hands is in German ambassades.
He didn't get out to the detail.
In Berlin, there is no information available when saving returns to Germany.
According to the "Image" list, all five tourists should also have a special person to leave one of the German Airbus airports and to Germany to get outside.
American Representatives rejected the saving package
The first community of the United States Congress has laid a large majority to fall a safe for financial market package for $700 billion.
Index Down Jones was strongly disappeared.
In 206 to 227 votes, the American Snimovna Representatives rejected Government Safety Package for Financial Market.
Although all the calls of the President George W. Bushe and the Board policies were made for the programme that should mix chaos on financial markets, she was not found most of them.
The dramatic actions were fully tried to overcome the 700 billion billion billion billion billion critics.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic exhibitors, called before the messenger's voting to vote the approval, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for something that has not yet been done," he recognized.
During the vote, the Down Jones Index has fallen over six percent, or over 600 points.
It was because of the investors that the State Safety Package could lose.
Short before the end of the vote, the index value was carried out so that after the notification of the crashing of the package would be struggled again.
The experts are now counting other serious turbulencies on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, it is required to agree the Representatives and the Senat.
The officers shall notify the increased number of reserves
It seems that it's going to be smoking for German business in the travel move:
According to one study, the reserve of the next month has increased in comparison with the previous year - in the range of range even more than 30 per cent.
The low economic growth remains the poverty of Germans to walk unexpected.
In the reserve of the fields, the travel officers signed the increase of refugees in 31 per cent of the same period of the lone year, as in Berlin on Monday, Germany Reisverband (DrV).
According to the investigation of the GfK Market Research Institute, it is already available for the past months for the increased number of reservations.
The draft was thus according to the DDRV expression in comparison with 2007 to the 11% above.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers which determines data on reservations from 1200 German travel officers and interpols them on the total market.
In this result, the reserve of the income was held until the end of August 2008.
Because of the low dollar currency, the DRV is required in particular to the United States, he carried the DRV.
In these ways, it makes a reserve of a third party.
In addition, in Germany, the objectives of Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly required by the purposes of Spain, Turkey and Greece.
The first organizated challenges are in the course, reported by the President Klaus Laepple.
With regard to the comprehensive energy and food costs here are the costs "committed for the client than for individually organized licence".
Laepple explained that the money can be used otherwise to explore the use of sleep for the current reserve or all-including menus.
Even in the months of the year, the number of reserves was very good, so in comparison with the previous year, it will be resigned a higher reputation, even though, according to another study of Germans, who have undertaken a path, in comparison with the previous year.
My first October
Perfectly recognized pigs, drinks of tubs and prominents in steps from known proposers.
First on the pig.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have a common power.
She's a blond, a TV moderator, and he's put into a smooth step.
I have dark hairs, I'm a student and my clothes are out of second hand.
One thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the pick-up, and the photographers are already on us, and we're fully full of memory cards -- I'm living, because I'm first at Octoberfetus.
That's how you can be friends.
It seems that my lonely step has fulfilled his goal.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north from the steel round, so my feeling was at least limited.
But immediately after the Heresienwise arrives, it's better than it seemed.
If anyone has a female step or a sweet calhotes; no one looks disturbing or driving - everything is absolutely normal.
Specific views in the tent with the banks in the chocolate are just my shooter.
One Mnichobank advertises me that I was wrong to say, "You're free, in the middle of the lady, on the right hand, the back of the light."
They're able to shoot the bottom left.
"All right," he says, and weeping.
Others with subtiltic flirtable technology do not stay so much and they have easy-played clouds with the title "This drink is get dressed!" and strike on the rounding hairs.
A young man with such exhibitionist shoes is named Bob, he's from England and at Octoberfest first comes.
He looks like "gorgeous" with the "hoo".
It's gonna tell me after he's lying about the pitch.
Now, next to one of those hydrogens, everyone thinks that it's a disaster.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as in Bavorsca he says to publicity freely powerful people.
Others are happy to save this way of alcohol.
Eight nights run by the desktop where Octerfest ends, hopely healthers who have to be able to be able to be able to be attached to the fear of pickers.
Healthers are always shown in the chains - in four nose covered weight from the status to the status.
They function as many visitors: empty there, full of returns.
Whoever sits under the board of this rabbit is not to see.
"It's only those who can't continue," he calls me in response to my question, one of the healthers and loss the damage.
The police published the name of the victim of an accident.
It was published by the name of threescore women who died in the hospital after Essex shot her car in Essex.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on the Friday afternoon, Carol Paulson was on the secret Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After accident, a 1160-year-old man was arrested for surveys on an invisible vehicle.
He's already released in the police office.
Turkish diplomatic views are expanded
A long time before Turkey started trying to enter into the European Union, the European powers used to go deeply into the Turkey border.
On the east side of Bospora, maybe only twenty steps in Asia, are one of the best memory of this unseen imperial ambassador.
Hydarpaša was proposed to two German architectures Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neorenian Service.
Then they'll tell you the tourist leader.
The building sits around at the end of the training with the rings on each round of the rounds, in view of non-rounding from any provincial German Council.
The hair's smoking.
The entire structure will be slowly disappeared.
But as a man gets inside the stripped bags, he can't have any doubt about the size of the business that the west door was.
The states in August 1908 opened the German consortium of Anatolysco-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, who was entered to the Imperial Game later, had to be in mind to control the nearest east, to perform through this ferry that had to go to Damascus, Bagdad, and continued in the area that is today Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambassadors were gathered in the first world war.
Their rows were attacked by Lawrenc with the Arabic and his unjust units.
Relative isolation from the areas, exceeding the grounds of the bound war, is gone
British and colonial units went out of Egypt and spread Turkeys and their German associations from Palestinian and Syria.
And for the Hydarpash station, the wrong reports have come.
In 1917 he destroyed the explosion of the municipal skin of her processed throat.
Turkish resources say it's about sabotage.
Since that time, the storys are walking through it.
However, this gate to Antolia today and continues to east - at least symbols - to exceed the extent of the Turkish diplomats.
The Governing Page of Justice and Development - ACP - has created a full new field policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the fields of the areas, exceeding broken borders of war, is gone.
Now the new policy is applied - Turkey is angry.
It is noted that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Siria, Palestinian fractions Hammas and Fatahem, Iraq and Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on the night floor in the Turkish main city of Ankara, where I had to meet one of the previous ACP experts at the foreign policy, the Turkish sentence of Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and half hours later - after codging ships after codified ships, which remembered the old-spits of the New E-mail document, I came to the Turkish metropole, designed as a new city for the collector State, who wants to turn back to their otoman age.
However, AKP with its well known islamic roots represents a paradigma of the Turkish consensus paradigma.
In the west, she resurrected a suspect, especially in Washington.
Taxik brought me to the main AKP, ultramoderal stone and cooking building, intendedly on developing businesses, increasingly rolled in half of trade houses and trades in the power where the central managers in trade rooms - men and women - to make a crazy business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central policy of almost every other European political parties.
Sako, cravate, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The goal of the foreign policy of the parties is to reintegrate Turkey in his nearest area.
The student war was anonymous," he said.
Turkish was separated from his finger.
Today, we have to look at the east and the west.
There was no choice.
They had to do both of them.
"Maybe it'll come a minute," I asked, "When will Turkey be going to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "You didn't worry to get this decision."
Afterward, he showed that almost all of those who I spoke here, said at least to remember: Turkey relations not only with the nearest east, but also with the Cauca and the Black Sea are the same way to use Europe and the United States as Turkish.
With Turkish on the palm seems that Europe can, metaforically say, go after the east to Asia and the nearest east.
Return to Hydarpaš Station, after the next majority of the night, I thought about the two German fronts Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who were looking for how this building was established for hundred years ago.
As they were surprised if they would find that the European emotions on the nearest east may now be, from the main part, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting for the traject of return through Bospor, I remembered that Turkey was called "A sick man of Europe in those days."
So it seems that at least then there was no much ideas that the continent would have to have a fascinating country.
Memory life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: As Guildford's music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nexrolog, September 11) was at the time of Guildford Philharmonic orchester and congregation.
As a part of the period of music plan, a year was based on the great joint congregation of Proteus.
He had to be 21 years, but when Proteus was last in 1979, some of us were at least 30 - just refused to reach the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (Mythological Municipality) represented the eye and the ability of the congregation to leave in any music that was presented to him - to madrigal or Messiaen, to be self-sufficient or all orchestrem.
The musical approval created by such a young congregation was often a terrible, always exciting, and all of this through the inspiration of the only man and the supervision of music that remained immediately unchanged for the whole time.
How often Todd just told us that we're gonna let the music talk for themselves.
He said, "The trainer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it! "
His tattoo technology was absolutely clear and precise, but it was not diktatory nor month.
It's already a musical standard wherever he's still invited him.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If some director had to be passed on the rhythm, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when Guildford's Philharomin from 1962 to 1982.
For the last 40 years I reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honorly say that I have never been disappointed - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal depression.
He hates the directors who, according to his words, just "the one or two pecks in the world."
It's gonna miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your neurologist William Woodruff (this 25th September) says that "In 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher on Houble-Norman... and he studied BSc, MA and PhD."
This comes from Woodruff's notes of the author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not exact.
Since 1946 to 1953, he taught the economic history of the University in Nottingham, and at that time he made a disarmament work on the British guarantee industry that led Professor J. D. Chambers, and then delivered it in 1958 as a publication of the British Guarren industry.
Really he tried 1950-51 in America as a researcher on Houble-Norman and 1952 at Illinoiske, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
He doesn't know why Woodruff passed this part of his carriers.

The second Honda's tracking his bestseller
In November, Honda starts to sell the second generation of Jazz model.
If the leader of this single space vehicle already has already provided a significant space, he is now offered more space interieur.
In this case, improved engines that increase the comfort of vehicles and allow more packaging.
Evolution is less than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the new Jazz's lines are very similar to the previous model, this single space car has become a lot of changes.
It must be mentioned, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger sizes and new engines.
Before we examine a new model, it is necessary to note that the new Jazz comes to the market six years after the first generation.
So the first thing we consider is that Honda needed to limit this model more shorter than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, the other markets have been sold in a phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold but in 2002, and also during the aeroplane 2008.
Just in Japan, Hondy Jazz on the market was sold at least a million kitchens.
The second market became an older continent with a half-mill-mills sold costs for six years.
However, Honda has a goal to increase the new Jazz sale in his category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold totally 83,000 Hondy Jazz, in 2009, 100 000 car cars, which would be significant to increase in 17 % on the European market.
In the case of the Spanish market, Honduras sold all 8,000 jazz models from 2002, which means 6,7% of the total Honda sales in Spain.
If it goes about a new generation of Jazzu, the ruling of the Spanish pool is expected to sell 2 000 bucks per year.
Just the arrival of the New Jazz, Honda allows explicitly to reduce the smoking of sells in Spain.
The vehicle driver so expects the end of the year with a total number of 22,000 sold costs, which means about 4 000 less than in 2007 and 16 %.
Honda also increased its share in the Spanish market at 1,8 %, exceeding 1,6% from the lone year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to get 2 %.
To make Honda get this part, it is achieved by the success of his new model.
It is Honda Insight, a 5-year-old hybrid compact size with a length of 4,37 meters, from which Japan's company promises the global sale at about 200 000 kits each year.
In the case of market, the Japanese manufacturer sold 50 % of Insight in the United States, while the remaining percentage is divided by an old continent and Japan.
The launch of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of the next year when it will be presented in January in Valencie.
In contrast to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased all sizes.
His length was increased to 3,9 meters (5 centimeters more), width to 1,69 meters (to two centimeters more), and broadcast to 2.5 meters, which means the length of 5 centimeters.
The height has not changed and is still 1,52 meters.
The increase of the dimensions has also been increased in the internal space.
However, these costs were achieved by use of new platforms, however, with the saving of pills in the middle of the car which was already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
In the same way, the weight of the range, which provides the system of two days, has increased to 399 litres, about 19 litres more than he has made the rate of the range in the first generation.
It is necessary to note that these dimensions are provided in version 1.4 of the engine, because the range of the invasion space in Hondy Jazz 1.2 makes 379 litres.
Another perfection except external elements - such as the low LED light or the possibility of saving a simple panorama board - is easier to access the back-site.
The doors leading to the second line of seats allow the angle of opening 80 degrees in contrast 67 at the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz is new and engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two benzin engines 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both engines use the i-VTEC technology that allows low consumption, lower oxyde emission of carbon and brings an exciting improvement of the steel system, as well as with a high-to-tail moment in the full range of the motor demand.
The first motor of 1,2 litre has 90 horses at 6 000 questions with the point 114 Nm at 4 900 questions.
This engine - which had been in the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has consumption of 5,3 litres and emissions 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine, which was 83 horses in the previous generation, will now get 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combinated consumption of 5,4 litres and emissions 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto Cell" takes the shoes
To progress in the development of protecting technologies against disagreements, Nissan inspired this time in nature, particularly at the day.
This Japanese company created a work that takes for a plane of treatment evening, and then he takes the shoes.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the technologies of the prevention of the smoking.
Ingegners Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. The robot developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in scientific-technology research in Japan's Tokyo University.
According to Kazuhira Doie, the General Director of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Development of Tags, BR23C is represented as the extension of four areas of the Nissan Security Square.
Robot has to fix the capacity of prevention of the train at the cars of this tag.
In the air, each room creates its own personal white ground space, which seems very like the Nissan's safe bed.
The most important is, however, the grounds of the eyes that are able to see in all directions increasingly than 300 degrees, which also allows to fly in its personal space without stop.
Ingegners in the creation of this visual function proposed the name of the laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
This indicates the transactions that are located until the distance of two metres within 180 °C before BR23C, calculates the distance of the given object and sends the signal of the mixed microprocessor, which will immediately transmit it to warning before the crowd.
"In the moment that the override is marked, the robot will improve the movement and immediately change the direction of the rotation of the col into the right or greater angle to cut off the shirt.
The most largest difference to make any existing system is the fact that all powerful manufacturers are very instinct.
If not, the robot would not be able to react enough quickly to get out of the surface," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobil Laborator and the main engineer of this project.
The robot can't be moved on the top and bottom, its move is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction that is allowed by the ring of his hair, however, in the infinite quantity of directions and possibilities as the ring.
Nissan therefore, except the acceleration and delay, also used the rotation function to deal with the robot.
"The equipment requires only each couple of the following, and in accordance with these datas, it is necessary to be maintained.
It does not require to maintain information or logical intuitions from the previous manufacturers, thanks to which it can work without interrupting with the two sticks of the memory.
Maybe it's surprising you, but we're not talking about gig or my."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies of a timely prevention of the smoking, technology, where Nissan prevents use in series of cars for ten years.
Robot uses lithy polymer battery that are easier and keeps longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible use of this technology could be build units into the GPS satellite navigation system that would bring the driver to the target and then disappeared.
Use fear before you take a hypothesis
It is necessary to recognize that the Ministry of the United States' Finance, except that he has sufficient capital for injection, does not have any deficit.
The face in the face of the crisis, and to protect the Americans to take risk hypotheses in the bank with a serious solvency, was created on the Internet popular-learning game "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Free Faith Hotels" or a robbery hotel.
The hotel and, in particular, his receipt appears to be humble to a man one, two times and three times think whether the right moment is to ask a trust.
And especially where to ask what is probably her purpose.
The fact is that the game contains useful information even if you don't have the detailed.
It's a page that's likely for a young man than a whole public space.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, the room of dreams appears.
At least something, because they don't like to talk about buying the house...
Morgan Stanley opens his MUFG Captain
The bank house Morgan Stanley reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japan's bank, which gives nine billion dollars to get 21% from his capital.
Weekly after they declined their previous agreement, both banks explained that MUFG agreed to buy 9,9 % of the Morgan Stanley regular actions for a single price of $25,25, which represents the total rate of three billion dollars.
The monetary price is lower than the account value of the price papers until 31 August.
The MUFG bank invests more than six billion dollars to reach conversionable price papers, which will ensure 10% of the cost and the changed price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley claimed that the whole operation was entirely achieved by the average price of 29 dollars, e.g. 28 per cent under its current cost.

However, the speaking group refused to provide information on the strategic projects of both new partners.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley would have been able to pay payment of Tier One approximately 15 %, so one of the best in the sector.

Letters - Still most cultural resources
The Debatte on the Finance of Culture is the full-page of new ball titles and is the subject that is just a pre-selectable campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to spend the poor sums offered to small museums, archives, archeological extracts and national memorable places that lose hungers?
What policy will be able to remember the federal government to forget their memories and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we have no laws that would actually protect our cultural inheritance?
Did you know that the French government takes three and a half million € to restore the only shutting of Chinon in Loiry field?
In our American seats, it is written in the state that the protection of the cultural inheritance is part of the American culture and that this inheritance must be protected to all the citizens, all elections and national organizations, and it is in fact.
In Quebec, in the Federal Society for Quebec history, it encourages at least 40,000 friends associated with 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genealogies on the discovery of history, maintaining groups of private archives and the protection of archaeological residences for several detailed.
Sometimes are just the companies of our famous dogs who are unexpected to protest when promotors and leaders cut their buldozers on old stones and forgotten graves.
When are we finally waiting for story and memory?
Governments of Benelux's State part of Fortis Bank
The states of Benelux help the Belgian-Holand Bank Fortis, which, as first in Europe, has received difficulties because of the impact of the American hypothesis market, party amounts: Three countries support money and ensure facilities, which also have a capital participation in Hungary, a number of 11,2 billion euros.
This week has agreed on the highest level of Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland Government to participate in the President of the European Central Bank and the European Communities for the Economic Court.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area, which, in the framework of the crisis of international financial markets, broadcast in the forests for a year, has been achieved into a great crisis, and the decision made in this matter may be considered as a certain view before.
In the meaning of the decision born on weekly, all three States will buy at least half (49 per cent) of the bank's owner.
The Bank, in particular, sold parts of its capital participation, especially then - mainly the assessment - activity sold in a lonely year from the Netherlands Bank Amro.
The Fortis bank actions started talking for the past week, in the second half of the weeks, the critical characters have already appeared in the situation.
However, the analysis agreed that with their 85 thousand employees the bank is too big for them to reduce it.
The price papers of the company have fallen only at the fifth of 12 percent, at the minimum 14 years.
From January, the value of action is more than two thirds.
In view of the current prices of action, the total market capital value of the group moves around 14 billion euros, however, according to the representatives of the company, it is not real.
The officers are ultimately committed from the fall of Fortis's action on the sea market related to the acceptance of the American package plan for 700 billion dollars.
At the Sunday, the actions have been deeply stealed.
The new general director Philippi Dierckx was named in the bank's chair.
The money staff also looked for private buys, however, with a serious offer, nobody had yet been invited.
The Belgian Government has already announced that investors do not have to be afraid of their money.
The bank clients still haven't cut off the panic and the ships have not been carried out by the gate.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has a solitary town and has also built a few leasing firms.
Box in the corner
Life and health security in America on the basis of the data of people on the purchase of medicines often prevents the possibility of closer with the insurance agreement.
Detectives for data protection are afraid that the market with data will be uncontrolled.
"It is a data protection program that means the use of the data on the prescription of medicines in each case for the authorisation of a person concerned.
This must be in the hand of someone independent, otherwise we carry out a license," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the program designed to monitor the prescription of medicines.
Security company makes a safe and amounts exposed in the case of certain events related to the health situation of interests, and if the risk is determined as too large, the ensure will not be closed.
They were sent to medical research and closed the contract only when they knew their results.
10 years ago, Dick considered a lot more leading procedure: based on the identification number of the medicine to find how the medicine was buying for the last year and half, from which the program brings himself to the patient and his health status.
For example, if you are regularly buying a large number of medicines to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that he has practically uncontrolledly highly blood pressure, which will immediately attach him to the category with high risk.
In the meantime, there are a few versions of the programme, some are currently determined and risk coefficient, so it is certain that, except documentation, almost no work remains, although detailed difficulties rise.
In the absence, lectric medicines can also be used for some objectives, some are attached to migraine or horse, but they are efficiently also against depression.
They represent a significant risk factor in the view of trade ensure that the first named difficulties are not.
For the purpose of the request and processing of data, a special company was created before the doctor had received the necessary information was requested by the patient of authorisation.
This is now the officer's officers, which must not be attached to their precautional disabilities.
Some companies in the last time have already processed the results of laboratory investigations relating to the data on the use of drugs, as well as to provide a more precise image of the health situation of patients.
In addition to the data, the control of their use is still more comprehensive.
There is a special law on health conditions, however, its efficiency is related only to providers of health services and security.
The proposal of a law that provides the authorities to control and specialized businesses to provide data is before the Congress.
Richard Dick recognizes that it is not enough: therefore, his program developed so that the data should be put to the expression agreement of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the relevant commitment can only be disappeared, otherwise, the confidential agreement will not be closed with him.
So the blinds are just on the boat of the good will.

Trosks were found on one river round in the sea height of three thousand meters, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, at the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human residence in the air.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, discovered the doubts that remained still: "Let's been found, we sent a team there and now we're sure that it's exactly one thing in which Steve Fossett flyed on the day when he lost," he said to one print conference.

Yesterday, still in California, far from the border with Nevada, some of the Fossetto's personal subjects were found at one of their nearby homes in Mamoth Lakes.
The two documents with the Fossett name, both delivered by the Illinois Federal Airport, the money in the preparation and one bundle.
The search of Fosset was interrupted a month after his dismission.
The billioner got a place in the history for a long privacy collection.
In 2002, in the sixth trial, it became the first man who finished the way around the world in the airball: two weeks of a solitary air.
Three years later, he traveled the world in the air and without access.
In the middle of his many records, there are also 15,445 meters, over Anda, even with a copylot.
Glk, you're not waiting for a reputation.
One unnormal Suv with original design and exactly determined lines, wide surfaces with exact rounds.
This is, at the short time, the lastborn Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the stars house, through which Mercedes-Benz tried to enter the faith of the news in this sector.
Just by his non-traditional processing, it will be expected and non-conventional and communication that brings Suv Glk on the market and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms since 17 October.
In this way, the reporting campaign that brings the debut of a new vehicle begins the non-official way of communication also by the futuristic platform campaigns in 3D, which is the first used in Italy for the autonome tag.
The project of the maxis of the plaquetes, held in three different phases, will dominate the main milan business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins with a car in a stereoscopic vision and with special branches distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv at least real dimensions and in a 3D format.
Actually, when you're looking at the image, you'll get the car out of the ball.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Elumina8, the new Glk will be lighted in various times in all its little ones, so that it will be made again in the only image.
Mercedes would like to try this reklame to bring something new in the stereotype area of automobile communication.
Will this happen to him in this way to build the interests of the future lawyers?
So we know who are Italians
From Triveneta, it risks Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 kids and holes for which Italia is now shooting? They are parts of the Ultras Italy group, which have seen the National Azurra, and that is, in truth, has never done problems.
She's never met with the fans of the antibody.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders are coming from Triveneta.
From Verony, Padovy, Terst and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact a few groups) were added to them from Campania and Puglie.
They have three-colored balls in which the cities of the origin participated: they have removed them on the evening to not be recognised.
They are inspired in English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found the right national fans, the Lewis.
Figc was available to the Italian fans 144 inputs: all in name, so easily controlable.
And Viminale was actually controlled: among those who went to Sofia, no one with the Dads, no one would have been prohibited to visit the stations.
Four blue fanses who had previous travels from the station were denied and denied the income.
Now Viminale waits for reading the reports from the Bulgarian police, then makes measures: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the fans who were arrested or to those who were identified during the exposure.
The International Daspa, which allows to visit not only Italian station, but also in Europe.
Our poor, short, isn't going any more to one station.
Good luck.
However, now there is fear of emulation: it means that more than hundred and fifty are added to them.
"We have to smoke this fire and not justify those who are in this way," confirms Viminal.
So, "All right open eyes, especially because of the national smoking in the middle of Leech."
It's just in Puglia. It's a small nuclear of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio, in the academic Casms, which can also count on one part of Aise, is dealt with a secret service that is just about the problems on stakeholders.
"The Board Leader of the Officer and the shipping in Mameli's hymne?
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilliho (in fact a little happy way), which is a few weeks from Director Viminal Osservatoria (the place that was Francesca Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzie before).
Mazzilli was a quarter in Tertu, where Ultras supporters of Italy founded in 2002.
It's true as Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but, of course, that the conduct of these 150-200 fans will be able to be.
"I'm not sociologist - adds the Osservatory unit - crimes are attached to the land where they were.
This group remained in the areas, and now we are looking at what happened and assessment for the future.
But we're talking about the stars at Mameli's hymn: it's not a crime, but if you allow it, it's unconsciousness."
