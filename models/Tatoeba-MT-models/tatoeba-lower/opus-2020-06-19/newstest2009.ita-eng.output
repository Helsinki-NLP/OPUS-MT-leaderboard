Prague's bottle at the closed market has had a negative crowl.
After the role of the morning, Praga's Borsa has restored the losses.
The transactions of the CEZ actions have almost the half of the current trade.
Finally, from the beginning of March, the Prague Borsa rejected the role of the day before he was almost 6%.
After this bottom, there's the crowd of actions in Wall Street.
Thus, we also show a reaction of the market to the result of the voting of the Chamber of representatives in America, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the local financial sector.
Action role in Asia
Wednesday the actions of the Asian Borse have lived a dramatic crowl, even though the indexes, during the day, have successfully removed a part of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong's Borsa for the day was almost 4%, but then one of the losses set up at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese actions to the Hong Kong Borsa, was disappeared from 3,8% while the markets were closed in Shangai.
The actions at Sydney's Borsa were lost more than 5%, but at the end losses were at 4,3%.
The Tay-Wan Borsa, according to the local index, was disappeared from 3,6%.
"The saving action planning is uncertain and it will influence the financial markets in the world," observed the head of the Valute office of Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, at least part of China, is the financial policy only, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has a tariff of interest at the same level of the United States.
The American legislators, according to the first Australian Kevin Rudd, should rapidly return to the dialogue and apply the proposal for financial support.
In other cases, there is the risk that other countries also reach the consequences.
United States Action Straight
The American Parliament Monday refused the support plan of the financial system, for which they should be estimated 700 billion dollars (except 12 billion of Czech corners).
The legislators have so ignored the call of President Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of financial crisis and would help to stabilize all the economy.
The United States Actions of Monday have lived a straight and the main instructions of action have registered the largest role of more than a 20th century.
The Down Jones index was cut off at about 7% and a role of similar sizes was observed last time in 1987.
The index was already cut down before voting, but as soon as he saw the law design was not approved, he went into a free fall.
The Congress has disappeared: the Government of the United States can elargue 700 billion dollars to banks.
The most highest representatives of the American Congress and the Government of the President George W. Bush have agreed on a larger way of the economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on the matter will be at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the Safety Plan under form of economic assistance for the American financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (core 12 billion of coron).
But it's not yet detailed.
The representatives of the Congress should therefore define some details of the input before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The financial system's support plan will be discussed on the territory of the Representative Chamber.
Wednesday told the Agency Reuters, the President of the Committee for Banking and Financial Services of Barney Frank's room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could be voted on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that will be the first and fundamental psychological factors to reveal financial markets should be the first and fundamental factors.
However, successfully, it will be returned to the reality because of the compliance of mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of markets will be achieved.
Paulson: the Piano must be effective
"We've done a big step forward."
"We have explained our different opinions on the form of the presentation of the package for the stabilization of the market," announced the Nancy Pelosi Democratic to the Bloomberg agent.
According to the same , the final vote may still come to the Sunday.
The delegates of lawers have been gathered on the night between the Sabbath and the Sunday with the American Financial Minister Henry Paulson, to give the financial funds of the Government.
These funds should be served to buy from financial companies the non-cedable hypothesis goods, which bring the financial companies to serious losses and risk the stability of the whole system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to bring the review plan still, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
The Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is strongly raised on the markets of actions that are brutally crossing.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are so trying to achieve a definitive agreement to the Congress before the Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before the trade on Asian financial markets, which are, in terms of time, the first to influence the Monday market after the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two American Congress rooms will vote the law and even if negotiations can be arrested at the last time on some problems.
Legislators hope that it will be approved in the next days.
But the law will still make a lot of changes.
The total sum of the system support should be divided in two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be at the same time as President George Bush asked.
However, the Congress can block the rest of the sum in the case of the “impression that the programme does not implement its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the ends of 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in negotiations.
Even if the President can put the vote on this decision, the Congress may overcome its right of vote.
Instead of these changes, the basic thinking of the programme has been maintained, it means to get the financials to buy passive hypothesis values, which price is crossed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their hypothecs.
"We've done everything.
The room of representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and the Monday Senat," as the Republic Senator mentioned.
The progress of the negotiations is also satisfied by the President Bush.
His portion Tony Fratto stated that Bush is satisfied by the positive agenda of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to establish our financial markets and to protect our economy."
Restriction of gold paracadutes
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the main portfolio, said that the legislators have agreed to the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of the contributors from losses, the closed budget of reductions, the fractioning of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit gold paracadues for companies who participate in the programme and creates a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Financial Ministry.
"We have worked very hardly and have done a great step to the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan takes account of the assistance to the owners of the households who have problems on payments.
The Government should negotiate the new rates of the hypothecs that will comply with the objective of cutting the monthly expenditure on the rate for the debtors and allows them to have their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economo of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realisation will be very difficult.
"It's because we don't know how and for what price the problems will be buyed.
This will be determined for how the losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," said Marek this week for the iHNed.cz site.
If the plan is now approved or at the beginning of the next week is not, in Marek, so fundamental.
"More important, it is that the representatives of the Congress have already found a agreement on support of this plan and that they baptize it before possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is in this most important moment, "he sublined Marek.
Dual to the last blood: MP3 readers against cells
We'll advise how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
This is clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
However, there are many reasons for the search of a self-name reader.
The choice depends on the use and the requirements of the future owner.
Perhaps you're hard to buy a high-quality coast to listen to the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Instead of these musical products are not excluded as LP and from the quality point that there is no objective reason.
But if on your scaffles you're able to smooth hard-rock, jazz or blues likely, a giradiski of the genius as a minimum dream you dream it.
Likewise, it works with the portable music, that is compacted or simplely in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories here.
For some can be inacceptable to spend for a 8 miles of coron reader, such as a fan of Pink Floyd may be hardly differed by twenty corners of the market.
Two streams between which are enough space for all.
The choice is large.
To decide is the time of battery.
Some high quality music readers can do much more than just read music, but they do not even for wrong phones.
There is no other current universal equipment as well as the cellular.
In accordance with the primary functions, call and send sms, you can read music and video, record both and have a photo machine, sometimes better, and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take care of smartphones and palms, you'll also have a computer in the mini.
It's a small miracle that no frigorifer can make the grid and no television can photograph anything.
The University of the phone also brings disagreements.
More functions you are used on the cell and first the screen indicator will require caricabatteria.
And reading music uses a lot of power.
A few cells can read music for more than 12 hours, sophistically, and very less.
In this sense musical readers (in particular the most simple) are much more efficient.
As regards economic cells, you don't know that they can stay for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from when some calls, look for safe to another caricabatteria, that is also for the most costest devices.
But you won't have this problem with a MP3 reader, even the worst will lead to at least 9 hours at functionality continue with a rich.
Another problem is present when the music is loaded in the cell.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices available from the Universal USB port and not all can connect to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only few memory readers are able to make it without adjustment for minicards that are not used in the cell phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (IPod), don't need any special software.
It's enough to fill the device with the USB music from the computer.
Most of the telephones and readers are created by only a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the interprets, the name of the album, kind or according to the classification of the user.
Some devices play only the tree of folders, like the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, telephones can make more.
When you choose a special device concerned, especially the resistance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly of the use facility.
If the music serves you especially underground and if you listen to it every day just shortly on the tram, you're just a telephone that reads MP3.
This is now, clearly to any phone.
You don't have to do too much of the formats of the phone or the reader recognized.
MP3 readers all support them, the global majority of music that comes to you will be exactly in this format.
Furthermore, this format that is the most differences, the total majority of devices supports music in WMA format.
It is less than the AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best phones also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, through the mobile Internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service may already be a valid argument to buy a telephone reader.
Of course, the offer of operators is increasing and usually limits only at the time of the radio.
The prices are not very basic.
But generally it is supposed that this way of sale of music (as through GSM , Internet or without branch) will dominate musical industry in the future.
Most people always take the phone back.
Anyone wants to hear some fruit in the task while the MP3 reader is forgotten home.
However, it depends on this, if you always take the coffee or at least the auriculer without fishing.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers, has.
Maybe the biggest profit of the telephones will be, for many, the price.
The most economic costs usually less than 3000 corners.
For 3 and 4000 corners you already have a very decent walkman.
However, you will be limited from the ‘avoid of a income for common coffees.
The best telephones and from the most equipped technical view point and also with the arrest of 3,5 mm for common coffees, cost to 15 thousand coron.
Instead of the benefit of readers is, besides others, easy manageability.
The most simplerly not needed more economic (see our choice) does it really makes anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of manageability is a time with the common stereo or maybe the giradischi, is obviously.
There is no danger to urge for wrong the launch of the mobile Internet network and therefore a giant ballet for the transmission of data.
What device to take
The most economic cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) are normally a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD etc.).
In the case of the ‘acquist of the card’, you will enter into 2 000 corners.
But watch attention
Basic models support only the cards with the maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only those most costs do it also with the memory cards of 8 GB.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy a little MP3 reader, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1100 corners.
If you are part of the most required listers, you prefer to take the specialized cells - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the comfort of the service so close to the same MP3 reader.
In this field he made more ways Sony Ericsson, which mobiles of the walkman line have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
MP3 writers of the marks above indicated are ensuring the same service and the same price category to 4 000 coron, but with a larger memory capacity (before 16 GB) and the resistence of the battery (common 15 hours, in line of maximum to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Perhaps
Maybe the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is enough maturity and our operators are practically offering all services as their partners in West Europe.
However, it does not have anything — a virtual operator that obligates the traditional price to cut off.
Maybe it's not for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators are the most dearest in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobile.cz.
At the end of the accounts, the CTU confirmed it, which noted that the price of the SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming tarifs, maybe a paradoxal situation will be created - for some Chess mobile operators, the SMS will cost less than outside than home.
How can the prices in the Czech Republic be maintained so high in respect of the ‘Europe’?
The answer is simple, missing the competition that would really want to start the meeting .
Maybe a safe sound, even there we have three mobile networks and covering highly over 100%.
Instead of mobile telophone operators, the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, Paul Dvorzyak also enfaces the Board of the Council of Czech Telecommunications (CHTU) , which, in sometimes, expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network has no longer many possibilities. (The rest may be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there's another chance to be the virtual operator.
In fact, the income on the market of virtual operators has brought a significant extent of prices, to which traditional operators should be reacted.
Contemporaryly before the entrance of skills such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, there were votes like us in Great Britain.
However, it was shown that the place for operators of the genius is there and that they can really have success.
In the end of the accounts for examples, we don't have to go very far.
In February this year, we have informed you about the arrival of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only half years this operator has been able to conquire more than 100 thousand clients and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, after Mobilking, the Penta financial group in the Czech Republic is between the ‘U:fon’.
The advantage of virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a very concrete group.
To work effectively, it's so much less clients than a traditional operator.
They are not driving behind, of course, relatively high expenditure for creation, functioning and maintenance of mobile networks.
So in the world, virtual operators are usually low costs, they offer calls and SMS a little price, which often is balanced with the offer of the most restricted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Gran Bretagna offers SMS that cost as a minimum half respect to its competitors.
But as shows the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can be a very good move even the scommits on a group not a little.
This operator points to say specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator who loves you and you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if you can also say a concept like in Poland.
The portfolio for Vodafone Miroslav Čepisch is doubtless: "The Czech market is relatively small for a broken approach, on which most of the virtual operators are based on.
In addition, from the view of the services is relatively sacred."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, the operators of the mobile network
But it seems almost sure that if there's no operator in the Czech Republic, it's not the Mobiliking.
"There are talking about the extension of this success project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not many expectations.
Mobilking's access will be in the other countries of our area," says in a phone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the printing of the Penta financial group.
So he confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favorable to this thinking.
In contrast, they are trying to do everything because you don't believe any competitive potential.
Since a long time, it does not hide its interest for the start of a virtual operator, the new GTS group who would like to do so another step to become a real competitive telephone O2 in the field of business clients.
"We have a great interest to offer our clients not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunication.
And first it's better.
We have discussed again this opportunity with all the cheque operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says Paul Kaidl Group.
So maybe they'll get better time.
The not official information claims that the first virtual operator should have to have it within the end of the year.
But now, around its creation, there is an immense wall of silence.
"In this time we don't believe that in the Czech market there is the space for the creation of a virtual operator in full title.
The Czech market, in the absence of other markets, is very specific.
Finally, no subject with a complex and serious project has been returned to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srscheň of the O2 printing section.
In the specificity of the Czech market, the other operators also remembered.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemr's printing portfolio adds to a weird agreement with the O2: "Now we have not noticed any live and pregnant commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build."
And adds: "The T-Mobile network will hardly appear a virtual operator within the end of the year.
In this time, we have already had to have a specific agreement on the table, so that it would be possible to consider it at the ‘orizonate’.
Vodafone focuses on its attention at the achievement of its own requirements of licence 3G.
Add Miroslav Cepical: "We are open to the negotiations of virtual operators and, in particular, in the share of costs and infrastructures.
We consider this, from the view of customers, the most producer.
The main Vodafone strategy in this context is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile network."
The competent authorities - with comprehensive operators
The achievement of mobile phone operators can easily understand, the entrance of another operator would mean a growth of competition, would bring the prices to delay and to reduce the profit.
Why then facilitate the accession of such competitors?
Feeds around the U:fon creation prove that when operators have something they can reach from the same part.
Maybe the great pressure pressed against the CTU in the U:fon creation period to the T-Mobile company.
This proves public information to access from the CTU web pages.
But now U:fon serves as a argument for which you don't accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of the competition of the mobile phone market has been a little potential in addition to the ‘input of the fourth mobile operator in the market.
In relation to the typeology of the mobile market in the Republic of Czech, it is clear that the ‘introduction of another competitor would be on him and, in particular, on his high-private services.’
However, the ‘approval of mobile phone operators’ is very surprising the complete disagreement of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not only the ‘appearance of the CCTU, which is in the Czech Republic - a difference of Great Britain and of other developed countries - there is no competence to interfere in economic competition.
This is excluded to the office for the protection of the economic competition (UOHS).
However, this in contrast to all the problems has subjected its typical position.
"The introduction of the virtual operator on the mobile phone market would be possible after the concluding of the contract of the non-limitation of the necessary infrastructure between mobile operators and virtual operator.
No contract of the genre has been concluded even because the offer of the potential that is probably not enough interested for traditional operators," stated Christian Chalupa, a section for the UOHS external relations, in response to our question.
A such statement from the representatives of operators may not be surprised.
Instead of the office that must defend the interest of consumers and also take care of the fact that no one applys its position on the market is more than a delicate case.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the outside where virtual operators are commonly working, we can see that their income in the market has contributed to the absence of prices for mobile phone services."
But obviously, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the reduction of the prices are not the interests of UNOHS.
Really smoking in all the situation is the nearly emotional harmonization of these three operators from their reactions.
The question about whether it is really just a coincidence, it is only one.
Like the same ‘the same price of the benzine for all benzines’ is simply the fruit of the concurrency and competitive fight.
"The section has not found signs of anti-competitive conduct about this fact and therefore there is no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, therefore there is no more responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile network for virtual operators may also miss the telecommunication regulatory," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many contrast points .
Naturally, there is the analysis of the markets designed by CTU, according to which telecommunications are from the view of economic competition the only market.
On a kind market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always needed the agreement of the network exercise.
And the mobile operator has logically accounts – the monopolis of his network.
So for a certain part must be dominant by force.
But even if we don't accept this argument, the UOHS should be a minimum alert that three mobile operators are so strangely similar.
At the same time, the lamentations of the interesters (including the new GTS company) show that during negotiations with all operators, they are very similar.
Downloading the responsibility to CHTU in telecommunications is a very frequency track with which UNOHS is out of the whole factory.
We have already met it in some similar cases.
In fact, it has not been possible to promote the extension of the rights of the ITU on the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the law on recently approved telecommunications, although the fact that many experts expect the improvement of the situation.
This is the fact that the representatives of UNOHS should know it more than well, but maybe their interests are otherwise.
It can be done when no one looks
While we do not enhance the functioning of these viral pseudo-virtual operators, there are some additives in the Czech mobile networks.
It is about companies that publish their lists of prices of mobile phone services which are only partly published.
It is usually businesses that are busy of multilevel marketing.
So, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a series of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually reached only the providers.
The magic is the fact that the company in contrast of the operator appears as a classic company client, which orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important client then receives special prices offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators have a similar prevention.
"If the cases you speak, of which we are interested, you may be able to handle the violation of the contractual conditions, and you can focus on the conclusion of cooperation with this company," answered Martina Kemrová on the question.
But it's almost impossible that a kind of activity would not come to the ears of the responsible subjects of mobile phone operators.
Especially in cases of the three companies mentioned can be treated with thousands of customers.
No operator protects himself at the same time from an attraction of the genius.
From the activities of these companies, there is a unexpected benefit and at the same time - in different ways of real virtual operators - they are not hurt in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Cepical advertises on possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, only an uncertain percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered to their name, so they can not fully dispose of it as normal clients of mobile phone operators "
But exactly this should result a little strange to the CTU.
In addition, another question for UOHS is opened.
If mobile operators close the eye of the face to an attraction of the kind, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It’s necessary to add that UNOHS has sufficient powerful rights to discharge similar activities and if it does not want to agree the interpretation of operators who have no idea of everything and that their trade conditions lead to it.
When we're not more costs
As the text has already been mentioned more times, the input of virtual operators on the mobile phone market has brought a significant price exhaustion for services.
At the same time, practically in all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to stop their creation.
The arguments used were practically identical - marketed too small, at too sacred limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries, just in these cases, the regulatory bodies are involved, not mobile phone operators, but their clients.
Be with the formal measures or with the non-formal pressure, then he came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him others have been accepted.
Of course, the Czech Regulators are launched from one to another all the cases like a ball patate.
For our experience, we can't disgrace our feelings that the uncertainty of competences in these cases makes it more than I'm comforting.
But we don't get the spring.
If the information of the backscene is right and the virtual operator will actually appear from us, the checo market of the mobile phone will be returned in a motor.
If one of the operators had allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly UNOHS could remain insufficient to the reject (discrimination) of other interested persons.
And maybe we'll stop calling higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The New Inno Czech has four new versions.
Choose that best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Inno.
Sunday the first Mirek Topolánek at the opportunity of the Day of reconnaissance of the Czech State has presented the new registers of the national inno. "Where is my home?"
The new registration of the inno was made by the National Teatro Orchestra under the direction of Jiré Belohlavek.
There are four versions of disposition – so with the voice of man or female, core steps and structural building.
The song is under the direction of Katerina Künzinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the inno reviews are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krczek.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all and four versions.
Whitelavek considers the national song Chess one of the most beautiful others.
It's already said to the "Czech Space" radio that has chosen particularly to sing the variables to the same, the singers with the younger most representative votes, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to care that both of them and the core, they have the clear diction, that the text is very understandable, that they are in harmony."
Then the national end will fulfill the next year on 175^ anniversary.
The song "Where my house" was first sounded in 1834 on the ball of Stavovscheh divadlo in the ‘Orient Opera Fidlovačka of Josef Kaetan Tyl's music of Frantischek Schcropa.
He's buying the popolarity and people’s spontaneously made it.
The first stress of the song after the foundation of the Checoslave of 1918 became the natural part of the National End.
It’s remaining one of the seven national symbols even after the born of the Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" inno
The MHD MHD of Praga will take you first with an electronic tesser
March 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date in which in the metro, tram and bus will come up the first passors that at the place of the card will have an electronic tessera.
In this time you can look for her about hundreds of people who have their own Opencard treasure .
The passors can buy that from 30 and 90 days and year (which will be warned from the first January 2009) and at the same time will recharge their cards in the Infopoint and in the offices of the Compagnie of Transport and at the end of the metros of Museum, Möstek, Naddraje Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajska, Kačrov and Luka.
The taxis can be buyed from yesterday on the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service has approved more than four hundred clients before the afternoon.
Those who will begin to use the service through the Internet can completely forget the sports in the metro stop where they had to do long files for the cards.
The tagliant is buying through Internet and on Opencards gets it on one of the 12 offices of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, the passagers have a sport with personal format that will help those interested in the Internet acquisement and will also record their credit credits." said the draft of the project Martin Opatrny.
Except that in the libraries will be able to load electronic balances on opencards in bankmat and selfservice that are installed to the inputs of the metro.
How are these bankates?
They are red, they are similar to the formals of the bigliets and the passors have already noted them about the stop of the metro Roztyly, Budijovická, I. P. Paulva, Florenc and Vttavska.
"Now there are five in all the city, but within the end of the year they should be eighth," he concluded Opatrical.
The tagliant will be checked instead of the ‘author’ from the bankmat.
The bank service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard threshold and the previous payment of the tagling, it will be loaded above.
Electronic tissues are not only in the capital but also in its areas.
This is in the cities of trends and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the community of the Central Bohemia take to get the capital.
"No treasures added to the integrated transports of Praga are the municipal checkers of the card readers with which the temporary and local validity occurs," explained Philip’s control mode from the Ropid Organization, which sets up the time of the collective transports in Praga.
City buses have the readers of the integrated cards in the ‘author’ box.
During the word, it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the author, but more needs to add Opencard to a specific point near the box.
So the author checks the validity of the loaded carts.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded carriers, there is nothing easier to ask the author this type of information," added Drapal.
Travellers who take the town buss and don't remember, when it escapes the validity of the tagliant, can reach the self-service banks, where the cuttings are loaded on the card.
This will display information about the validity of their documents on the ‘applet’ screen.
The Southern Germans wanted a reference from the United States
The Southern Germans in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of the South Bohemia.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States patron.
With this desire, according to what it says, some Sweden German groups have been repeated in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This happens more than all of the letters stored in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Czech Krumlov ask in letter to the President of the United States to not reiterate the restitution of the "Sumava distretto" – employed by Hitler based on the Agreement of Monaco – a Cecoslovacchia.
"We have understood the situation, and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units are coming to the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as freezers," is written in the letter signed with the words "The people who are in the destination of Shumava with the whole heart."
Because they say, the Annex to Cecoslovacchia – knowing the Czech National character - gives the Germans of the Southern hope only to brutality, to miss regards, to the ‘incomprehension, to the slavery and to the slavery, the authors of the letter pray to the American President to assume the protector on Sumaba now and always.
"We can't believe that without the opinion of a fourth million d'habitants, you will recognize this territory as a stranger state to us, who violate and distract ethnic minorities and has not contributed for nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Alliates," wrote in the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign it is the fear of the seed of venture by the "Cache Oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt of the convince of the Germans of Shumava , it would be easy to organize a reference on the will of its residents to become part of the United States or to live under the standard of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem anguished with our knowledge of the history of after war, some witnesses describe appropriately the expectations of the Southern Germans.
Although the Germans had to at least conclude that they would be treated by their movement from the Republic, only few of them had accepted a type of possibility.
Some hope that the United States and the United Kingdom would negotiate a sort of autonomy for the South Populars.
Others believed that they would just stay in Cecoslovaquia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Budajovice.
He was mobilized during the war as German in Budajovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When the end of the war was captured by the British and set in prison fields in Holshstein , the decades of other German Germans went to find him so he taught him the cheque.
"They believed that when you came home, the cheque would make him comfort," said Chalupa.
No of the German prisoners, who lived in Cecoslovaquia pima of the war, according to him, said that on the basis of Benes' decrees would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the authors
The most precious action in the Czech history indirected to the road safety.
It is also possible to definite the emotional medium campaign, that the Ministry of Transports has the intention to make Mercedì.
The office of the Ministry Aleš Rhebičak, is expected that this scratches and leaders of a dangerous behavior to the flight.
The campaign from 150 million will appear in TV, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on volanties.
It should be smoking the authors from the fast guide and under the effect of the alcohol to the flying.
And remember him also to put the tape before he goes.
He wants to touch the conscience, especially the young authists, motorcyclists, pedons, and not for the last professional leaders.
What's going on in the spots?
Especially the story of people who will affect emotions.
And this also tests the "slogan" of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "not think" is written on the target.
And in a blood pool, there's the word "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The spots will "spaven" the spectaculars until 2010.
The Ministry has inspired such campaigns in England, where you can commonly see images with drastical scene of the victims of accidents.
It is so promised to delay the number of accidents and dead incidents on the Czech Streets.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Cartoon and bottle and leaders
"Authors works the cartoon and baston system.
The cartoon for them is, for example, when they pass with red and so they rescue time.
The baston is the risk of many or incidents.
You must remember the risk to leaders, " says the psychologist of the Minister of Transport Martin Korzán of the hospital Na Homolce.
So we want information campaigns in the pressure and especially negative publicity, believe psychological.
According to him, the panels that warn the authors of the danger are already less effective.
"If it has been installed the fixed panel that warns the danger, it probably will be quickly confronted with the environment and the guides will not take care of him, " warning Korean.
Olmert would approximately return all employed territory changes of peace
The first of the provisory Government of Israel, Eud Olmert, expressed for the restitution of practically all the occupied territories in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, Jerusalem east and the high places of Golan, instead of peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, Jediot Achronot.
"We have to come to a agreement with Palestinians, that means that it will be necessary to return almost all the areas (occupied), if not all of us," said Olmert to the day.
"We land a certain percentage of these territorys, but to Palestinians we should leave the same percentage (of the Israelites zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the ‘eventual restitution will also include Jerusalem est .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, does not want the russs or spiners to pass to him, as happened to one of my best friends, he must renew to a part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in the assembly at the two attacks of July in the city, while some people were killed and ten of those who were hurt.
According to the first, "a special solution for the Mount of the temple, the holy and historical places," which are within the Old City. . .
"He who wants to keep the Israelian sovereignty over all the city will be integrated 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also underlined.
Return from Golan high places
Olmert has also been proclaimed for the resort of Israel from Golan's high places, which is, according to him, the immediate condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I don't propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's retreat," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they're going to renew to get Golan's high places.
They must renew the current report with the ‘Iran’; they shall renew their relationship with the Hezbollah (moviment of the Sciites); they shall renew the permanent support, which offer the terrorism of Hammas, (moviment of scientists) of Al-Qaida (the terrorism network) and Jihad (the saint war) in Iraq," he needed the first.
Question after the ‘incident: are it illegal to steward in the bus?
The law doesn't recognize them, it can't walk on the ‘autobus that is traveling a long distance
In the context of the tragic accident, the Italian city of Padova of the pullman of the Student Agency company has come out of the question if stewards and passors can move to the border of the ‘autobus’ during the corse.
"If we want to respect the laws severely and formally, the steward's activities is in conflict with the law of the rural circulation," says the portfolio of the Minister of Transports Karel Hanzelka.
The 'incident of the past week, with which a 22-year-old hostes was caused by a car who cut the road to pullman.
The girl was sitting at that time near the ‘author’ on the less safe place of the pullman, while there were still two other places assigned.
But the ‘autobus’ can make a accident or breathe brutally in the time of coffee or journal distribution.
Depends if the ‘autobus’ is dumped or less than positions in feet according to the circulation book.
If it is not homologated, the travellers must be sitting.
Student Agency's buses have no feet, he confirmed it on the currentaln site. And the director of the District Radim Janczura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning has not allowed the movement of passors on the ‘autobus’.
After being revoked and we concluded that the passors can use the bathroom during the corse if they have the place assigned," he expressed his view point.
The law doesn't recognize steward.
"No clear legal interpretation of the role of steward – no law is concerned about the regulation of this role."
However, there is no regulation to the transporter to carry out the services.
The law of the street circulation recognizes only the term of the vehicle's composer, its rights and obligations are not defined," adds less clearly the Hanzelka portion.
However, the Director of the Department of the Road Circle Office of the Ministry of Transports Joseph Pokornou believes that the law is satisfied with this problem.
Depends if the bus has the positions in homologated feet.
It's all that," he says.
Categorize buses in towns where the positions are in feet and the maximum limited speed, interrupt with positions with higher speed and long-term speed without feeds with the maximum allowed speed and safe seats.
Like in air, the ‘expert’ says.
L’expert BESIP on travel safety Jaroslav Hořen does not find the fund problem in the movement of stewards at the border of the “buses.
"In a quiet course there are no many dangers, the situation can compare the air services.
It is not sure there even when a turbolicity comes, and the ‘flight assistant can cut off the head.’
"If the bus makes a broken brush, of course, the physical laws are eligible.
Like in the urban pullman or on the tram.
The transporter's tax should resolve the safety of steward with a internal Regulation," says and also means that the problem is not resolved by the law's view.
Janczura is ready to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers steward services..
This uses about two hundreds.
The Director does not even after the ‘incident’ belongs to their dangerous officers.
"Now I'll have the feeling that I have to consider the steward profession as dangerous work, I'll abhor it.
Travelers can get coffee and journals while they go.
They would also decrease the expenditure," says.
The Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a part of lines in respect of Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on its measures as a interest in security.
"We don't have hostes, we're on the end from the beginning.
First or then it'll end with a dead accident," he said less than a year fa Tiden.cz.
It’s happening a great tragedy.
In the ‘incident of the line for Napoli, a young hostess in Plzeň region, which had worked for the company two years.
A Slovakian car is probably gone out of the emergency corse without using the arrow and locked the road to pullman.
The leader of the pullman tried to avoid it with a brush hand, but he urged it with the previous part of the right.
Janczura refuses the fact that the two stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these places in the long treatment, they are insectable."
The dining is in mind to declare the ‘auteur of the car.
The Agency will not expect the court of the Court to pay the damage to the family of the girl, but it is expected to be a financial compensation from the crime.
Revision of the law?
Not View
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts of the Ministry of Transports for more than one year, may be carried out the movement of stewarts at the board of buses.
"But they haven't received any concrete results.
They do not consider them so much, they take more of the pointing system, the maximum speed on the ‘autostrade’ and the use of the telephone during the guidance,” says the 'expert Hořen.
"The Minister of Transport does not consider stewart's activities as a great threat for the safety of passors," concludes Havelka, that the control of the bus safety is the competence of police and officers for security.
Düsseldorf's hope point on Francoforte
They do not miss the talks in the letter of the Director of WestLB indirected to the home collaborators.
In the publiced letter of the Monday, it could be formed "the centre of the capital market of the financial group of repairs" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf bank institution with the Deka-Bank of Francoforte.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with sustainable benefits in such a company.
Moreover, all such units may be a decision-making spending for further leams in the banks of the countries.
So it is read, when an administration advice in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity of action.
Because the WestLB attack is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the Commission of the EU, but also through the National Agency for Financial Survey Service, having noted the Regional Government of Northern Renaissance - Vestfalia that the time is intended to search for a future solution.
The legamis between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Cases of Risparmio are already known because of their investment funds, and the WestLB is sure he's talking about about a very good time, even by Francoforte.
At the end of August, he reported the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the first half of the year that a housefusion was driving through Magonza with a national bank like Helaba or West LB does not mean.
However, the Deka Administration Advisory that by half is carried out from regional banks and from the consorcies of repair boxes, has delegated the advice of administration to conduct contacts with West LB on common contracts.
It may be treated with the negotiations of the market or parts of them.
However, the discussions have, as they say in the field of business, just at the beginning.
From Deka-Bank, with its 3000 collaborators is one of those who count more in the field of businesses in Francoforte, it is not the first time to consolidate the field of repair cases.
In 2003, for a short period, Deka-Bank seemed to be based on the regional bank of Renania-Palatinat and Helaba.
This association to three did nothing.
Although the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was contrary to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions also showed that it was impossible to achieve a agreement.
The Regional Bank of Renania-Palatinato went instead to the Regional Bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stoccarda.
However, they always have always thought about a Deka-Bank fusion with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl, President of the Council of Helaba, he expressed against projecting games to meet with his house.
In particular, it seems that you believe the recognition, which is necessary to close the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarese Parliament has passed, it may be a meeting of the Landesbank with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, it's not a good news about all.
If he increased pressure for other fuels, the partners will lose their hands.
In South, we would now be the junior partner, even though it has now overcome the financial crisis very better than households in Monaco and Stoccarda.
The association of the boxes of repairs Asia-Turingia participating with the 85% of Helaba has set the challenge to the meeting with WestLB.
It's only NorthLB
These geo-strategic reasons are only a account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different pharmacist models of individual houses are combined.
In June, Merl noted that the decision-making question, with which pharistic model the future of regional banks would be ensuring, would not be given any answer by the association of German repair cases.
At the end, it may also come out the Western LB division, which, naturally, is not desired.
So the letter of the advice of administration expresses the will of aspiration in any case to a "all general solution".
It will be seen how the reunification of the single parties will work with the Deka-Bank.
The second end of the weekend of the birra party is dedicated to the Italians
For Elena is the first time while for Luca is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a company, and so she says that everything is different.
Following them near the barile of 5l. of the Mark Kaiser is a barboot massive and shows about 200 travellers who are the deep sounds that can produce from the hair.
Elena before Luca's a path and after a bathroom.
They came from Bolóna to Verona.
From here at the parking of buss near the Porta New station, they go this evening to 23,45 four rooms with destination Monaco, Birra's feast, I'm here for 6:30 hours.
Three travels are mainly reserved to the Italians, in one other travel only Brazilians.
In an angle of the parking, South Americans are singing with the band in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so weird, says Marco, that it's not something for the Italians.
I marque that brings a long cappot with false film footer and a couple of eyes with silver wide shoes are the buss.
Since five years are going to Octoberfest, this year are three tours.
Last night, day to the party, return to 22.30.
Pernotater would believe only inutile expenditure, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the travel, the welcome of the brindisi with the Bear Kaiser, made according to the standards of bavarese, the case of disease and German guidance – Mark has frequencyed a German course in Francoforte.
And that's so night the buss are gone once the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
The silence falls in the bus, the travellers sleep.
Better so, they will still need their forces.
They're stopped in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian buss are on the A9 car street before Monaco make a short break.
When, as proposed, Marco's group arrived at 6.30 at the parking near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 buss from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathered together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First: put the yellow chapel.
On it to the left is written "Octoberfest" near the Internet address of the Marco Travel Agency: "Concersived.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer's tent means run!", said Mark first morning.
"Corre!" Run and buy up the grounds of the tent.
"Not before, we're not blocking, and not all the yellow bottles sitting on the same bottles, divide themselves in the active space!"
The mouth costs 8.25 Euro, Marco urla.
And don't forget to give the missing.
"We're going to deal to the security service, that we're doing good!
If you leave the places, they're scared!"
Third, "Start at 22,30 points, we'll meet again here!
He's gone for the party.
On the road one attacks as follows the yellow bottles to the trees, the carts of the streets and even to a public cartel of a large popular popular party.
He wants to be ready to battle the remote.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as "the end of the Italians."
The data are not existing, they are talking about 50 miles, who are going to travel the Alpis and invade the tenders, is supposed that 10% of the visitors come from Italy.
The Monaco police is strengthened with 7 High Adige agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarese Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where Italians result in the first place with 200 medical cares before English (aproximately 60 medical health) and Austrias (or 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the hofbreuhaus tendent.
1. Inson notes for the believers of the Hypo Real State
The German banking system is relatively stabil, he confirmed the Minister of the Financial Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the political has used the word "relative" and has also been attached, that the German bank sector is not reviewed by the critical developments.
Because the crisis has started the weekend.
The immobilier Hypo Real State financer, noted in DAX, has received from a consortion of German banks a billion credit, to protect its turbulency on markets.
A expert person of the situation said to Reuters on Monday, the support credits would be achieved to 35 billion euro.
The real State Hypo should only pay the interests for the requested part.
The money comes from private banks and public banks.
On the other hand, the loss of the Depfa affiliate.
The State Financial Management, according to a journal article, has been refunded in short terms – which is not more possible because of the disagreement on markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reserves were reduced from 95 per cent of 2,37 million euros, even the capital quote was decreased from 1,6 to 1,45.
Current payments and net rewards of financial affairs were falling to 0 in respect of the last year, increased uses or questions and certain actions as well as the liquidation of credit rates were cut down more than 70% over 5 million euros.
Only higher thanks to the restitution of subordinated compensation costs that are from the restructuring of the ex-group Depfa and from the refund of interest in accordance with the only text of credit laws and the management of businesses for business consorces, the negative benefit is sufficiently moderate with about 16%.
The ancient public financer after being privatized in 1990 was lost in the speculation with commercial immobilier credits, which were spoken in the Aareal Bank.
Since the payment in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has been committed more in infrastructure projects and financing common projects of private and state investors (PPPP) and has been developed internationally.
The real State Hypo must now admort the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental effect on the profit and loss of the group.
The fact is that the divisions have been deleted.
Yes, in 2007, it was reduced from 2/3.
The Real State Hypo after the Depfa assumption is a major financer of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the refinancing on the market between banks in contrast to other institutions, because there is no confidential deposits of customers.
Since the lock of the American investment bank of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the delivery of credits between banks in a large part has been exhausted because the banks accumulat the liquidity.
The Real State Hypo needs annually for a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 million. – shortly the refinance measures.
According to the advertising of Hypo Real State, the financial fabric of the group was covered by the credit for a certain period and the protection of the enterprise from the impact of the international monetary markets for the most unemployed.
From other sources, it feels that, thanks to the money, the refund is ensuring until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Commission on HRE Georg Funna said that the HRE group would not need a short time for monetary markets.
The Bundesbank and the National Entity for Financial Monitoring Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still ensuring.
This is hopeful for the assioners and the creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamic and improperability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the financing is not completely used.
But the contrary is not to exclude.
After the Sunday evening, the bank was learned to miss, the current saving could not be quiet.
IL cross axis cross 75% of its 3,30 euros.
They're gonna be good enough for mutual courses.
While the previous debts are nearly inamorable, the costs of posterified credits are delayed.
In particular, the mutuality of Württemberg-Hypo Württemberg is comprehensively comprehensively decorations with exceeding 2009.
Before the Mutues of Della HRE seemed to be a special investment, now their validity must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, which the crisis has been achieved by the Depfa's reach, should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Although central banks, governments and less worse banks are still ready, it can be accounted on an admortality within the term.
Or enter the function, what nobody desires to hope – that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed within the next 15 months.
However, regarding the information restricted because of partial statistics, the probability of almost certain has become a justified hope.
He will, in particular, create investors for a long term, some nights insomuch with the decision if they are divided from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the report of losses for future payments of the compensative tax on the majority.
Sylvana and Bento-Box secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of the school should be presented to Tachibana Highschool, girls start to ride: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-new New Change Log of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
I was emotionally emoticed.
I had fun to go to school.
Tokio's margins to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes with train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her alone, and I wasn't lost.
The beginning of the first lection hour seems not to be fixed as well as from us in Bassa Sassonia.
Students came a plan from the 8 at then, until 8.40 begins a short interview with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the lection started to touch me.
But I'm not the guy who speaks voluntarily before people, in addition to a class of 40 schools.
Because I wasn't yet the school uniform, I was put a old hospitable mom's room, together with a room, blue calcetons and black scarpe of coo.
So I was put before the catedra and I tried to say well, "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany and party between a week in my complementary year.
At that time, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have bisbiglied, ridiculated and done signs and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
This I already knew her from my Mangas.
It is the basic lessical of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I'm going quickly to my place.
The girl near me grew up, for her was a honour to sit near a switch
The rest of the lection hour was continued quietly, but when he sounded the egg, I was raised in the real meaning of the word.
All they were talking inordinately and ridicule and followed me with questions – then it is really difficult to understand the English of Japanese.
In the pause, everyone opened their Bento.
My hospital mother also made me the panierin for the Lunch- is different from the famous German pains.
I have resolved with speeds, salsicins, insalted of cetriol and algebra, fruit and a kind of involving involvings with flesh and tofu...
To say the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
The things seem strangers and have a completely new sample.
It's, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the boxes under the sale, brrr!
Bento is not only the Sunday to Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a well done by her, prepared enough artistically, with the hope then to make the knowledge of the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga fums.
I'm very interesting if you can find me.
"Why exactly Japan?" They asked me my friends when I told, that I would have been going for a year to school in Japan.
I always said,
'Cause I'm fascinating.'
Finally, I'm reading the Mangas for years.
And to understand the fumetes and cultures that contain, before or then, I started learning a little Japanese language.
I was totally convinced to come once.
I also fashioned traditions, uses and costumes.
They have a lot here.
From one part, Japan is a location of technologies and the last trends - in the opposite part: severe, disciplinated and traditional.
Because everything is organized well, I have never been lost, even if Tokio is the greatest city I have never seen in my life."
1. The reasons also have feelings
A rat or a crash runs when they hear the danger.
The neurologic scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: too many animals have feelings.
4. But how can you see if, when they do in our same way, we have ourselves?
In the Internet journal "Edge" for some years, articles of scientists are published.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series of answers have been chosen to the question, "What do you think it is true, unless you can prove it?"
I believe the animals have feelings or other conscious states, unless I or someone else has been able to prove it, because we can't even prove that other men have the consciousness.
But in this case, we have to hope at least, that all human brains have the same base setup.
9. In addition to other species, we ask questions on the feeling or in general of conscience, we enter into a immediate area, because the reference base is not combined.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he dos the same thing that dos also other animals. It's amazing to be dead, fucking or attacking.
People are in the same way, from where some scientists understand that there is a parallel feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain will make us difficult to move our feelings to animals.
From one part, the side prefrontal cortection of the human consciousness, the associated circuits (as for its direct share in short memory and executive and control functions).
In the man this wide area is very developed than in other primates, and it seems that between other creatures it misss completely.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness depending on the prefrontal cortection, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation on the presumptuation is thus agreed that the man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic specificity should be presented in the way to speak about humans: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said that it is linked to conscience.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although the comprehensiveness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as it has been done, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our conscience.
So it is difficult to find how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analysing it through its own experience because of the special hardware, their research will make us great problems.
Most of the interpretations refer to the contents of the conscious experience, but in particular there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to have access.
The processs of the consciousness of animals may be analysed without their contents, and exactly this happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, that Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, they go before the neural correlations of the conscience that caused mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessary.
In interest, this principle also provides the value of the prefrontal cortection for the implementation of the visualization.
So what is the decline for the feelings?
I imitate them that an emotional system like the fear is active in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we indicate as "paura" is then the mental state in which we find when the activities of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) is working memory.
Thus, the feelings are stretchly connected to the regions of the Cortecy, which characterize the primates and, in particular, the human being.
With the speaking nature, we are creating sustainable disfusions of hearing, because we can distinguish and category the situations, to describe it to others.
I respect this, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings result from the most primitive activities of the body's feelings of cortection and cephalo pale, such as Jack Pankseep, which, however, has concentrated more on the paleocephalo.
Since this network in human evolution has not been very changed, this could absolutely be part of the feelings exhausted in the species .
At purely theorical level, I can't contradict it, but I think it is invisible.
Pankseep brings arguments on the fact that what for rates and human beings appears like fear, probably warns both cases: but how can you check if the rats and humans prove the same thing when they do in the same way?
Is a smoking in danger hurry like he also felt the fear?
In my eyes, the simple likeness of behavior can not show any living comparison yet.
And that's the neurological confrontation continues to be helpful: rates and human beings have similar paloencefails, scarfaces or even a brain.
But is it responsible for feelings?
And whenever it could show it for human beings, how would it be shown on the rates?
I think the rates and other mammifers, maybe addict the insects (who knows?), feeling.
But I didn't know how to show it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from us (for the time that human conscience is based on circuit and language specifics), I prefer to study the emotional behaviour less than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In any case, there are progress at neural level, at the agreement that reaches the same procedure on rates and men.
As I don't do research on language and consciousness in rates, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be myspa, but I prefer to make steps forward, just to swallow up constantly against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional appeal.
The President of the EUFA Platini: relief for Poland and Ukraine
The first vice Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will be submitted under the right responsibility of the President and the first Minister.
"The Government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," said Wasjunik
"But this is not an amnist for our country.

Dennis Quaid wrecked
He wanted to promote a new film, in interview he spoke about the private and now he has a branch with the ex: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan declared adulter his ex Dennis Quaid.
He's robbery and smoke.
Guerre of the Roses at the late time for the old couple of marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two actors of Hollywood are now talking to one with another a brutal litiy - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American Review InStyle last week for the first time he expressed the reasons for marriage falling: "Dennis has been long infidel, and this was very painful."
The port of traditions you would have come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "leather of the soul" was the work with the print of Ryan for his new film "The Women" – the story of a adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to his being publicly declared adult husband was clearly disappeared: it would be "udited," said the fiftyquattrenne to "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the last time repeated and repeated the story of our relationship."
It would also be "deployable" that Jack, the Sedecian son who had been together again, "they were published by the pain and the survey, that a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is again married and shortly becomes the father of eggs.
And therefore his judges close the arrow: "My life in every case is going to go.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family to which everything's going for the best."
The prices for aeroplane and hotels
In the first half of 2008, the flights and losses in Europe have been more economic in respect of the previous year.
In Germany, according to the current study, the vols would be added to 50% more economic
Vols and disappearments in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and traveling American Express.
The company analysed its data of the first half of 2008 prenotations and after a increased prices in the first trimester has observed a clear calor in the second trimester.
After the prices on the hotel market increased for years, the permissions in many places are already cut off prices.
From January to March, the prices of 41 of 48 European cities are still considered around 6,9 in respect of 2007
However, since April to June, the prices were already at 3,6% lower respect for the previous year.
The most clear trend would be in Paris and Rome, where the travellers had to pay 30 to 37% in less respect for a year ago.
The American Express sees how this is why the deep quotation of the dollar, which would have brought to a "calante want to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Francoforte and London would also be touched from the receiving of the hotel prices in more stronger way of industry centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In Norway, the prices of hotels with a increase of 26.3% are holding the record in Europe
In the case of the prices of the air, the tendency in the first trimester still refers to:
Because of the cherosen renewing, the Economy Class passors had to pay in average 7,1% in respect of 2007, the long-term rate of carburant would be added to 29,2% more dear.
Since April to June, the prices of the air carriers of the Economy Class are in average of 12,5 % in accordance with the previous trimester, in the first class and in Business the changes of prices have been largerly difficult.
In Germany Prices are still more stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, the prices were exceeded from 11,9 %, in the second trimestre were declined from 23,6 %.
As regards the internal German volets according to the study, the prices have been added.
The reason for the price cross would be a part of the economic growth in the bottom, explaining the company.
The request in many segments of the aircraft market has been raised.
On the other hand, we would be through the Agreement on the open heavens, which liberalizas the air traffic between Us and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
The sign of the critical situation would be the supply of non-reliable treatment in the Airlines, as well as the high number of air company that in the first half of 2008 would have declared a failure – only in Europe has been treated with 24 air companies.

It's gonna be a day without a real party.
"We are able to put everything all right," said Marcell Jansen.
He presents that the provisionary certificate of table is more index of the improvisibility of the campaign than the domination of his HSV.
The team with its new inhabited arrivals later – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the defensor of Petric gate as well as Jansen souffled by the FC Bayern – found that lately himself, but it was not yet able to light.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," relationship with Jol strength.

The dark material influences the air of space flows
Since years a phenomeno mysterious makes perplexity between scientists: the dark material influences the speed of spaces during the Swing-by hand.
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einsteins' relationship may be not exactly.
The Ulysses Space Sonda has flyed through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the tubations of the carburant that are quickly congelated on her now the death for congelation.
A mysterious phenomenon of scientists have been raised – the anomalia of Swing-by
The Swing-by is an aircraft of space shoes, with which they get additional slancy/spinta/oxycleation in a gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So the branches can be very carburant.
The Euro-American research sonda Casini-Huygens has used this physical expedient as well as the Sunday Ulysses.
What's amazing studies for years: racists do not do anything as we expect in accordance with the law on gravitation.
In addition, it comes to irregularity in speed.
The sonds become faster or easier.
Before the physicians couldn't explain this effect.
The year rebatted the Swing-by Anmalia.
Some experts fear that maybe the general theory of the relationship of Albert Einstein, which describes the attachment force of the matter with a curvature of the space, may not be exactly.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes strongly as before Einstein was not wrong, and try to explain the Swing-by anomaly through this dark material that the astronomes have noticed in the cosm.
"Anamalia's responsible may be the dark material that could also be very close to the earth," wrote.
From the existence of the dark material, the studies of the space are known only for about 10 years.
Of course there is a force of attraction from her, which effects on other heavenly bodys will be seen.
Instead of all invisible, it means not sending nor reflecting any electromagnetic radiation of sort, especially subject to any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark material constitutes at least a good fifth of the whole massage of the cosm.
Turists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their sequencers, the tourists who were rapped in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian Minister of Foreigners confirmed.
The recipers from Sudan asked several millions of euros.

In the south of Egypt, 5 Germans have been ratified.
The review treatments have already been successful.
Germans are always in the mirror of sequestrators.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in Sahara are immediately free.
This reported in accordance with the television of Egyptian state, the Arab Emittent Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Minister of Foreign France Frattini confirmed the release after the cronnace of the Italian television officer Sky TG 24: "Our conciits and other residents have been released
We are looking at their health state," says Frattini.

The 19 components of a sentence in the wilderness have already been traveling for the Cairo.
It is not clear that the backscene of a separation occurred before the release of the residues: thus the rapitors after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would have been prepared for the conclusion of the ransom, before the Southern Army had killed in surprise 6 of them.
"The problem was resolved.
They were agreed for a rescue," said the officer.
It would be "the only treatment to take the rests" when the incompatibility has arrived "this surprise".

The wounds of the patriarch "with to suicide"
Years of abuses from the patriarch have brought a woman to kill himself, she stated a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, Cornovilla, was in prison for 6 years after he had eight cases of sexual aggression.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she had five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court recognizes that Mrs. Randle was killed in his house in Mutley, Plymouth, 1 April 2007, at 34 years old.
When she was a kid and lived in Coventry, Trerise bought her and blessed her before having sexual relations, while her mother was out to work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in Ottanta years, and he returned to live in Cornovalia.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learns that Mrs. Randle, who had exposed a lot of time as voluntary at National Trust, was punished by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Ministry of Ramsey Quaife said to the court that the friends of Mrs. Randle, who was a beautiful surface and cicilist, was "emotionally dead", and that he had "molted with life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
He thinks he's killed by suffocing himself with a plastic bottle.
Mr. Randle encouraged his daughter's mother, who wrote a letter of confession that finished, "I've seen her and blessed her."
"I didn't hurt it sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
The judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You're a very stranger feticist, and for her victim must be terrified, especially when she was only seven years.
"This disgusting sake ends with the victim that is removed the life.
The more hard is the fact that if he hadn't done it, it would be difficult that the facts were finished before the court."
I know the effects that the father and the mother of Stephanie described have had on their daughter in these years.
"Altriments were clearly likely that you were a promising and happy young success."
The official who has lost the data will be punished.
The Office of the Office which left the top secret documents on a June should be accused by the Official Secrets Act, has approved the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It's the less delicate of the accusations formed in accordance with this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal trial.
The correspondent of the defense of the BBC Frank Gardner said that the move would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They were thinking that this was treated internally in the Mod and the Office of the Office," he said.
The implicated, which cannot be nominated, is to be accused under chapter 8.1 of the Act, the key on the information protection.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the official should be accused by the metropolitan police because of the nature highly sensitive of its work.
The documents lost contained evaluations on al-Qaeda and the capacity of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the Monday decision and was brought out of his house and brought to a hidden place.
Building companys relate to the B&B account
English construction companys may face a account of more than 80 miles of £ after the saving of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government gave 14 billion sterlines to protect the deposits of 2.6 million of Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that price will be paid by all companies that take the money of the reserve, including 59 building companys.
The General Director of the Building Society Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritante" that society and their members have to pay.
The prestige of 14 billion steriles will be paid eventually when Bradford & Bingley's mutuals will be saved.
But the interest that will be achieved at the same time will be paid every year to 700 financial companies who take deposits, but the interest that will be achieved in the breasttime will be advised every year to 700 financial companies accepting deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that 59 building company would be included in that number.
It's irrigant that those institutions that have been conducted in a wise way... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been very less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company should pay in proportion to the deposits that he had, and that companies among them should pay 18% of the cost.
The Tesoro believes that the interest on the prestist will mount to 450 million sterlines in 2009.
This means that society should find 81 million sterlines to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Construction Society Association, said to the BBC that it is unjust.
"It is irresponsable that the institutions that have been maintained in the market in the review of houses are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been very wise."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation started in 1945.
"We must examine all the aspects in the next weeks to see what options are to protect the building companys and their members from what it may be a significant account," added Mr Cole.
The interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year at the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of a whole year will be due, and this may be almost two times above.
Since the construction companys are mutual organizations without actions, their members are finished to pay the account through higher targets or lower interest taxes on the payment accounts.
The latte sale to 5 penny to litro

Reject the presence of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Court of Bangladesh refused a request of caution from the previous Minister Sheikh Hasina, that means that you may be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him an assessment for 50 million tax (729.700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of the Parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption accusations against you.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of the month.
The return in Sheikh Hasina is set for the next weeks, but its party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by military days before the total freedom.
The correspondants say that while she was going to the outside for medical health on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that it will be called to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high court rejected the request of caution for Sheikh Hasina, introducing that you can't have the caution seen that he's already out of the word for medical health," said the lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present or call against the Order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs caution to return to the country from the outside to prepare the elections of December.
He waited back to Sheikh Hasina's home after October 17, he said a Sunday leader of the Awami League party.
She was arrested last year after the military government took the power, but was released in June to go to the outside to get medical health.

BSkyB loss the legal battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal battle with the Commission's decision to obligate the company to reduce its participation in the ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the Court of Concurrency to cut down its actions in ITV from 17.9% at less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that the participation of BSkyB remained competition and allowed an unjust influence on ITV.
BSkyB buyed the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB participation in ITV seems doubts on the independence of ITV, taking into account the competence of the Commission.
The chief of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the Offcom's regulatory was opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that it forced it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedie - particularly as BSkyB had said it would override its voting rights.
New research on the case of the Statent Procureur
The American Officer named a special Ministry to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation has occurred when a report on the case of the general inspector of the Critical Justice Department is reported by the administrative officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the lawyers and the ex-general general Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made to escape from fear that the managers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Ministry Nora Dannehy will now invest if the officers in question during the investigation have lying to investigators in trying to stop justice.
"Serie accuses potentially criminal behaviors have not been completely investigated or approved," said the general Glenn Fine in his report.
The admission of a special public ministry with the power to prevent witnesses was one of the main recommendations.
The debate began when nine American officers were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that the lawyers were released by excessive performance.
But later, it concluded that the eligible lawyers were not more evaluated than many other colleagues, bringing many observators to conclude that the release was motivated by the political policy.
Some of the officers were involved in the judicial action against the Republic members of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the fraud accusation of democratic electors.
American officers are investigating and carrying forward causes in court for the government's account.
They may be released at any time, but they can not be released for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the general officer Alberto Gonzales, was found in the tempest for the licensing, and finally reached his position.
A certain number of other officials of the Department of Justice have been deleted.
(The report of the general inspector was very critical in respect of the role of Mr. Gonzales in the case, saying that it was a primary responsibility in the licensing, which had provided his role of leader and was strained in the process.
Other officials, including the former assistant of Bush Karl Rove, were criticized to have not cooperated with research.
The Ephesians of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured to Q Awards for her inno episode Bat Out of Hell.
The singer, who will repeat his special gold price to the ceremony of the next week in London, said to be "honour" to guarantee the recognition.
The song, which was nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the hit album of Meat Loaf in 1977.
The Coldplay will lead the nominations for the premies of this year, in the list of names in four categories.
Paul Rees, director of the Review Q, said, "There are some songs that transmit things as time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is without doubt one of these."
The song, combined by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality given by the Meat Loaf.
He was opened with a structural section that was almost two minutes.
The song was realized as a single in the U.S.A. in 1979 and the fifth place arrived.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in classified and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for a heart-regular struggle in 2003 after he rolled on the ball.
In 2007, the concerts cut off the concerts.
It's late that he had a cup on a vocal cord.
Scarlet town streets, often forgotten and may be quickly in sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevard, streets and other travels, some famoses, other good use.
But too many you taught veterans and residents for a long time are hard to give the position of Extra Place, for most because they have never heard talking about it.
The small road is in East Village and go north from the First Road – without doing the Second Road – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
Circa 30 feet of width and 120 length, likes more like a polverous cycle than a active via trafficed.
There's no travel signals.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlant.
The road must, however, have ammirators.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the immobilier company of the recently built on the First Street.
It wants to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner pass for business and boots that should open in new buildings.
Other admirators include nearby a long time that say that they were struck out of the street just because it was one of the last residences of the past quarter.
But the department of conservation and development of the city, which has the control of the streets, does not interest to keep it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the use of the common Commission of the circuit, some representatives of the city and Avalon Bay have delineed a proposal for the immobilier society to buy the roads.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new plan to present the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the Director of the Community Board 3.
"It's a lot of space left to the property of the city, and we wanted that the city continued to possess extra Place," he said.
"It may be the proposals to system and manage it, which may be made by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that he wanted to reopen the small road and install places to sit, including some to use for a coffee where the immobilier company hopes to fix the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay was buying the street was published for the first time in this month.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay portfolio, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not mean necessary that you want to possess.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this deleted victoria and transform it into a public aim," he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, an Allogi Conservation portfolio, said that the city was wanted to sell the road and has noted that the purpose of the Agency was to develop the property to administrate it.
In contrast to your most colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a read story printing.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company possessed by Philip Minthorne was divided between his many children and the stretch strips of the earth were not recognized.
The CBGB's back door, the Punk Rock monument closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is probably known as the seat for the covering photo of the Ramones' Rocket to Russia.
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was a cold of immunity, branches of bottoms and pieces, posters, boards, branches."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write the "gentration" of the East Village, have been opposed to the idea of sell Extra Place, introducing that the piece of public property, modest as it, should remain publicly.
Others loud extra Place as a rarity – a town frame of almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The book of lamentations: A little nestly looking at the city in the outside way"), published part of a New Yorker's history that appears on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, writes: "Extra Place is an anguish town without exit, white also day and delimited doors of stores in broken yellow and windows with saracinecs, with older journals of weeks that run long the grounds."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same of a recent night.
A rating was actively running through the back of the street close to a door that led into the CBGB, which is now the site of a aristocratic treatment of clothes.
His walls were graffitis and an empty bird bottle of 2211 eggs close to a group of missed day frequency.
A few pasts have said that they rarily thought about Extra Place, but they suggest that it would have to be a little amazing.
Mr. Fields, by his part, said that some people also think that the travel attractions in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, sports and disgustants."
The Bianca Debatte: emergency in English
In this point of Educative View, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on the Big Education.
Lance T. Izumi, an elder member in California studies and the senior director of educational studies in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "No good as you think: Because the media class needs to choose a school."
Attaching the Spanish electors really is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
The campaign of Mr. Obama notes that, "Afro-American and Latin students have significantly less probable to diplome than the white students, "It's true.
In order to fight these charities in the achievement of the objectives, Obama's education plan is specifically supported, among other things, " transitionary big education" for English students.
However, Obama's question is if its commitment for the Big education, which enhances teaching in language class different from English, does not take account of its interest in the training of learning divergences.
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school in the east continent of Los Angeles.
Students in school are for the most Spanish and low reward.
More than one third of students, many of those who have come recently, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprising 100% of students have made the higher level test in the series of mathematical state of 2008.
Another surprising 93% of the fourth students have made the experienced level test on the art-di-linguish- English art.
This incredible result has been achieved by using a different ingredient from the favorite of Mr Obama.
Sixth Street infects the return and exercise, constant assessment of competences and an appreciation of the type "note excuses".
Moreover, and here is that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of the Sexth Street, the structive approach of school for English students is "ful humidance".
The use of English includes almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who's opposed to the bicycle education, said, "We had a fantastic success with a student just come from Mexico and if you were entered into class 12 months after you wouldn't have been able to identify what it was."
"Function", he observed "for us."
Would Obama take a model of school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other schools in most of the Spanish schools and with English students?
The results from the school are responding to that very easy question, but the education policy in its same party (National Education Associations is a long-term supporter of the Big education) and its support continues to be undertaken by the Big education will prevent the answer of Mr. Obama.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently reviewed the argument when he said that people should stop concerning the law "only English".
But he said, "You should be sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these lakes of achievement, it should be considered carefully the education models that work as much as discharge them or banish them.
Economic fear is broadcast and renews
The prices of the petrolio are brutally reduced on Monday because of concerns that even the American Safety Plan for Financial Markets may not be able to reach the economy.
The future of the grey has fallen from 7% to 99.80 dollars to the barle at the market boat of New York in the morning operations.
The prices have lost more than 20 dollars to the barl last month.
In the past two weeks, the markets of the first material have been exhausted from Wall Street's financial attitude, and a few powerful uranians in the Mexican Golf.
After getting a little $145.26 in June, the prices were crossed until at least 90 dollars at the beginning of this month, before reliating again, on the background of a threaten insurance in the financial markets.
The anxie has influenced the investors again on Monday even after the congressive leaders had said that they have arrived a agreement in the weekend on the saving plan, the largest of the history.
The news was dark by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from the past.
In the last episode of progressive fusion, Citigroup will include the Wachovia Corporation bank operations, said the Monday government.
At the same time, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg have partly nationalized the Fortis European Financial Conglomerate.
The Barclays Capital analysists said that the frenetical negotiations of the weekend had been brought to a saving agreement " seemed to have failed to reveal the feeling of the market.
While the worse economic situation is expected that the question of primary materials, including the pet, will be quiet.
"The perspective for global equity, interest taxes and change markets has become uncertain," wrote in a note to the investors the Deutsche Bank analysists.
"We believe the first materials will not be able to escape the account.
From a perspective of materials first our most precious concern is until the American virus will spread globally and specificly to China. "
Bank analyzers have disappeared their expectations for the next year while the consumption of petrolium houses due to the increase of economic growth, reducing the preventions on the price of the petrolium and the gas of about 20 per cent of 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter signs a team record.
After exposing more time anyone with the uniform of Jets in the last eight and more stages, the defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked at the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without points into a mount.
"Never seen something like," said Ellis.
The second fourth is beginning after the Jets and Cardinals were equivalent to the grid of the mixed clouds that override them with a smoke game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, offering the perfect signal for a weekday where their growing symptom has made a giant step in the past.
Favre found Coles for other two touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback has fallen and one with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I'm not out of my way," said Faver of all the pasts come to Coles.
It's a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, although people can think."
While Favre and Coles were made of capture games, the defence was severely struck the cardinals of Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vagant launch and relented it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith has proposed another pass and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could be the most notable.
The Cardinals went in advantage on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had reached the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely cut a half of 20 yards, for a profit of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets had ever marked in a quarter.
When it was asked to describe patience, the coach of Jets Eric Manngini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When it was told to him both - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Manggie said, "I can tell you that I loved much more than the second quarter than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a lot of time."
Gerselassie reposed over his world record
Haile Geberselassie of Ethiopia has shown again because many consider it the best maratonete forever, breaking the same record of the world at Berlino Sunday Marathon and become the first person to run a course of 26,2 miles under the 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the favorite curse at 2:03:59, Gerselassie sent in frantums for 27 seconds his previous score from 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
In 35 years, Gerselassie sets the 26th record of the world of a so unbalordable carrier that produced a world campionate or a record of the world at every distance from a miles of metro to the marion.
Last month, Gerselassie salted the Olympic Maratone of Pechino, fearing - maybe too alarming, in retrospective - that air pollution would have worse his assma problems.
Yet, he decided to run to Berlino.
In nearly perfect conditions - soldied and 48 degrees at the apartment, 55 degrees at the arrival - Gerselassie has wind Sunday with a average scotting of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per billion.
Not just half fundamentists such as Gerselassie and Paul Tergat del Kenya have gone to long distances, the record of the Maratona has fallen over two minutes in the past decades since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil was gathered to Berlino at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday Wednesday, Gerselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had the cramps and missed a week of advantages.
Obviously, the rest left him fresh, not broken.
"I'm so happy," said Gerselassie to the reporters.
"It was perfect.
I remitted a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but finally everything went well."
It was a little criticism - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - for excessively orchestrated his garages, generally eviting many of the best maratonetic stars of the world, counting on the appearist as if it was a half-term garage, and putting the world records above the meaning of competition.
But these critics rarily reduce the size of the competences of Gerselassie as maratoneta.
With the step falling from four Sunday Kenians, Gerselassie has arrived in 1:02:04.
Two Chinese chineses of elite, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have held in competition Gerselassie after the appeals are disappeared.
At least three thousand from the arrival, Gerselassie made a final emphasis to separate from Kwambai, which ended according to 2:05:36, improved his best personal time at about 5 minutes.
Kamathi has arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the female garage, Irina Mikitenko, birth of Kazakistan, which now is German citizen, has completed a notable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh time fastest forever.
Paula Radcliffe of the British holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last primary, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a winter at the surprise of London Maratona in 2:24:14.
The Pechino Games were lost with what is described as a serious incidence, but he is guaranteed to win in Berlin, makeing his best personal time at about five minutes in the third Marathon.
You've run a gara by doing well the calculations, allowing a quarter of ethiopic and Chinese courses to go with a large distance, getting them back after about 18 miles and half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia has arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop del Kenya has finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city party, honour and processes of a black life
In the park with excessive issues on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, from the dream, from the fierce, the quiet city in which the honour and the complications of the African American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city entered in the country and the birth house of Zora Neale Hurston, is not more simple as the description in 1935: "The cities of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 brawn skins, 300 good news, two schools, and no prison."
Now it's a place of plot.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the age of Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
However, in many ways, the city that he described - and that stops tourists understood it in the tourist guidance of Florida produced by the Federal Writers' Depression project - remains a party place.
It's so independent, dignity and private as it was in the thirty years, when Hurston wrote that the rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, which "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what's going to lose."
Even now, in a year where a black president name, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for a discussion of opening on the race, many here remain different in the view of the outside.
"We are very careful about how our story is telled," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident from the whole life and member of the oldest church of the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradose of trionfo and difficulty.
It's a story model of black power and a community of almost 2.400 where poverty rate is twice the national media.
It is a literary center but also a example of the shadows of the rural rural culture of the southern - sometimes disdedened, sometimes pregnant - born by the American slave.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are praises and protectives.
And the concern for the imagination of Eatonville started really with Zora, who all here called Hurston.
She presented the world to her birth city through true books, dialect riches, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the guidance of Florida transformed the city, just outside the Rout 17, a road running through the most forgotten centre of Florida in a black story scenario and human drama
Down as a branch is in the life and in the literature, Hurston brought readers to the business in the first case of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, to depart in more private areas.
"Besides the way to the left," writes Howard Miller always, thinking that he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "see drinks of all kinds and whatever it is added to the past rooms."
So in a few hundreds of words, Hurston connected to Eatonville with self-government but also with analphabetism, second neighbors and sex.
Of course this wasn't from Fodor.
In fact, it wasn't a retreat that all appreciated.
"Now she said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls of Johnson, who's unmortal Hurston's citating men who sing grossolans songs about their beauty.
Add: "Ad some people don't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living spectrum that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston was in the city, he usually arrived without prejudice in a chevrolt trionf, smoking and drying pantalons in a city that even today was worthy of the dignity building.
Many inhabitants were worried, says Mr. Franklin, while others suggered.
"The people were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But he added, putting himself on his seed on the path on the back over the Sabelian lake, where Hurston was probably been baptized, "He never remained long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were gone out of print.
In the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to be forgotten.
Although it was a star of literature, a contemporary contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20s, he came to enter into a grave without late to Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorative ceremony, and there were no great conference.
"I don't believe they understand their contribution to the world or his release to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change happened in the 80s.
The Orange County officers wanted to locate a carrier on five corse through the city to repair Kennedy Boulevard, the main route to two courses.
Orlando's expansion has already broken the Interstate 4 through the west border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still raising from a difficult period of his history.
The strengthened integration, in addition to other things, had finished the related iillian isolation of the Community.
In the fifty years, the battle on the racial mixture brought hate on the door of the community.
"In that period, a group of white boys came and throw up and things to people who sat at one part," said Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who remained killed from that time.
They've got a cooking from a machine."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a strong integration request, defined by its decision in Brown against the school office "insulting less than a honor for my race".
The residents now say that the degree of schools, although they have been positive under some aspects, declares the cohesion of Eatonville and entruses the confidence of their young people.
"The black kids were usually used to be broken - I remember this - I remember your teacher on the morning, to break your teacher night," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the Executive Director of the Eatonville Community, a group of non-profit.
This suddenly, he added, until teachers and students were from the same place.
"You don't break your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, in any way, helped and create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, attorney and artist who overlied the prejudices, as he did, with joyful security of themselves and lines such as: "How can some reject themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't just understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began a long journey for the tomb without a target of Hurston and began fighting for her reputation.
Five years later, a biography accurate on Harston of Robert E. Hemenway shot the library scaffles, bringing it back into the American canon.
The project of the autostrate came exactly while her most famous daughter had covered the lights of the ritual.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what she could rob the status with her autostrate.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the memoration.
A lot of years later, he turned back from his project to the road.
"The five corse of the autostrate resurrected, they took what would say high speed, a real honor for the city," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easierly: "Now he saved Eatonville."
Victory on the project of the autostrate has helped to change the imagination that the city has its own.
Those outside towns like Rachel Munson, a lawyer who began to come in the church in 1993, began to appear in long number, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville was added to the public history record in 1998.
A new library to a single plan (called as Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard reviewed and abbreviated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomalia of Florida: only six thousand from the center of Orlando, you can give the feeling of a secondary way under the extreme rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(It's at 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who are coming to search for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often treated with care.
A requested permission is required for most of the interviews, at some things - such as the walls on the oldest church of Eatonville, cut down by a white man, who do see black men in the fields - they do not have the permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a grassoccy teacher, with a debt for the brilliant red, still fears that their insulate community becomes franzing.
However, while Hurston festival was expanded, it is also a high level of citizen honour.
Young people, particularly, have to see Eatonville with Hurston, saw their whole race: beautiful, problems and everything, not better, no worse and fever, creative, great worker, shooca and confused as other ethnic groups in America.
It is seriously aware of what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, which projects to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the police Department, which he said might have needed help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-olds from Winter Park, seems to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"More people, if they're just in here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing against all the others," said Alondra Kenon after the mission in a recent weekend.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a favorite city."
Here in New York, we all talk freely of financial
In the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were remote from the journal banks and the large TV screens of Times Square, they would not be able to stay in the eyes of the cycle.
They would never advise that the officers of veterinary officers, on their heads, banks and hedge managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst "breed day in office" from the role of 1929.
Fabrics shoot metal carriles for the track of marciapiedes, transporting muffin vaccines for collection meetings.
Latin-Americans move the feet between condomen by bringing, such as human mulls, 50 and steat stealing stealing stealing stealing stealing on their skins.
Useds are still waiting at line for their ball tomorrow at the carriers of food on marciapedes, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It seemed not that there was a real crisis, until, with all the discourse of robbery and sorrow, I decided to open a new book of repair afternoon.
Even if I had planned the facting so that I agreed with the breaking of the late morning with my JP Morgan Chase office, a couple of about 20 was already waiting at line.
Not before the sport of the casser, to remove money or deposit, but before the sport of the client service, where old customers order books, tourists ask directions for the great Macy magazine and new clients have received accounts.
Many of those who are before me, I would learn from Starr, my "fit banker", were in line for myself reason.
In contrast to me, however, they have already prevented the rewards from the smallest banks from the places which the pendolers do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have made the money from such thrifts (at least as a construction company), credit and types of banks of towns whose offices operate only within a state, and they say to treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have been missing.
The last days in Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in active, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the newyorkes were leading home for the weekend for a weekend a weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with 440 billion dollars, was searching for a purchaser who would save it.
The employees and workers who were before me, impauried for another cold, were cutting their money to a perceptive bank as a safe port, the bank who asks more cautions in Wall Street.
The common newspapers in the last weeks have been competent in financial.
A woman to my Chinese surmarket of confidence, speaking to the phone, was reported to Lehman Brothers, the bank goes in falling, and to her general emotional director Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if she launched from a pig coach.
And Lyn, the portiny in uniform, almost 50th of my condominium, has changed the subject with respect to our normal conversation argument on Brad and Angelina or delivering my expenditure.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "I have all my resources in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
Musulman's profaned while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Australian Lake of the Liberty Partie and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, are part of a demonstration to present the "Città against Islamisation" organization in Anversa, January 17, 2008.
They are carried out the type of the Moschee Representatives with a red line that passes in the middle.
The police has inclined the right extremists to profan a Muslim cimiter in Austria, the same week that the political parties of the right stream have won very much to national elections.
More than 90 graves, Traun's cimiter, near Linz, was seriously hurt at some time between evening and this morning, in which the police believed was an organizated action.
The criminals have tracked with the Hebrew symptoms like the Star of David above some graves, but the detectives believe that it could be a trial to mascher the extremist motivations guided by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the accident is linked in some way to the elections.
A portfolio of the local islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" from the news of the profanation, which happened to the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
The Austria at the same time was invaded in a way of spiritual research after its movement to the right in Parliament's elections yesterday.
The two right extreme parties who have taken nearly 30% of the votes, the party of the Austrian freedom and the Alliance for the future of Austria, have made a campaign with ticket flexiblely anti-immigration and some of their slogans have been defined by xenofobi criteria.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Liberty Party who wins more than 18% of votes, has made a campaign against the old and the burks and has also expressed its opposition to food that are perceived as connected to the Islam.
At the end of Vienna, he spoke of a "European fratellance" to prevent the growth of Islam.
In addition, the parties seem to be broken by the construction of muscles and minerals, thus showing that they are political symbols of a continued islamism of Austria and Europe.
Sounds and analysis did immediately after the elections, which have established the right stream as the strongest political block of the nation, indicating that the change was brought to predominance by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Traveling to the east intermitted to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the flamour star of the criminal rock of sexual abuse on minors, was prohibited to travel in France and Spain from the court.
The judges have set the division of six months in Glitter after he had informed the authorities who checked him to go Spain through France.
The foreign travel prohibition came to Kent's police last year after he delivered to the judges the test of former arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, a real name Paul Gadi, was not at the audience of Ashford's pressure in Kent, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A portrait of the Court Service said: "On September 25th at the Press of Ashford, Kent's police have submitted a request to stop the journey outside of Mr. Paul Gadd in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not a person."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities to want to travel to the outside as it was required by the registration of condemnations for sexual reliefs.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel to the outside for more than three days.
It is also required to give the police a warning of seven days on its date of department.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a judgment to five years of prison.
The Kent police said not to discuss the individual cases or the possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A Kent police portfolio said, "Kent police will make all the needs to protect children in this country or outside.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have complete systems to maintain any potential risk more effectively.
"Protect Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the conduct of condemnations for sexual reactions registered in the country to minimize any possible risk for public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he had spent 27 months in a Vietnam prison for abusing two girls of 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter arrived, Glitter flyed to Bangkok where he had to go on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Taiwan authorities would not have made it to pass to the passport control and finally took a air for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not leave him to enter and return to Bangkok where the Thailand police and the officers of the immigration were invited to return to England.
At the end he arrived to the terminal 3 of Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Press of Uxbridge, West of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for a order to insert it in the register of the judges for sexual reports.
Litter was carried out in the United Kingdom in 1999 because he had obtained images of infants.
A source of the Internal Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of Internal, felt that Glitter was stopped by traveling in France and Spain.
"Fotograph the teacher away from the scene to extra the character" Günther Bauer, photograph
No tickets, no shoots, no dress from the first.
Only the essence of the large masters of the flamenco, spoiled by the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the appearance of a man or a woman.
One part of the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Two inseparables, besides the private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimity of a gest, the depth of a robbed look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don't have to go to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" changes the theatrality of some singing, balls and chitarrists on the ball with the less known side of these teachers.
With this objective, the photograph offers a original iconography of the flamenco, collecting it from various visual angles.
The show, included in the Programming of the Moon of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this ball, every day greater," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" can also be treated with common people, but seeing the photos, the observer does not know that they are the typical images of artists, interpretors or executors on the scene.
These retracts "on the road" are "artists can send passion, sorrow, joy when they are in the scene ... and catch the public.
In order to collect the personality of these big ones, it is not necessary to rent them into the scene,
because their personality and characters are inside.
What I was interesting was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to catch the personality of the larges of the flamenco machine."
With the passion for the festival "Cance de las Minas", Bauer started in 1997 a long road to ride songs, chitarrists or balls using a photomac to lastre.
They are retracted that, because of the type of machine and material, they remember the classic photograph.
The application of various style technology breaks with the traditional principles of the image, confering to the modern photo, according to a idea that reflects the concept of the flamenco of Bauer's own: "A music with very traditional roots that grow and is able to surprise every day."
Not the ballar, the song or the song in himself, but the personality of the artist, its character, can conquer the public with his artist.
The search of a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way to hear and to be, are and have been the cost of this work, in exposition in these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Famous artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Chanles, Vicente Amigo, among others, are figured in this selection of about seventy retracted artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of the flamenco, and will be published immediately in a book that will collect the exhibition retracts at the time of the show.
The passion for the retracts brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Sportart Project" "Sportart Project".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer accepts "I love retreat people, know them and can penetrate for a moment in their life, this is a long or short existence.
I think the retract is the most difficult kind of photography.
Meet you or compare with people, personality that sometimes you don't even know or that allow you only a few minutes to scat the photo.
From there of these circumstances, as a photographer, I'm always trying to concrete my ideas."
The collection of retracts of the contemporary flamenco-people, named "Flamenco-people", is all in the gallery El Fotomata, at the 20th way of the Mata, parallel through Alameda de Hercules, and will be opened to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa clears that the romance written is a "azardo"
It is environmental in places that still doesn't know and talk of unknown arguments: Although this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the presence of a new project that works, a Romance which is protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lives 20 years in Congo and has passed through Amazonia.
From always favored for the Nobel Premium for the literature, the writer confessed yesterday in the case of Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project of which he's busy today is "he's an azardo" and that "all indicates that I don't have to write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it likely, and I hope to end it as before," so he concluded his intervention to the festival for the change of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw over to the city of the Academy a hundred of writers, history, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was, as from prognostic, the figure of pick at the third editing of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who wins the price of Hay Festival to be the most voted writer of the participants – an ancient design of the book "Our Mutual Friend" of Dickens, filled the positions of the theatre John Bravo.
Presented by Felix Romeo, the writer was found before a public at which the time was flying when the peruviano, with a wonderful memory and with great dozens of humorism, he cried as a nacque the literary vocation, denied from the "extreme avenue of reading" and "de living more than what I live", as writes in "disciplinated mode" to supplement the "manning of inspiration", with a intense work of documentation, editing and continent repeating; as Faulkner, Vigo, and Alexe Dumas have influenced on his vocation and as the "magin of the memories" that they are based on his rankings.
The Spanish-American Romancier, recognized that "not a way" to measure and to know whether the books can change the life of people, "but I refused to believe that the literature is a pure interpretation, a remote experience," sublined Vargas Llosa, supporting that "he has the effects" and "the most anti-conformists" and that has invited the writers to "not cease to fresh" and "assuming the responsibility" of his own vocation.
The time remains the Festival of Pozoblanco, taking it out of the roads
The festival of the courses that should have suggested the days of the Festival of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday, after the selected tours for the streets were achieved that the conditions of the board were not appropriate.
So, in accordance with Fermin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, the company decided to suspend the celebration of the course.
The intends have been achieved against this Festival in order to celebrate two days at three.
Saturday, the rain has stopped the effort of the second road of torch.
In the cartels, Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, they had to face a tore of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival has been regularly executed only on the Friday.
In this occasion, Daniel Luque was trionfare, cutting three ears and bringing out in trionfo, after tore with pleasure and esthetic.
At the same day, Alexander Talavante took his two chairs with health and one ear, more than the public than for the same route.
The worst among all was El Julie, pasing from the street of Los Llanos without glory and sin.
With the second tower, after a terrible robbery, the fish of great part of the public was guaranteed.
A car with two miles of hashish shooter over the block place in Alava
Five less ten of the morning.
The agents deserve the highest to the two employees of a vehicle, instead of stoping to escape.
The agents intendd to two employees of a vehicle, instead of stoping, they were data on the flight.
Their load, more than two tonnes of hashish, is a good reason to stop.
The agents after they were followed, they can arrest one of the two employees, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. A. J., according to the communication of the Internal Government.
The person arrested is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incidence occurred when some of the Alava strategy workers were carried out a control of transports on N-1, in which this is through the common circumscription of Arminion.

The agents have been data on the sequence until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometres, stopped on the road border, and their two employees were given to the flight in a forest area.
Hertzaintza's agents were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and to sequere the 2.178 kilograms of hashish that transported and had taken the car once inspecioned, a Jewish Daily.
The hashish panels, which were located behind the vehicle, were subsequently set under police guards for an advanced investigation and the relevance of the weight.
Furthermore, since the officers agreed that the matrix was "double" because it was not corresponding to that reported in the documentation of the vehicle, it was also imposed to the failure of public documents.
Hertzaintza continues to arrest the second suspected person, which has been able to escape as already said, and to determine the successful drugs.
The arrest A. A. J., of 28 years, was brought to the police station to implement the appropriate procedures and to be established by the judge in the next hours.
Stop the Heather Locklear attorney for guidance under the pharmaceutical effect
The actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the Popular Serie Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the pharmaceutical effect.
A witness saw him running risk hands while he tried to go out with the car from the parking to Montecito, according to the review of the People from a portfolio of the California Strait.
The testimony indicated that around 16.30 the Locklear was "shitting down the accelerator, makeing a lot of dreams, and trying to carry out the car from the parking with brush hands back and back. When he turned back, he passed more times before his eyes from the sun."
A little later, the witness, who, at first, had not recognized the attorney, saw Locklear was stopped in a nearway road and was out of the vehicle.
It was this person to warn the emergency services, because "I was worried for the life of Locklear."
When the police pattern arrived, he found the attorney sitting inside his vehicle, which was partly blocking the road.

Calls forward to the IU's department to assess their responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator of the UI and member of the United States Isquierda Partie, Gaspar Callamazares, confirmed today that it will take a decision on the case of the assistant to the Joven and the Sport of the Community of Sivilia, Francisco Manuel Silva, which has reported the issues last week after the customer accusation.
"In these cases, they are particularly federal, and it will be the organisation going to be able to assume their responsibilities," said the Lalamazares on the resolution that the Partie will be adopted in accordance with what it has been to be assisted in the civil Council until today.
However, the leader of the UI has sublined the need of "transparency" in all possible researchs as regards the irregularity that Silva would have done. "The UI has always wanted that this type of research we have the maximum transparency."
In the same way, he sublined that the training is regulated by "the very rich ethical code for all public charges".
"Sangre of May", the episode of Garci
Inspiring to Benito Pérez Galldós National Episodios, Jose Luis Garci returns in Sangre of May the famous Spanish revolution against French, which is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the registration tried to "impress the tower of persons and at the same time the social analysis" who always looked at the work of the famous romance, explained today during the presentation of the movie, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevard would be a large cast of interprets.
Monday, more than two hours and half, starts this weekday in the cinema sales, to become a TV ministry in future more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirator of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci supports to have realized with this "un dream of his child," and considered to thank Esperanza Aguirre, which from Madrid's Community had sent him three years before turning a monumental film for the second center of May 2. The register accepted the agreement that the story based on the romance of Episods Nationals.
The 15 million budgets for the whole of the Madrid Community have represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to renew the scenographies and the appropriate costs to retreat a "un a story Spain who wronged the election of the leader to fight and the fact that the fight for independentness brought to the people a great retard in the development under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII.
However, the register remarked that he had not received financials like those of the Alatrists or of Los fantasmas of Goya - more than two respectively to Sangre of May, so it was not possible to turn some scenarios from the scenography that he himself signed at Horacio Valcer, a collaborator of almost all his carrier.
This, for the Record of Rever to begin, has influenced that it is its normal work practice, the messenger in scene with the actors, with which often uses to try to rotate those who will not be part of the cast, because it is considering "humiliant", thinking that "the part of the register's work is in the teatro and the cinema to know what is happening in the area where it works."
Many of the interprets, parts of which they enter in the Sangre of May, test their car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Laranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidated to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that no one of the three candidate films to represent this year Spain in Hollywood's Academy - its Sangre of May, Seven billions, and, the last chosen The ciegos -, they will not represent the youngest generation of the Spanish cinema "which should be known."
This film Garci doesn't expect pressure.
"In the beginning you believe to work for the posters, then you know that you work only for prosperity, and at a certain point you agree to just turn a movie in more," explain Garci after more than 30 years of carrier.
Isabel Bayon finds the civilian essence of the Tortola Valencia
A civillane ballene makes ombre to another ballene like Sivilia.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, the Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and andalusa mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana's room, and at the age of three years was moved with the family to London.
It was a free dancing ballet and a specialist in east dancing.
He led a wonderful life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, Issadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was buddy and vegetarian, and he defended the cause for the absolving of the corset that refused to women to move freely.
The life of this woman, which confronted a revolution in the field of dance and estetics in Europe between the two wars, has always attacked Isabel Bayon.
"I would like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this personality. I felt incredible."
It supports the ballinger: "We're not trying to tell his whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested me some base elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the maripose" suggested me a guarantee, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanks.
His dance was sensitive, and it was told me that my way to ballar is in this street," explains.
The messenger in the scene provides two exceptional contributions: the Miguel Poveda, which will sing again in one of his shoes, as faces "The open door", and the Master Matilde Coral, who exceedingly wanted to work with the one who was his alibi.
"Matilde interpret Tortola from adults, the personality of maturity.
I'm happy because he's accepted to work in my work and I feel very honored."
It includes also the musical and chitarist composition such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Moron; the smokings of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa La Viola, and the cooperation of an actor, Juanfran Juárez, "which interpretates the role of eternal partner of these artists who have been delighted at all, and that they have always have been very amazing."
In some ways, there is also the life of this woman who works in a lot of places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all Europe, because usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think it's one of the women who had a great influence in a given history period, and now no one remembers it and so less considers its operation as something of value," supports Bayon.
The spectacle will begin today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega teatro.
With the publication of the "Diary of a recent married poeta" the Triennium is closed
The presentation of the first edition illustrated by the "Diary of a Poeta Recencad" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, entered in the activities programmed by Assembly to the Culture of Adalucia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and John Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to remember the fifty-fourth anniversary of the Nobel's assignment for literature and death of both.
Thus, the "Trienny of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concluded with the regeneration of this operation, with the International Congress in New York, with the restaurant of the Nobel museum, and with the inherent showing "Juan Ramon Jiménez: that cheap of light" which was insured last May and that, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, it would be in convention with the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Assembly Assembly's Culture of Andalusia has buyed a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poeta Recencado", in care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the disruption of the figure and the work of one of the passenger poets of higher value.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Therefore God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is the attorney Sally Field, who worked with him in the "Authensity of Malcies" and gives the idea of the impotence of the American cinema, and of all America, in the presence of the idea that Newman has gone.
However, he costed him very much to give him a Oscar.
And since 2007 he was in pension.
And she knew it was very sick.
However, it was a very hard shot for everyone.
"Therefore what a test goes over any expression, and I'm now lost a big friend," wept Robert Redford, "My life and my country could be better thanks for his existence."
Nobody was afraid to get ridiculous or exagered.
A father of the cinema and the country is dead in a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the automotive from the American people on earth, the despert search of new motivations to feel worthy.
When the times are so difficult, men so without virus and remain good people to be surprised, they don't need to be Louis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he incarnated the platonical ideal of beauty and truth.
It was an official oppositor of Richard Nixon and a perished causes defender, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the death firstborn of overdose in the creation of the marriage and biological food mark.
All gifts to a country where it is very costed to go over a suitable food culture.
The ammiration drone was more than Hollywood, without curing, nor nationality, nor passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, observed that he wasn't dead a man, was over a time.
Another English, Sam Mendes, recorded with Oscar, said that work with Newman was nothing but his carrier.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, was able to definite Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of higher level for all of us," said George Clooney, maybe one of the little ones who are trying to live today as Paul Newman did: maintaining the need of justice and have a serious and remote life to cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in the median jungle of today.
However, some test us, and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once, but he stayed married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, where he remained faithful, but he wouldn't have the opportunities to be not.
"Why I'm going to eat out of hamburger today, if I have a steel in the house?" she said.
In the heavens, the glory that his daughters are on earth are also his ammiratrics, what is not so common in America.
"To all the great roles he interpreted, of no one was so honourable as of the devoted husband, lovely father, not delighted and approved," they say.
The imperfect corse of a Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or then the Olympiadi will be in Madrid and, after the missing trial for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I ask you, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the course yesterday, I'd just say no!
They called it the "perfect corse", but my opinion was too long the worst at which he had assisted.
A smoke of shocks, which if afterwards had been taken into consideration the assessment and I had to consider them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But we're going by order and starting from the beginning.
The smokes were started with the rent of the dorsal, which supposed that he was going first.
It seemed not a wrong idea, but if they need you to go, that is to remove everything (including the chip to prevent codes during the garage).
Nevertheless not.
You should just go to take the darsal (the first snow, go only for this) and (before the relative coda), surprise! they had only magliettes of the 'S' (second smoothness, because I need a XL table).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small magnitudes, made with small tissue and then less costs?
Well, things of this type are inevitable to the same day of the curse.
Furthermore, I need to go very quickly to take the chip, the chair of wait was 15 minutes and, for more, you had to deposit the sain.
The expectation is longer than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a curse that is waiting for more than 11,000 people.
So, as it was preventable, the corse was started that we didn't even deposit the sain, although, once you were successful in the business, the recovery was even worse.
Furthermore, the rain mined the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which people’s rebellion trials were added to the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow, we will certainly have the polmonite, and some, like me, will not even be fulfilled in the classification correctly because of the chip, which, I suppose, has not registered the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will not be sure in my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream a well prepared Olimpica town.
Microsoft Recipient (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on emergency technology, Microsoft has presented a new human recognition system, a sort of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, in order to implement some basic businesses, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a new service to marry within the field of society) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks for a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - even remember their position in the company - and listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the presents in conversation groups.
For example, the receipt shows a third person, but it understands that it is not the group with which it speaks and that it is not a dependent of the company.
He asks you if he's there to visit someone and tells you that it's gonna be at your disposal shortly.
All without blue screenshot.
It's impressive.
But, of course, this is the future.
Now the company is better to concentrate, for example, on the next version of your Windows operating system.
This week he spoke very about a change of strategies in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have a lot of associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were dotated of the essential and less loaded commercial space, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it's gonna be for "minst".
All a discovery, if you are considered that Microsoft, version after version has continually added Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is approval.
Microsoft has right: the operational system will always lose more important, and with it the software.
When Google started Chrome in the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many are just underlined that a browser is not a operational system.
The operational system will always be needed because it's an impressive element for the hardware and the communicative software.
Take the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your own.
That's true.
It will never lose, but it may be necessary to think about the "dead" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always give less attention to the operational system, and always more to the web browser.
You take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and dayly we'll pass more time to navigate on network than in a remote environment for windows.
What do they need half of the operational system applications?
Least it's more.
And Windows 7 must be less, very less than Vista.
Less pest, less supercaric, less complex.
Microsoft interests more integrating their online services to constitute a valid alternative to Google.
They have a despert need, actually, and I report here a small example.
I cut the photo in this post in one of the recreation locations for Microsoft dependents in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the bibit machine, a cartel offers them to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study was concluded that 66% of Microsoft dependents use Google to conduct a network search.
Last week, the rest was confirmed at the development of the new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not added in 2010.
Microsoft will be sure to start together Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is always become more computers.
But the late, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso took her in the Costa Azzurra, Leonardo of Caprio spreads in the 'Diamant of blood' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino's 'Il Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola, except in the typical uniform of the muscolous gas.
And if we try to number the appearances of the stars, we can revoke the image of the forest with the baffy boards that spread the pieces in the ambulance circuit.
It is, in substance, of the typical magliet of man, with the inside of coton, attilated and without hands.
It's the 'tank', as they call it anglophones, even if, the Belga Fabuleux Marcel spys over all.
The "Marcel" excellent respect to others for the high quality of the coton, for its unisex board, for its distinctive steam and for the small Belgian band (only recognisible), which the most emblematic models of the magliet take as details on the hair.
The "Marcel" excellent respect to others for the high quality of the coton, for its unisex board, for its distinctive steam and for the small Belgian band (only recognisible), which the most emblematic magliet models take as details on the hair.
And attention, because the production of the Belgium is not only the "tank" famous.
He also understood balls for college, boxer back, cardidge of cashmers, coton pantalons, marine magliets, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intemist instructions to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate white.
I'm too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry."
The great comparison with the sister has not stopped developing its personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters took very seriously their new activities in the moda field.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and celebrities that make their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango's signature made its new seat, in addition to the presentation of the most important prices than the Spanish Moda house sponsorizes.
Calm and horrible, he's getting you quickly.
Tell us you're in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we thought of my sister Penelope and I for Mango's high-wind stage, except to participate in the presentation of the second editing of "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner at the Opera in Valentino's Honour.
We said, a very intense day, but at the same time, emotional.
From what elements part of your new collection for Mango in this fourth work station for Spanish house?
It's my sister that I like the cinema of the 50s is 60, we've got several inspirations from here.
Then, I love to lose me in the city and observe how women clothes, as they combine and mix their clothes.
Ballena, attorney and stylist, you're a very versatical woman, isn't you?
I believe yes, even though at the end, it's all involved and there are many common elements.
To me, until the little, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to fruit in the weapons of my twin and to see her apartments.
It was a bomb, even better go to the park games.
Then, once the ballen, I always had a lot of attention to the clothes.
It knows that the balls are very happy to have a own style to go to teaching and wise, to look at the skin and feel well.
And in the role of actor, when they give you the watch is the time you really meet personality.
So, it's all together, yes, with very respect for stylists and professionality.
Not a long time ago, you did 30 years ago, are you in crisis?
But not.
You never hear better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I found that in that age women are mature and have a good experience to explore life in a less error.
The biological hour doesn't fear me.
I did the things I wanted for a little while and this gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, you think you're mom, or not?
Of course, I know I'll be my mother because he asks me my same body, and I want to be a young mom, this doesn't want to lose it.
I don't worry too much about the candidate.
What I will do will give my son much happy and educate him with a loving love.
As regards the cinema, you're in waiting for sleeping in different sales some movies around the last year.
That's right, and I want much to escape.
As a woman comes from the theater, I'm very inquired and worried, I'd like everything immediately and clearly, but it can't always be so.
I want you to escape "The last hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if they like you
A few days ago, you've bought on the ship with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that you were in the past as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, which I know a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a welfare shield for her organization "Donne for a better world" and the rooms we have taken – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - they have been set at the place to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this side of Naomi.
They say so much about her, that I know her a long date I can confirm you that I am not so real.
Moreover, I find this good part in which you're involved.
He asked me to throw up for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pin, I would have done it likewise.
If it is to help women in the third world, you can't get back.
Alcoholic remedial drivers must install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Internal requires that leaders with three administrative sanctions for excessive alcohol in the blood, install in their car the system that prevents the guidance of the vehicle in the stage or if it does not suffice in the appropriate device.
The proceedings were announced last June and have already been made in the annual report of the State General Research, according to which a pilot project will be addressed by a period of a year.
The objective of this project is the reintegration of the conductor, since this should frequencies a rehabilitation course on the road.
In this initiative, in addition to the General Research for Strategy Security, they will participate in the General Directorate of Travel (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Safety (FITS).
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the cars reported more than one time for guidance in the stage of emergency returns to guide the car.
The alcohol would disappear it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the inspired air and disappears to put the car in moving if the driver does not suffer, or when it is detected a higher concentration of alcohol than that allowed.
The cost is higher than 1000 euros and would be carried out of the sanitary.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the municipal vehicles of these devices allow to reduce to 65% of the infractions made during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it calculates that it could save life of 115 people per year.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to be low to these behaviors before they become criminals.
And to facilitate development, since legal reform can be implemented by regular ways, and, without doubt, the necessary reform for criminal procedure would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced in experimental ways in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of the Deputy will vote a initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in the school bus, as it has been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British pointuality, at 17.40, second programme, the Spanish aircraft in which the principles of the Astury aired in the presidency at the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico City.
The sun was traveling, but the rows still costed to use the hand as a view to see the real copy descending from the air.
At the feet of the playlist, the Spanish emissor and the other authorities.
Sometimes I asked a taxiist, for the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to form a official travel.
- Oh, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that moment... you're out of here or...
- No, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a few years.
- Oh, very good...
Mexican pressure, however, knows very well who are the principles of the Astury and the importance of the travel.
Many are waiting for the airport hanging on the Red Tattoo and the military cordon composed by 27 soldiers of the sea who offer honor health.
The principle appears surprising, clothed in blue sea, and you, princess, calls to the wind, very sober, doesn't use its normal "peep-toes", maybe they have mentioned that in Mexico citizens wounded a lot of time.
I regulate the photographs a smile and a short summer before they go into the room where the official committee waits for them.
Before the door of the hotel, one of the four largers of the city, waits for them a spiritual reporter of the Mexico TV.
The best price offered by the mode
Probably there is no place in the most appropriate world to present a moda price, which is not Paris and probably no more squisite stylist in Valentino.
Mango just presented the second edit of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the moda field.
It offers a price of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winter of the first editing, looked at its designs in Mango's vessel at Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris and nearly crying from emotion.
Furthermore, it is the second business of the dining for large in Europe, and it is just opened with 1.335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
So many events, joining the desire to please the Valentino stylist who predicted the concurrent jury, have started with a luxury feast at the Opera Garnier of Paris.
With the nearby of Chagal's most squisitive tele, the President of gal table prepared by Mango, there was more speculative.
Getting, with the intrinsed heart, and makeing victory needs, because of the recent death of the brother's brother, he indood an apartment of the house and some ELAH complements to remove the fire and the arm of the son Luis - a girl of nearly two meters of height - with Valentino with the presidency of the feast.
Andyk, owner and Mr. Mango, made the honours of the house and horse that has finished, sitting on Barone Rotchil, without a jack, because both were cutting them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the business in pantalons and training – designed by his hand – has been transformed for the dinner, droping a long black room very sensitive and has emotionated during the night pass with Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for the saints of ballet and you, remembering other times, he took a bar and broke a "grande more".
Inés Sastre was not stopped for the traveling in the rooms of the palace, but she showed us the photos of his son on the cell.
The next day, we are grateful for the presence of Olivier Martinez – another girl who moved in moto - and John Travolta, who was coming to the Intercontinental Hotel of Paris, with his lenzuola, his accommodations, and were sure that they were not happy in his room.
Star under the star of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the caotic and frenetic everyday life.
And as if it wasn't enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring the relax in the books on 30 September.
The wave is almost a penalty when it switches every morning to 7, but it is still worse to imagine in the frenetic ritm described by the modern life.
The office is called tension and the bad computer.
The stress is the evil of the XXI century.
However, there are no one and even two methods to fight the day-time examination and the fate to disappear from the work world.
No, this number shows nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
From there of joga positions, classic massage or treatment "spa", Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, all a "menu" of options on measure for love and time.
The anti-stress operation is titled "1001 ways to leave" and its calm will get the libraries thanks to the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is not possible to conquer the calm in environments such as the worker or personal relations, this "manual" lies to this convince.
Furthermore, it suggests alternative solutions, as being contacted with nature, or 100% natural resources that contribute to relax.
If the adrenaline isn't gone in your winds to find the equilibration of the body and the street has become a problem, it's the time to sit on the divan, cut off the mind and focus on reading.
Talk in dream
Some children speak during the night.
I don't tell those who wake up very arrogant to tell us something that happened to them last day, but to those children who talk to stay sleeping.
The first time it happens, at least it takes a fear, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a favorable improvement of the dream defined dream.
It appears with a certain frequency, especially in children and children.
Of course, most of you have told you that you were talking in the dream.
This phenomenon can be achieved in a very sportly way (only in life, for example associated with a high february episode) or with a greater regularity (all day, once a week, once in the month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything more.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Perhaps there are episodes connected to other dream disturbations such as incubs, night fears, night shoes (building the pipe), or sonnambulism, but not necessarily so.
As already accompanied before can be associated with very high fever steals, with stress or suffering situations.
In any case, it's a phenomenon still a little studied.
Even the intensity with which appears is extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice sound, with smile words, almost in a surprise or that happens to the contrary (urla, cry, long talks ...).
In the cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be necessary to observe the child and eventually consult a specialist to check if there are some issues that are generating an anomaly status of anxie as a shooter in the situation.
We have said that it is a good increase, therefore there is no treatment as if it is not associated with other dream disturbations that can be treated (e.g. if applied with inson or stress situation).
However, what can be done is considering a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the kid before he's going to sleep.
Provide quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that suffer fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for which it is fatical to relax, you can use release techniques to help them to buy a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreams are coming to keep calm.
Remember that they are inoffensive for the child and that the day afterward will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful advices
Don't wake him up.
It's inutile, because it's not aware of what's happening, and you can interrupt the dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping, and then he's relaxing.
Remember that if it appears very angry and the episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to check where there was a so big angusia in the child.
If you understand what he says (what is not the most common situation), don't fall in trying to make him a questionnaire to get information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleeping and then not conscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says, but not to see what he's dreaming to say, so you need to provide a lot of attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions of which they might bring.
Don't tell the child that you can ask him for the night to know his secrets.
Not for fun.
One thing of the kind causes a lot of angusties.
Slowly, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's a episode that's only a few minutes.
I'll be... finally
Ilhaeusern finally found the way of the victory to home after a long time infructuous.
Without playing a wonderful game, the Yellow-news have created the largest number of opportunities of networks by transforming one in the game's victory.
The ritme was not very supported during this meeting in which attackers were expressed fatal.
After a first trial of the Captain of the Team Hospital Kauffmann, who shooted the seven with a lot shooting, Ilhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of Dannemaria, Fonderflick from farn, then Hirn high, Romein of Pope, and still Diebold.
The Danemaria replied with a block at the center of the field, just leaved Riahi at the attack.
The beginning of the second time was determined with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporary for Dannemaria, and immediately after Marais' first network for Ilhaeusern, well positioned, reached a ball on the first trial of Diebold (53').
But the canonier of Ilhaeusern can't explore his happiness long and will be extracted a dozen minutes after so leave his teams in number lowerness.
But Dannemaria will not approve it and will not make great problems to the Illhaeuser's 11th, directed just to "function" the defense, except in the last minutes of game when, after a rocabole action, the ball smoked the travers.
Sarkozy meetings fishermen in collar
Before you go for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will kill in British.
Instead of the demonstration of fisheries that on Monday have broadly prohibited access to several Breton and Norways, the President of the Republic decided to reach on March to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to sing the representatives.
These lasts have promised to accept it "with constructive spirit" and hope that "they are present with specific proposals."
A Presidency visit that is just contemporary with the General Assembly of the "Crysis Committee", created by the British fishermen to adopt measures to be taken before the prevention of the price of the gas, which has received its record with a average amount of 1,14 euro to litre.
According to Eliseo David Martinon, the President will "debatte with them on possible solutions to help companies to reach competitiveness and to ensure the conditions of work and the retribution of marine."
The fishermen waited for Nicolas Sarkozy and stopped.
Tomorrow, they have been conducted by the "class operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, caused at least 10 km of ingorges.
Even the port of Quiberon was locked, but the connections with Belle Island were not interrupted.
On Quiberon's penisola has been carried out a road block.
Monday the mariners have already proved their determination burning, from alba, pneumatics and palette before the carburant deposits at the Ports of Brest and Lorient, while they took feet demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was exceeded to the Ports of the Atlantic Coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olone, in Vendee, where the fishermen remained on the molo, or to Havre, where a twenty battles have prohibited the movement of the ships from trade.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, near the Atlantic Loira, interrupted the block of the total raffineries of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer, they decided to wait for the meeting that will be married to the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "Crysis Committee" will decide in March the future actions of movement and eventually participation in the meeting set out in the Ministry of Agriculture and Pesca in Paris.
However, some britain fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsibility of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The shooter will continue" because "the fishermen will not fall" and "the fishermen have no intention to marry in Paris", for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Committee of the Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fisheries, which don't pay taxes on the gas, are currently approximately 50 cents per litro, but are stealing that the refund limit of an embarcation is only achieved with a gas low than 0.30 euro.

"All this reports how the market had been counted on the project," added, fearing that for some days it might be already "for too late" to admit one.

Obama advantage to the first twice
After the first debatte between the two candidates in the White House, there is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winter.
Without any surprise, the general quarters of the Republic and Democratic campaign have announced the respective victory of the TV dull, followed by a third of the American family.
The Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's provider, although merciful, wasn't enough brilliant to allow him to cut the chair in five weeks from the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, of which a public opinion of the Sabbath agrees to be a profit of five points to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), shows that the democratic had the best.
A stained song carried by CbsNews on an indecisive electoral campaign, found that 39% of them hold Obama the winter, while 25% points on McCain.
A good prestation from his company of list Joe Biden, waiting during the first and only debate with the rival Sarah Palin, should be confirmed at the jungle of Obama's benefit.
"It would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventh McCain has never stopped to promote its insectable experience in the area of external policy, sublineing the "inutility" of the adversary on the arguments concerned during the first face.
"The Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." He often stated a multiple repression.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the experience and competences necessary to be president."
This from yesterday constitutes a continuous review for the Republic TV campaign.
Obama, from his song, sublineed how his election would present a new future.
No longer, he has shown conscious and needed.
He has promoted its pre-disposition to the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, in contrast to Obama," he repeated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproaching the Republican that he has not adopted the necessary measures to face the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he declared yesterday Obama, before 20 000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a battant rain, for a electoral meeting.
He didn't even speak the words "middle class" or "employees". The financial crisis goes for Obama, considered by the Americans as the most appropriate person to save the economy on the horse of the price.
"The next week may be a decisionful effort," he considered, yesterday, the influence of the democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a member of Clinton's administration, has compared Obama's investment in economic matters as demonstrated by Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidate, the current crowl is "the final green after eight years of the worse economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by the Senator McCain."
With the intention of reducing the taxes for 95% of the Americans in the absence of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned between its priorities to the achievement of an event of energy independence in the country thanks to promote renewable energy and the measuring in a health security system.
McCain, from his song, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres within 2030.
In fact, the two candidates have exposed the incentive issues on the financial safeguard plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euro) adopted last night the Congress and extremely impopular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that the elections were?"
Young and oppositors showed the Sunday evening in the main place of the Bielorruss capital to test the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of bielorussy were gathered tomorrow night after the closed electronic seats in the central station of Minsk to protest the fraudulency character of the legislation.
While the results were still waiting, many young men came to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the ditator, dimissions."
Some confess that they have never voted, "What for? They will do what they will, of my vote," says a boy.
They don't believe that that regime has made a beautiful figure of interest to external observators with the purpose of reviewing dialogue with the European Union is ready to introduce a democratic development.
The sanctions, including the visa division for 40 Bielorussian guidelines and the congelation of goods, may be removed if these elections were legally considered by the observators.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been departed from the electoral committees and our observators have not been able to participate in the field of votes," Jouri Potemkine, the portion of the Union of Democratic Forces, a ethrogenic cohesion of twelve parties.
"It's a change of fata, underlined Alexandre Milinkievitch, an ex candidate of the opposition to the Presidents of 2006 and the pro-European movement, because it's important to calculate the schemes and in this case is the executive.
If the deputy of the opposition come to the Parliament, it is because they have been nominated and not chosen.
But their income to Parliament may be a TV, regional meetings and law proposals."
The opposition is therefore the need to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which is pestly in debt with Russia, enter into crisis, and we do not provoke any reform, we will be a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the ‘organization for security and cooperation in Europe’ which has followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the scrutiny.
Sublines that the participation quotes look too high and that the generalization of the vote in anticipation (26% of the electorers in Minsk) has given the way to every type of manipolation.
"Have you noticed that there were the elections?" Asks the Social Democratic Leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners freed this year in August.
There was no one to the electoral seats.
And there will be at the maximum five deputy of the opposition to the Parliament, the most convenient to the power."
The night silence falls on the place of October.
In television, President Loukachenko and members of the central electoral committee are fulfilled with their success.
Meeting - blood is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the eleventh anniversary of his foundation, and his President, the FrancineDecary, had all the reasons for joy, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
And in particular, he reached the confidence of the public, seriously cut off from the blood scanning infected in the years of 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been infected by the virus of an immunodeficiency (HIV) and the patient C in the 80s.
In the presence of this drama and the protests of the population, the Canadian Government made in February 1994 a public research directed by the Court Horace Krever, which looked to make light on the circumstances that they brought to such tragedy and differing recommendations to prevent the review of a similar disaster.
While the Court Crever had launched a report, some provincies have submitted a committee with the objective of ideaing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was executed by Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two providers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood (Canaday Society of blood) for all other provinces and two territorys.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started his activities, the 38% of the people declared that it would still be confident in Quebec’s donations system, remembered the Dott Decary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continue efforts to improve the safety of blood preliminary and research in the field during the following years, we have reached the confidence of the public," explains that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had now confidence in Hema-Quebec.
The Dott Decary, however, is convinced that "the confidence is something extremely fragile."
Finally, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of prevention.
At the same time, it was in Europe in many cases of the human variation of the smoke, a new demonstration of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's murbo, reporting the coals that is at the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
There are therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Reports of Krever and Gélinau, according to which when they have doubts and could get a serious disease, in this case the mob of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which appears with a degeneration of the brain that brings inevitably to death, are adopted by exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had passed over more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for some years, it has been demonstrated that this disease has been transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us that he had a sense to apply the principle of prevention."
In 1999, a higher efficient technology on the market for HIV-individuation: the tests of nuclear acid (TAN) that allow directly to recognize the presence of the virus and not the anticorps against the same, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, even since the person has contracted the disease in which first virus can be identified in blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to a low period for a week.
The risk to ignore the presence of infected donors and therefore not can't identify them is so decreased.
These improvements have allowed considerably reducing the risk to contrary the AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is the risk of getting blood infected by HIV virus.
"In other words, that means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood campions before someone is infected by HIV virus.
Hema-Quebec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood campaigns, and we will like more than 24 years before a case of HIV is sent with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel quiet in receiving or prescriving a blood transfusion to recover the health, he states the head of the direction of Hema-Quebec.
"Our disaster for the next decade is in keeping our safety of our products.
You don't know what pathogen will be in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the meeting that, as the Western Nilo virus, is transferred to blood from a inset.
It must be constantly watched," the Dott. Decary continues before sublineing that in addition to safe resources Hema-Quebec, Hema-Quebec must also provide enough.
"The needs are increased because the population is old.
With the health against the most aggressive cancer, patients often need a apport of red or plastic balls.
The age of the population has also the consequences of the number of donors that are in the middle of the 3% of the residents of Quebec acceptable as donors."
All health people who have completed 18 years and responding to compliance criteria, however, can give blood every 56 days, in fact six times per year.
In the midst, 14% of the people who are offered as donors are not accepted, because they are struck by AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they have traveled in a country where this last is divorced, they will be rejected for a similar period for a year.
" With this 3% we could keep a inventory able to respond to the needs of the hospital.
Pension cases are very weird.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donors group by hand that they are age and they can't do donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to treat them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today, life is so frenetic that it is hardly one hour to give blood," states Francine Decary desolated.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec distributes not only blood campions, but also human teams, including bones traping, eye-called cardiacs and pelles that are used almost for severe expenditures.
These tests are analyzed, transformed and congelated before they are deposited to Hema-Quebec, which manages the only public bank of the Ombelical Cordone blood in Quebec.
In the ombelical cordon, that once was considered a biomedical scart, a rich blood of staminal cells that can serve to heal severe disease, such as leukemia.
"We have feeded a few weeks ago, the insertion in the bank of our thousands of blood of cordons and we prevent more than thousands of years each year.
The Dott Decary needs that describes this practical practice of blood preliminary of cordon as very popular.
"More moms are deceived that you can't have access," because Hema-Quebec does not have measures necessary to propose this complex and cost programme in all the hospitals of Quebec.

There was a beautiful egg."
Charest Point north
The first Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year.
As concluded the general advice of the Liberal Partie, Jean Charest was held yesterday in Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to take place in the event of party elections today.
"Increase the borders of our last large north: this is the long term of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments from the strong visual impact, in the case of the General Council of the Liberal Partie of Quebec.
After him, during his conversation, the projection of a sort of "Million" images.
On three screens, they were confunded with negative spectaculars of hydroelettrical rings, mineral colts, chebec images seeing with "Google Maps", cartine, etc.
Great measures like in full electoral campaign.
During the print conference, the first Minister refused to exclude the launch of urban elections, even if he had noticed that he was very engaged.
The "Pano North" is the fourth point of a "project" which the first Minister states to have for the Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on the manufacture, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent discussions of the first Ministry, the opening of the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - has never been subjected to a presentation.
However, the first Minister has been limited to explain why the North would be "a joy of the great potential," but it has not been spoken about tempests or investment quotes, as well as he has not explained what priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
In addition, it has been limited to reporting what its advice provides a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but in particular the minerary sector, which, after the growth of the emergency countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructures, has experienced various improvements.
Standing on Charest styled list, the North contains "nyel, zinc, rame, platin, gold, silver, yellow, titan, and even diamants."
This "the big territory is the double of France", it's here, it's the Quebec.
It's not just here, but it's insected in us," he insisted, as he wanted to celebrate a national funder.
The foundations of Quebec are radicated in his relationship with the North, he sublined: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Baia of James.
"Speak to us, it's our future," added, after a teatrale pause to look at the cartina emergency at its skins.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of the Labrador that the Quebec has always reviewed, needed the first minister in the press conference.
"It's a traditional position maintained by all governments.
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity is present, I will replace that position in the name of the government."
From the rest," considering the climate changes, you need to evaluate the North," he stated by talking about the past of the North-west, which will be opened for the whole year because of the shooling of the eggs.
In this new geopolitic context, the first Minister estimates that the territory is a debt."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first Minister stated that the Government of Quebec would be very careful and that the project would go to their interests, especially the young people.
Two ex-ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Letourneau (ex-deputed of the PQ of Hungary) have already given the way to consult a thirty community.
An interministry committee adopted by Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Traports and Natural Resources) worked an important charge, has started work.
The first Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "the common visions will be given"
The North Development will come from the rest to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Piano will be "concerted, ordered and respected the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with the first liberal ministers who have before it.
"As the liberals that have been before us, we know distinguishing us to transform disagreements in new times of growth and development."
This was lowly one of the recurrent issues of the weekend, which was started with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to repeat the Central Beauharnois in Diga Adelard-Godbout.
"A Godbout, the Creator of Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage that nationalized hydroelectricity, in Bourassa, the Creator of Baia James, our party has always heard forget the future," said Jean Charest.
During the print conference, it is recognized to another reference, conservator this time, the program "Rue to the north" of John Diefenbaker, first Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Confronting the project relating to Eastmain1a-Ruper Hydroelectric Degree, Charest needed that its in function would be provided for 2012.
"All this remains among us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed his soldiers, raising feelings applauded.
In fact, the first minister, which in April said, would not have been elections in 2008 and, likewise, even in 2009, has not disappeared the possibility of starting a surrounding scrutiny, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It is underlined to be sure very engaged, in particular in a mission of the federal Council in China and in the summit of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend has provided the liberal capital a platform of national resolutions, especially the "constitutional aspirations" which have passed as the oil: the PLQ rejects particularly the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that the Quebec's names of the Council's radiodiffusion and the Canadian telecommunications and that these recently have a right to vote on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As regards the opposition, the North Piano abbot was accepted in scetical ways.
The Leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has repaired the North Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to the Liberal Government, in 2003, it would not have respected the application.
If we had done it, we would have been progressed today" he commented the Marois at least the candidate of Jean-Talon (scrutiny today), Francoise Mercure.
The ADQ declared to support the adoption of the North Piano by the Government.
"It's what we're arrogant, it's that all this is not simplely perceived as a spectacle," commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, in the same day from the vacances.
Letter - A Desolated country
It was Vic Toews, an ex-minister of "Justicia" (Ironian of the sort) of the Harper's office, to allow you to state, the last, that Louise Arbor was a "good" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who has struggled immediately for righteousness and that is worthy of all our admiration says that it is very much in the area of the first Ministry, even on the same Stephen Harper.
This is the only government, among all the west-related countries, who have not repaired a citizen held in the field of concentration of Guantanamo.
A government who doesn't have anything in consideration the fact that Omar Khadr was a simply adolescent at the time that the immune facts have occurred.
The only government that, although he signed the Geneva Convention, rejects his word and lets march a child sold in unhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the crime of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, International Amnesty, and the Order of Canadian lawyers, in particular, call the relief of Omar Khadraffin, that may be submitted to a regular process in Canada.
It's exactly the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it's very much important that a young adult is now mentally destroyed, maybe forever, after many years of supply.
It is not yet aware of it, but we are assisting an insultable erosion of our rights, freedom and democracy, saying that Harper does not stop stealing and sounding so intensely on his labs.
Here we arrived when there is no more moral: you can distract, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a governor cap to today to minority (as see what will be after 14 October...).
Many electors believe that a party that preaches the Virtu, the Respect of the Law and the Order who represent salvation: they don't see that this government has renounced the reputation and the dignity of our country.
It's just the crazy here, sir. Toews, in the reputation of all this, and from no other part.
Free opinion - The orwellian talk of Barrick Gold
In the edition of 17 September, the Devoir has published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mineral Company Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, this last states that the largest aurifery company of the world has traveled a cheer for divorce from six millions against three authors and a small editorial house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a divorce, and well the law.
Without any surprise, this sustainable difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public debate would be bringing to the robbery whoever feels supporting a contrary position to her.
It does not matter the outcome of the process, the writers and the editor of the Canadian Book Black will have to spend a cospital sum of money to organize their own defense and fight, with a decisively learned army against an army of lawyers financed by the boards without the fund of the minerary company.
On the other hand, in these weapons of weapons, the tattoo is often to break the agreement in order to impose a consensual regulation that makes him an occasion but to fear everyone who hears to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it would be interested in the public opinion that would have been presenting its vision of facts.
In contrast to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, the discussions in Canada are normally implemented by the change of opinions and not by the smoking of manage.
So it would be sufficient that the company opened its books, its documents, and established a real and very discussion, through day, media, publication and funding of independent research teams that would have been able to make light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too confidence in the public thinking and reject the requests and letters to support the authors of Canada Black.
Maybe Garver may explain how to ask a public debate when its disregard for the same public is very clear?
In the world of the Vice-President, this word seems to be indicated exclusively to the lawyers paid, not to the Same of Canadians; this is a very restrictive vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have been right to speak.
What the Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Canada Black makes it first because he refuses the brutal measures adopted by the minerary company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil changes of thinking, and not in the attic of what many understand as a kind of imbawalling (recertaining the "public debate", Barrick Gold just gave the authors of Canada Black a last inquired them to suspend the use of that word...)
From there of the surreal talk of Garver, the desire of supporting from Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack to university research freedom and the persecution of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to the citation of authenticative sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada is impossible to study and discuss arguments about the most rich enterprises of the world, who can do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do it following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black.
He's right to replicate.
Since long, the university environment, from which we are part of, is able to handle discussions and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold show clearly that, in contrast to its prices, it does not look forward to a transparent debate.
This is going to escape from the university world, as it is the same public debate in Canada, and now the governments approve the measures to be limited to abusive desires.
Operation - Saving for Wall Street – Republic and Democratic dialogue
The Government of Bush and the Captains of the Congress, representatives of the Republic and Democratic Armagement, have finally come to a agreement on the greatest safe-finance plan after the Great Depression of 30 years.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars, which looks forward to the financial crisis in Wall Street, must still be ratified from the two rooms of the Congress.
It provides particularly: check on its efficient sentence by the elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reward of the public money, new provisions to contain the number of penalty houses for missing payments, as well as a right of inspection on the retributions paid to the managers of the total companies.
The American Secretary-General in Tesoro, Henry Paulson, President of the representative room, Nancy Pelosi and the representative republished on the table of the Treaty, Senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news a few minutes after half night, last night, at the end of a long-term treaty maratone.
"We have done great progress in view of an effective agreement on the market," said the representative of Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"Any decision has been taken in such a way to save the economy and the American people from the crisis currently in Wall Street.", he explained the democratic.
"It's the crucial point: if we have not been acting in this way, unvaluable distress and distress would be turned back to the day life of the Americans," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the Treaty was marked by concerns on the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed limit time corresponded to the opening of markets this morning.
The United States later to the Treaty, the two candidates to the American Presidents have been most favorable to the agreement, however, without prejudice to express their disagreements to the adoption of external solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama will be intended to have added some provisions to the Agreement, in particular that will allow the owners to keep their home and the inheritors to the retributions destined to the managers of enterprises carried out from the State.
"When the contributors are requested to adopt extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to join.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote for the plan, his revolutionary advocator, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope yes."
"When I read, it's something we all have to say, and it will allow us to go forward."
The option of a non-intervention is just inacceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is to reach the money of the contributors the duty credits, the risk and non-profit efforts of the US financial institutions.
The plan has arrived after 14 months of crisis due to the exploitation of an immobiliar ball that has first carried into the cross of the risk hypothesis credits (mutiu) , to expand other shapes of credit tickets (PCAA) and to shoot in the congelation of liquidity and the loss of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of republics in charge to send the first project of an agreement last week.
It seems that they were gone out of that white cycle since the demokratics accepted that the "toxic" active of some disease companies is only toiled by the government, just as they acquired.
In order to meet all, to the Congress, it has been added a provision in which, if the Government had to face losses during the five years to come for that programme, it could offer new taxes to maintain its balance.
The new plan prevents the verse of a first 250 billion dollars to which they can add more than 100 billion if the President repeats it necessary.
The verse of 350 billion should be ratified by another vote of the Congress.
Instead of its assistance, Washington will open party quotes in total enterprises that will be shared in the case of benefits and that will be reached when the waters will be calm.
As set out by the plan, the federal Government will have the possibility to launch the procedures for the immobiliar presence and to establish limits to the reward and the indents to the leaders of the companies concerned.
Since today, the architectures of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives , and to the vote of the Senate marketed.
Nevertheless all the efforts, it is not yet sure that the free way comes to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, even in the revolution and democratic army.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't feel you," said to his electorers, the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Committee of the Camera.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But it is not certain to apply contributors..
Leader of a small group to the Congress submitted "the caucus of the scettis," the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in different ways, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Firty hundred major economy teachers, including three Nobel Premi, have written us to say, "We ask the Congress that we don't carry out degrees and consider the way to take."
At the same time, in Europe, it was again at the test of the world's nature of crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benelux announced the Partial Nationalization of the Fortis Bank Group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary when the French BNS Paribas had made known that he would have renewed its competitor's acquisition, in full fall after the loss of 2 billion euros (2,9 billion dollars) for the risk of immobiliar immobiliar prestitis in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 dependents and is part of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the ten larger insurances.
"It's not the Persian money, he told the Netherlands Minister of Finance, Wooder Bos.
As a result, the impact and vote rights are received in the bank issues.
It's certainly something that repairers and families appreciate now that times are announced uncertainly."
During this period, in the other outside of Manica, the British government seems to be able to nationalize another billing bank for financial crisis.
According to the English pressure, the government would be carried out of the summary of the prestitis currently at the Bradford and Bringley bank, which is more than 41 billion (75,5 billion dollars) of immobiliar premises.
The Spanish bank Santander has noticed yesterday that you will buy the fuusures and the accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, a nationalization process from the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an empiricial icon
The beauty from the eye of the eye was for a long time his ass in the manica, for others its deep point.
Have he been free from the narcistic speech, the American actor from the ammalian summer?
Yeah and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have issued him from that role of powers sanctified to true and their sacred monsters.
But what cost!
Paul Newman, lost Friday, at the age of 83, in his ranch of Connecticut, after a cancer at the polmone, remains one of the last American cinematics of the fast years.
Nearly monumental of Brando, which he liked and was a long-term kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also brings freedom and development of dramatic convinces.
The mixed boys often born magic kids.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from the Hebrew father of German and the mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots, one of the visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, the last character of quality.
Because in him all an invaded country of the safe man, the fighter of the Pacific War, weared in battle, that at the beginning of the 50 years he studied dramatic arts in Yale, then the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing the teatro, in television and fast at the cinema.
The same military man for civil rights was also the automobilist pilot that was classified in 1979 in the 24 hours of Mans, and six symbols, even part of a model model from 1958 with the attorney Joanne Woodward.
If they go with him the shadow areas of a reserved star, discreted, emphasized, allergic to the show-business scans, which will never be able to light the mystery completely.
A honourable man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend, Paul Newman's loss was a thief in the heart for the cinefiles, while his great persons people the black screen of memories.
More than half century American cinema in full transformation replaces through its interpretations.
They confunded the famous cow-boy of Butch Cassidy(1969) and that boy is incapable of desire the focosa wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The gate on the tea that was approved by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Recently, we remember it in the minds of Mr. Bridge (1990), a married marriage who does not keep as promised.
So many other Paul Newman have passed in the history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassù somebody loved me, Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean and rejected after his death, which was officially launched by Newman in 1956.
That bad sympatic lives in the great Stangata, Oscar as a best film in 1973.
biliardo billard and vended player in Lo Spaccone, great film of Robert Rosen (1961), the color of the money of Martin Scorsese, which is worth in 1987 the only gascar on 9 nominations.
That look through the years, it was his.
He's still.
Times have passed through their path.
Young people know it, especially for the Slap Shot- Colpo film cult, sequence of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, a hokey team on little ortodose ice.
His fans found him in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the brothers Coen in 1994.
The circle was closed with a last role from the father of the Irish mafia in It was my father in 2003.
In the absence of the most degrees reading of the cinema that had left the officer fast, Newman will remain long in the sales, declaring Hollywood in all his shirt, party and concesions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cinematcher, defined it, with a point of ironia, "a living disagreement at overplaying," judged his benefits.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, where the roles seemed to fall as a manna from heaven.
However, he often prefered the role of the emergency to the young actor: nerotic persons, alcoholed carones or desperts, of which he expressed disappearance and rebellion with his perfect treatments.
As registered, Newman discovered unknown sfumature of his real, he could have sensitivity.
The first time of Jennifer, from 1968 (based on the romance of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, tracked a soil female retreat of Melanconia.
He, who lost the son of Scott for a overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Without the unnumerable weapons yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old friend Robert Redford (which were receipt together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with unfinite sorrow" His presence made my life and this best country."
Genesis and love for life, two big characteristics of the lost actor.
From there of a lawyer carrier, there is a great military for civil rights, the environment, the independent cinema, a protester of Hollywoodiana devotion.
We have broken her face to smoke on acid, sals, biscots and other foods, judgeing her a bad choice of pleasure, although she was born as a gas.
However, the income of those solds were assigned to its Fund for Children in Difference.
Newman, instead of getting on his mixture, he chose to work until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said, "Always until the end, your father was incrediblely recognised at his good star .
It was a privilege."
And further, it was priority for us to follow the path of a American artist so clean and generous.
They cited the model, so, and much more.
What was produced in Zusfeld & society factory?
At least, on 8 October, the audience of the criminal process against Janos Zusfeld and society will be discussed.
The political man and his society are accused of reiterated trade frauds in the context of a criminal association that caused fair damage, and other reacts, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Research, the money received by concurrent bands was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the effectiveness of the activities through false factors.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million floors, has been completed in part in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, in particular in the tables of some people.
According to the method, noted by the competent authorities, they have provided the money received by concurrent bands based on factors for nonexistent operations and associations have never been fulfilled by the competent obligations.
According to the accusation act, a large part of the factors was false.
In order to make them the fatture blocks were buyed on the market of Josesefváros, the circle timbers were made in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on the name of what you say to eject the fattures, it was established among the other during the gite between the collines above Balaton where Janos Zusfeld had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of this last, he had to choose the pensions and restaurants.
He asked the facture for consumptions, on the models of these then, the factors were prepared to enter the concurrent bands, among others, the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Working and Social Affairs and the Community of Budapest.
Many of these are operating in Isván Lados and Andras Strari, which, according to our information, has reformed the necessary relations to get finances.
One of the choices of the "training studies" of Lados was a birreria.
According to the two factors of Zusfeld and society in 2003, the restauration location has made a group of 90 persons of the Association Vistos Pont Einesület.
But so many people, according to the repository, would not all enter together into the local.
Similarly, the fatture is issued in the state of 2002 to the Job Foundation for the future, then named Contributed to Thirmadik Evezred, formal and content errors.
A pension of Badacsonytomai has only three rooms, more than 10 people couldn't lose us, however in the fatture were 130 hotels.
But the compilators of the full fantasy fattures have exagerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., and this is also occupied of restauration, in which accountability - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even figure documents in name of Job Jövõ and Hoppá.
The Guest Farkas, the manager of the company, told the hvg.hu that when it was called in search and showed the factures, he immediately understood that it was false documents.
"Besides the name and the Iva game of our business were found in a wrong point."
He added: Furthermore, formal reasons did not return even the fact that, according to the fatture, hundreds of people were logged, when in total there are ten rooms and there are no so many rooms.
To come the fatture was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer working.
The compilators of factors were not concerned to notify that the Budapest Agency traveling from their elections, organize only travelways outside, so they have noticed on the facture with a payment of traveling in Hungary, which does not agree with the practice of factory emissions of the society.
Furthermore, as demonstrated during the investigation, Iva also figured, while the travel activity to countries outside the European Union is existing Iva.
On the other hand, the import of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Revfülù Kft. for the foundation of Job Next, because on the services offered by the company must apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the factors, and also the hotel dependents emited only printed factors, while the factory was written in hand.
Furthermore, the "emitteds" have broken other factors, in the case of a dining, they have indicated as a work of the market transport on the road, as it comes to know the procedure of the Research, activity that was not implemented by the company based originally by investment consultation.
Furthermore, for formal difects - causes fatture non-compatible, false member - has been discovered that fattures have been brought to use for Third Evezred Standard, XXI. Szazadi Cultural Unit and Of course Points are false.
The same happened in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfehloon, which representatives denied the facts of the question.
The falsificators did not even attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) planted you a group of Fiatal Város Onesület for that reason, according to our information, he refused that he had sent that factor.
They have made fatures consciously
Another group of fatture emissions is constituted by those who were conscious to emerge fatties.
The foundation Esely Budapest for The Standard has issued a fatture on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialists for the foundation Content in Harmadik Evezred for almost 4 million floors.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the imputates, according to the accusation act, has persuaded the Director of Collab Kft. to emerge fishing fattures.
He also collaborated with the Susulat and society, also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which has provided fattures for a value of about 5 million floors to the foundation of Job Next, the Association of Atlasz Unisület and the Association of Forest-Unisuelet, after which there was no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money because the prepared factors were then stored, but the associations forgot to figure this aspect in their own documents.
In the next group of released fattures are those connected to the imputates.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised to the capture of the General Director of Delta Trio Kft, with a seat in Budapest but not reperable there, which is busy of combustible and carrier trade.
The payment has released several factors in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of information measures, for a value of about 18 million floors.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas has buyed these factors since 14 September 2005.
The General Director of this vote was a Romance between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would invoke the documents on the payment.
As we know Kubatov, during the investigation, he recognized that he had released fattures in the name of the society to the Atlas, Hoppá and Onewitt in Harmadik Evezred, and the contractor was made by him.
On the expression request of Ivan Kubatov, Roman walls founded Fa-Bani society Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the debt was operational because, according to the imputation, they did not have received a job.
However, the companies have been useful because on the request of advocate Zsolt Santen, editor of the funding documents of society, in the name of the statements have been released fats to the associations associated with Zuspot: at Atlash and Y-generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has released to various entities 15 factors for a total value of 14,2 million floors.
The search believes that Kubatov has insert 10% of the imports indicated on fattures and Iva.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to emerge fattures, manufactured for the Wittos Pont concurrence band.
Y-generation and Treaty for Modern Hungary in January 2006 have submitted a band for the public use of the Social Partie, Tancsics Mihály Based (TMA).
They also win 500,000 flowers in head but the sums were not used for the objectives indicated in the band.
Before this came not to gas, they presented the TMA five fattures received by Works Team Kft.
These factors were found during the investigation of the office of Arpád Kemecsí at the Ministry of Public Education.
In the hearing of a part of the inputs, as they have already been investigated, they will probably refer to the production of factors.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the imputed number one, Janos Zusfeld, would decide to pull the ball over all.
His confession has not been very detailed and even if he promised to talk about everything exhaustly, he has not yet done it.
It should be considered if it's in its interest, it may also give that socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which - in the change of a resort of 50 million flowers, a large part of the wound - would have been ready to make the experiency hair.
It would also have been able to violate himself since its requests to enhance its prison conditions, which is the authorisation of home arrests, have not yet been found.
While the authors of non-reservable commercial reactions and caused worries may be freely passed or at least waiting at home at the end of the procedure against them, what is not accepted to him.
The psychology of licitar in exceedingly: why to spend more money?
In the case of the purchases, the markets are proposed to spend more, to overcome the market.
Neurological and economic researchers of the University of New York have been achieved to discover the neuro-economic bases of this noted and apparently irrelational.
According to their study appeared on the Science review, men don't want to stay back in a garage, such as the eBay state, so they are available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to track the nervous scheme of this "party" at the level of the nervous system through experimental.
A group of volunteers played at the lot, the other group of players participated in one stage while with the method of magnetic resonance (fMRI) have examined the active areas of the brain of participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the game of the state, where the substance is to licite more than the other, the body stripped under the brain cortection enters intensely in function when it loses the game.
This cerebral area, besides other functions, plays a role in the mechanism "autogratification" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price raised is explained with the exhaust reaction of the striated body.
In order to support their theory, the economics of the research group have made a financial investigation.
Three groups in this investigation have relied against a partner in various circumstances.
The control group reported how much was the real value of the product concerned and they made their points.
To another group more than this, they have promised that in the case of winning they will receive another price of $15.
However, the third group would have received 15 dollars before the state, but the members of the group would have lost the money in case of loss.
The difference between the two groups was the fact that for one of them the winning was underlined, while for the other, the loss.
Checking the neurological hypothesis the members of the group that played "beside the loss" were prepared to make higher points of the control group or "vincent".
"These results are not deductive by no of the existing economic theory before.
For these facts still explained the phenomenons that were involved with the joy of winning and the loss of risk.
Only the neurological images have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theory, so that we are coming to a third interpretation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Economic Faculty of New York University.
Epatite: When do you call to the doctor?
At least half billion people in the world suffer cronic epatites B or C, in Hungary, instead of the first causes of death are reported to chronic epatics.
In Hungary, the number of epatite diseases mounts to centomoil, these are only 7000: the reason is that many diseases do not know that they are contacted.
The epatite definition is the collective name of epatite epatite diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many comparisons between symptoms, typically they are epatite and energy, but their pathogen agents and disease are different from each other.
The viruss of the epatite are divided in two main forms according to the pathogen agent: the epatite A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), the epatite B, C, D and the other virus with blood and organic liquids (sperma, vaginal loss, salva).
For whose travel is useful to vaccin against virus A and B, against C there is no vaccin.
The symptoms of the epatite A shown two-3 weeks after the consumption of infected foods, associated with general disease, disease, addominal pains and nausea.
After forming yellow skins on the skin and on the white eyes, the fats become clear and the dark urine, the guarantee happens in two-year-old weeks.
One million of people die every year in the world for the epatite B, the most serious variation of the disease, which causes to humor to fegate and epatic cirrus.
The main reason is, according to the meanings, that only one person on ten receives a pharmacological treatment.
Even the patient C may have very serious consequences: if it is not healed can cause epatic circles and humor to fegate.
Most of the infectious people don't know that the disease has been contracted because pathogen agents have destroyed the epatic cells, in many cases the first symptoms are coming after 20 to 30 years.
So it is very important to prevention and effectiveness of regular medical analysis.
This disease is very frequenter than the media in three groups: who had a blood transfusion before 1991, the toxic dependents and the tatuates.
In the world to today the number of people infected by the cronic epatite C is amounted to 200 million.
Because also a test of routine laboratory shows that the disease is the penalty to react to the family doctor when any symptom of unknown origin is noted.
Recognised in time the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the organism, so he stops the infectious power and can be prevented by the training of humor.
The 30 September is the world day of epatite, organized for the first time in 2004 throughout the world of disease associations.
The goal is to request the attention of the viral cronical epatite, the causes of its development and precoces recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith works as a species of analgesic that has caused the death of Catholic marriages more sustainable.
The scientists of Oxford University have conducted an interesting experience, considering how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, has communicated the British Telegraph.
In the field of the most bizarre investigation, an electroshock was made to 12 Catholic faiths and to other acts, while all who observed a rafffiguring design of Mary's virgin.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to respirate a large part of the pain.
Thanks to the explosive technology of human brain was discovered that Catholics were able to active the part of the responsible brain control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which more than the academics also share scientists, philosophy and theologists of the University.
The test was just thus executed: a tool that carries and passes the electroshock has been linked to the left hand of the subject of the experience.
Researchers asked the participants to concentrate on two dinings, the sister Mary depicted in the XVII century from Sassoferrato and Dama with the hermelin of Leonardo da Vinci in the XV century.
The authors of the test hoped that the image of the virgin Mary was originating a sort of religious state between the believers, while Leonardo's frame was chosen because he was not too different from the other and had a quiet effect.
The subjects of the experiment have passed half hours before the MRI scanner and in this time area have received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while they observed or the design on religious subject or the other.
The Catholics have mentioned that the vision of the virgin Mary has made them feeling "security", as if "anybody had care" of them and "they are quiet and were lost from peace."
In view of the image of religious subjects, they have taken account of 12% in less of pain in respect to when they had the work of Leonardo before themselves.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part of himself in the test, believes that such results can be achieved with any image from the strong effect of the attacks, but you need to find the correct image.
"We have to look for a picture to which they used very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," he said the psychologist.
The Anglicano Tom Wright has been comforted with the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - added Wright.
After the best results remains only the question if the believers are presented to the believers the design of a madonna of Leonardo or another pitcher of such calibration, which could be the effect on the control of pain?
The vision of a girl Maria of quality would bring better results?
You're what you're saying about yourself
On the tenth day of the complementary day, Google can say that they are such as in the boards of people and in the sky above their heads; he knows where they have passed vacances, which frequency ambulance and what they interest.
But this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the district, is not enough yet.
Instead of the scects that make a paragon with the orwellian incubo, they do not see exactly the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data from its users and this is necessary to wait for the original goal of Google Foundations that was: "Let's insert in a system all the world's information!".
According to the Director of Google interviewed the payment, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of manage all information.
At the question, what happens between five years Schmidt, he would like if Google would like to answer questions as "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What would the job be appropriate for me?" but the software can't answer to a simple question because they don't know enough of users.
Not all the internals are known that during their search on the Internet, the searched words are exactly registered, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested ones are stopped after the search.
By the Personalized Search Launch two years ago, users can remember their browser history, they can look at what they have searched and clicked, these later will generate results on very better measures; on the same logical recommendations, with which the system offers us products and services based on our previous preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me, if they look at what I'm busy? - The worried users ask Google's data monopolie.
In most cases, the controversy of the internal persons are caused by the fear of the potential power represented by the tribute , and not for the meaning of sin, for fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or addition for rebellion to the power.
However, a fact is confirmed and that all searched expressions are not only registered but in motivated cases can also be given to third, in such legal cases nothing protects the internal personal rights.
The most exciting example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against the pedofiles of Brazil, in which Google has introduced the Brazilian government the information that have made possible to identify pedofiles from the Google community's page of Orkut.
However, the internal concerns for personal rights were subject to concern at May when the deputy - agreed with the EFF legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: yet, you can not cost Google with no point of the constitution to provide any information required secretly by the FBI.
(In the same time, the federal government has successfully broken about 50,000 web addresses and thousands of research expressions related to the confirmation of the law of child protection previously approved years, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the whole list of web pages and key words corresponding to two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore very contradictionary: those who fear to provide their personal data sphere Google because they believe that it's so attracted their intimate scene and private life starting to use the services and seek the rebellion spreading to multinationals that spread for the conservatory image.
At the same time, the American geek culture and the proliferation of applied, activists and users of the computer compared in many countries see the future generation of the big states, the "cool corporation" against their rival, the Microsoft liquided as conquistator of the world because of Windows, as both they fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, in different ways of Microsoft, does not ask your users a identifier code, does not ask money for their own services, the source code always updated and the software package is much more accessible, younger and cool of the official practice of the software colosure.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and Internet, which is just one of the key words that are often repeated in the last years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 does not talk about other than the cooperation, to leave tracks behind us and to use communicative channels to our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show us yourself.
A young media can create profiles in more communities, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm which lists their musical goods, all these can insert them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also write blogs on which your most recent photo gallery appears automatically on Flickr or Picasa.
However, we read many examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos scattered in the morning from the common tour of friends, is easy to know with who has passed through the night his loss of the boy or a dining can leave her dependent because he wrote a true opinion on the company: one thing is safe, the private life concept now is completely reviewed.
Who lives a online life makes a way to show yourself and so we can form the basic teas that are hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Whoever wants to hide something or just wants to prevent the Google monopolis can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using the Google search system but that at the same time does not leave volontarially tracks).
There are no longer people who do not register for Community pages to not be found, on-line applications of Google, from the development of texts to the image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not connected to greater server parks and that does not compose our best profile until existing.
The public opinion waits not even in secret the moment when Google will cut out the articles.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion value value more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the public spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of public agencies, the income services in record time cause great worries not only to Microsoft but also to many stated software developments.
However, critical observators nearly all this are aware of alarming points: for example, the company's highlight, for example, has completely refused the protection of the dependents after he had ratified the right of the business asylum, has considered too costly the repeat to join the diary of dependents, but all this declines before the fact that in 2006 Google has thrown the Chinese Government head in 2006, and in view of their agreement, all the results that have violated the good pleasure and interests of the Chinese system.
A internal rule of the dite seems to not publish a new service in anticipation, but only when it is useful, one thing is sure, that the preventive problems of the next months and years will remove the world in a point: while some think that the project of scannering and archiving books and reviews of Google will assume these proportions that the tattoo will be quickly found before the Supreme Court of the United States, others have fear of the Health system, of fact that we can create our sanitarian profile with our references, medical and problems.
The fact that Google is built a genetic base date can offer good materials to the next generation of fancy writers, the Scroogled report of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian accommodations, in which a man with Google data can be closed as an alarm.
Two minors helped Ozd's duplicate killer to shoot the tracks
The police asked two minors about the double murder of Ozd, who were subject to the basis of helping to shoot the tracks of crime - he stated marted the portrait of the Police Question of Borsod region.
Youths have recognised their reputation, currently accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls, according to the information of the MTI, are protected freely.
The favorite is punishable until 5 years of reclusion.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year man of the place, was set in preventive prison.
It's suspected of premedied murders to win.
From the investigation, the young man had a big debt with a 53-year man.
The suspect did not want to solve the debt, therefore the last market has attacked his believer in a song of Ozd where he killed him and the daughter of nine years.
According to the information of the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he did the murder with a hidden weapons on the place.
The police examines the weapons and circumstances of use with the impact of an expert.
The Borsa of Varsavia has made a offer for the purchase of Praga Borsa
The Borsa values of Varsavia offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion of Czech corners, for the acquisition of 100% of the list of the Borsa Actions of Praga.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warsavian Borsa, confirmed the advanced offer by the Polands, although the cheeks had been excluded before Warsavian Borsa as possible acquired of the Force of Praga.
The reason of exclusion is the fact that the Varsavian Borsa is a property of the state.
The 99% of the actions is in hand to the Poland State who wants to sell in a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech Financial Daily E15 states that the offer of the Poland represents the highest increasing number for the Prague Borsa.
According to the Czech Press Finally, they presented a offer of the Vienna Borsa, the transatlantic Borsa Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the Borsa of London and the German Borsa.
Peter Koblic, Director of the Borsa values of Praga, stated the past week that among all interested in Varsavian Borsa would be the worst owner and didn't exclude that it could bring it into the future to the closement of the Borsa of Praga.
Market experts estimate the value of the Force of Praga in 5-10 billion coron.
According to the Agreement of Actionists, at least 90% of the titles would be sold.
The largest owner of the Borsa of Praga is the Patria Finance with a cost of almost 25%, followed by the Czech Bank with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.l. with 13,5%
Economic crisis from the view of European Journals
The main European journals in their comments of March for the international economic crisis are already talking about "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has been made thanks to the President of the United States - accuses the Republic - which has not been able to compatible its party behind a law abhorred in a very quickly, which is the objective to remedie to a disastered situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as he said the superfinger of the billionary Warren Buffett, it would be more exact to talk about a second 11 September.
A part of Madrid's printing is also seeing the experiency hair in Washington.
According to El World, the missing American political guidance has thrown the world economy on the ground of the barater.
It increases the risk of the roll of the American financial system and it will suffer it after all the world.
The Bush plan was not perfect, but according to the vote of the Congress is the danger that Washington will not offer a political measure for the management of the crisis.
The world's economy is suspended in air, just when the greatest transformation of capitalism history is implemented.
It isn't more possible to lose the worst - accurate the Days-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some have been today can still offer a saving cup to barcoling financial institutions and with the money of contributors can save them from falling.
But if banks are always crollaneous as a master effect, then they will not be enough or the financial measures or new unseen solutions.
For a long time, the Member States of the European Union have to exceed their national egoism and concentrate the control of the remindered financial markets.
Only on Monday, the undeparted financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - remember the future Der Standard, as they always seem to be more real as the European contributors, such as the Americans, should be put into their portfolio to repeat the crisis.
The EU has never been worried about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
"Salvators" should not immediately evacuate the 100 billion euros, however, it would be better if they were established in which case it is necessary to touch the money of the contributors to prevent greater damage.
The smart machine impresses the calabrone flight
What could be the best way to develop anticollision technology if you do not imitate the sensors of the residues that are in nature?
For example, the apics.
In the surprising project presented to the CEATEC in Japan, the calabroni gave the initial strategy to the Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anticollision systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokio la Nissan built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotized miniat of the properties of api, with the final purpose of creating a system to escape all collisions.
In volding the apics form a personal oval space that really likes our protective scudo - explained to Kazuhiro Doi, Director of the PR Technology and research and development.
It is important to be the role of the spectrum, the capacity of a visibility of 300 degrees in every direction.
Ingegners have attacked the laser telemeter idea to copy the function of the spectrum.
The BR23C rejects the rests to two meters distance within a range of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the border microprocessor that transforms it immediately into a command to prevent collision.
In a fraction of the robot understood the steel and then, following the movements of the ape, changes immediately by rotating the roads of the necessary measure to prevent the accident.
This evacuation manufacturer, in different ways of the current system, is conducted in the way of all the active.
"If it wasn't so the robot car couldn't react quickly to prevent collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratorio Mobility and the robot project.
This technology must be reacted essentially and immediately because it corresponds to the worse and more internal straight of the protective scudo, within which the collision is currently considered unevitable.
The whole process must repeat what a ape does to avoid the other ape.
This process must be carried out in an eye battery.
But in different ways, the deviation cannot go to high or low, or in diagonal, can only be bidimensional and in the direction of steerability of the roads.
Instead of the unfinished opportunities to dispose of api to scan others, the robot, as a possibility of disposal, can rotate on itself, accelerate and raise.
The BR23C is carried out by battery to litio polymers, more reader and higher energy density, which means that their duration is greater than those of litio ions.
According to Andoh, it is important to the presentness of intellectual reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must develop some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous hand data, so use only a few decades of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte memory or Megabyte.
This is the first step to development of a technology for immediate evacuation of collisions which, prevented by Nissan, can be installed within 10 years on series vehicles.
Additional application opportunities can be represented by unification with satellite GPS navigation system that disappears the obstacles present on the road to destination.

The written version of the Economic Safety Act was updated from 700 billion dollars for the acquisition of unproportioned credits, to apply in more parts.
In the first past, the half of the sum is exposed.
In the new protested agreements until the midnight of Saturday, according to the East Coast, the leaders of the Congress have decided to save the plan of 700 billion dollars after a debate that was a day - she reported to Reuters.
We have accomplished several steps before - he stated Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Representative Chamber, according to which it was left only to put the agreement on the letter.
In addition to the candidates to the President, Barack Obama and John McCain, they supported the plan's commitment.
The Ministry of the Dear Henry Paulson talking about the result of the compromise has stated: The programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. Second Pelosi is not the saving of Wall Street, but the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was published before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 seconds of Washington's hour (2 of the Sunday night after the Central Europe), but it has not brought a large growth of bottles.
On Monday, the Chamber of the Representatives will vote first the draft defining economic stabilisation law of 2008 on the programme, afterwards to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke on the Sunday with the Pelosi, and then he accepted the news of the agreement in the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress arrived tonight and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect the economy - said Tony Fratto's Portvoce of the White House.
However, the programme is different from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which prevented that 700 billion dollars would be all exposed for the acquisition of the titles with non-profit credits.
Now as the first step can be spend at the maximum half of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Monday vote of the Congress, with these the Ministry of the Tesoro will buy tickets with non-profit credits, of the kind of remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the President.
A special college will control the programme in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the other half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of the Tesoro may apply a combinated tattoo: it can buy credits, hypothecs and titles with hypothecs and other types of credits "avoided".
The purchases may come through aside and directly - they have announced competents of the ministry.
The legal rules makes possible for the interested statements to take part in a secure programme where the Ministry of the Tesoro guarantees the measures that are concerned, for which companies will pay a suitable price to the potential assessment.
Henrz Paulson said: The law gives the measures necessary to get 700 billion dollars for the urgent requirements of the US monetary system, which are achieved from the acquisition of wrong financial measures, or their assurement, or to prevent the risk of a large financial institution.
We will make all the necessary steps to find us ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and in waiting for the State Aid think that the Government will limit their goodness, defined by the slang of the orange, just as gold paracadutes.
The restrictions of payments will be only in some cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of the Conservation will provide the aid.
In substance, the limitation means that if the Ministry will acquire in the area of a state, he will put a surface on the gold paracadute, if they will not send the decadute bank director in pension.
The Government will be in a aggressive way to ensure that the money of the directors will not be exhausted.
It adds that already existing contracts of gold paracadute will not change, the limit is only valid for news to incentive the participation to the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limit on the retribution of general managers - he commented the Democratic Barney Frank President of the Committee on Financial Services of the Representative Chamber.
Furthermore, it has the right to apply a quote of the banks participants to the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, since, at the end, they can also be able to achieve us if the economy, and together the saved bank will be returned.
The legislative proposal includes that in the next five years the President must present the Congress a proposal for which it is available to repeat the proposed losses from the financial sector.
Of course, both parties have been those who have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us to defense the dollars of the contributors - he declared the Republic Deputy of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic College of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the provisions were taken by the same who are responsible for Wall Street's crowl.

Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January may enter the United States-Ungarian Agreement of Exception from the view - the Minister of Estonia has spoken about this to Chicago with the U.S. representatives of the location.
According to his opinion, "how everything depends on the fact, but the other ocean is built in time the electronic input and control system."
However, he rejected the attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no longer the permission of income, but before the department, the tourists will have to be recorded.
The responsible for the Ungarn diplomacy will continue from today the Treaty in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of the Exterior Condoleeza Rice, in which he will admit the medal of the Cross of the Republic of Hungary with the Star and will interpret with the customers of external policy of the Democratic Barack Obama candidate and republic John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also been shooted for bank saving plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates to the President of the two large American parties, have guaranteed their support to the Government Plan of 700 billion dollars for the saving of the banks, but there are politicians who reject the departments of the Minister of Tessor.
The representatives of the Congress and administration after the long-term treaties for day, on the evening, they have announced that they have concluded a principle agreement on bank saving plan.

Increasing print of the German language world
The pool of the right is intake, only within the pole of the electorers became more comprehensive - so Der Spiegel analyzes the devil result of the CSU in Baviera.
The Haider Party is ready to rule Austria to stop the red-near coalition.
The speed (splay.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet editing of the German review, in the article The Baviera Revolution divorces his parents analysis the causes of the lost dramatics of the CSU.
According to the political note, the CSU heroion has already been started very much before the crazy Beckstein-Huber's training.
The social Christians have re-moderated the Baviera for decades and now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all the Christian democracy, also of Angela Mercer.
The defense was not a great surprise for the CSU, but the Sunday was completed a process that was exactly ten years ago realizable: the undisability of a State party was completed.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was pregnant to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% of the 50 years.
This has repeated three years ago to the elections of the Bundestag in 2005 still during the period of the same stated Stoiber.
This is why modernization is done in the region, which divorces parents.
The sociologists have pronounced it for 40 years ago, but they have been very wrong with time, but the secolarisation, the results of education, the introduction of the East and North Germans in the Bavaria developed region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of electorers in the CSU.
The modernization is a couple of steps with the increase of the possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pool of the right is intake, only within the pool of the electorers became more conscious, critical, ostinated.
It is also surprised that in the past weeks, the classic groups have gone from the CSU: professional freedoms, arts, diplomats and laughers.
Here the support for the CSU has gone under 40%.
The Press (depresse.com)
"Who with whom?" In the article "Presidents of the Parties are locked in coalition issues" the confusion of the internal Austrian political situation created after the elections.
SPÖ means to be treated with the OVP.
The OVP takes the interview of the SPÖ in its internal business.
The BZÖ shows open to treatment in all directions, the green don't want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now round all around coalition; in the debate transferred from the TV, the leaders of the parties did just see the cards.
Werner Faymann President of the SPÖ confirmed that you want to treat with the OVP.
The SPE wants to demonstrate that the cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Moltrer, current president of the OVP, as vicecanceller.
As he stated, the course Schussel-Moltrer has been in any case respiratory.
The repeat of this direction is not considered.
Molter has reacted wisely all red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann is trying to enter into the internal affairs of the OVP.
If its party chooses the opposition or enters into coalition is still a thing open in the party, the issues will be discussed in any case within the OVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ repeated that he was opened in all directions.
"To prevent the red-new coalition we are ready to assess our responsibility to rule," said Haider.
Jaroka: You must spread the visa circulation of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris, the European Summary for Party Opportunities, organized this year from France with the Presidency of tourizing the European Union.
Livia Jaroka, Mr Fidesz of the European Popular Party, in the message directed to the fulfillment of the main reporter of the Congress has requested the attention to the school section because it is the most serious legal violation that hurts the children of rom and that the most serious cost for their statement.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, in the name of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner Vladimir Schpidla responsible for the employment, social businesses and other opportunities have opened the conference at the maximum level.
between the invitations to the Conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil organizations and defence of the rights in the area of equal opportunities.
Jaroka, according to the office of the Parliamentary Group Fidesz PE, he remembered, in addition to discrimination in the meetings, that roms come out of the work market in the first place because of their low school.
"The most of the young rooms have no middle-level study title and as follows the elementary education of evil quality only a irresponsible number of them can get a highest study title."
Jaroka also underlined, as the fundamental right of humans, the key role of education in make the value of human rights.
Investment in education of rom children can mean the strengthening of the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to make considerable in the largest area between the rooms and the non-rounds of these links.
In fact, as the school starts a rom, it increases its possibilities to become a productive member of the work market; through the payment costs and consumers contribute to the budget of the country.
"The European Citizenship Right of Rome must ensure their right to a quality education and elimination of low and secret schools" - sublineed Livia Yaroka.
According to the Deputy, the European Union's objective and action is necessary to accelerate school degree processes and therefore is essential to the right respect of existing and projected antidiscriminator directives.
"The visa circulation of poverty, secretation and disoccupation must be interrupted, it must give to the room children the opportunities made by the democratic space to contribute as citizens in full title of the future of Europe" - asked the York.
In the sign of the "European Year of Party Opportunities" to ensure for all, the objective of the European Summary for Party Opportunity organized each year from Berlin's meeting of the last year is to ensure a unique forum to promote antidiscrimination objectives and equal opportunities established at State and European level.
CSU: Peace for a transitional period
Finally, October will decide the sort of the Huber-Beckstein's impressed copy.
Although the brutal electronic loss has not yet fallen into the heads, bavarese CSU has been for the time revoked the discussion of personal issues.
The President of the Party Erwin Huber and the Regional Governor Günther Beckstein remain on their own place, the question is until the loving kindness is hard.
From the same time, a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary convention of the Partie in the last weekend of October.
The two very critical policies have made it to know in any case that they should not be attacked with all forces to the seat.
They have so tried to admorre the writers of the Parliamentary Group and the basis that one day after the "bavarese tsunami" have taken the personal consequences for the loss of absolute majority.
5 years ago, under Edmund Stoiber's guidance, then at the crown of his carrier, the social Christian Union receives 60,7%, but now after the struggle of state against Stoiber is 43,4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolute monarch" in Baviera, which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservators in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy will always be required in the future by any way to coalition.
As the first signal of the ordering within the party, the Vice-President and federal Minister of the Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible inheritance of Huber, receives a place in the exploiting group that will begin treatment with the liberals of the FDP and with the Liber Electors representing right values for an eventually governing coalition in Monaco in Baviera.
For a strange amusement of the destination in the list of Liber Electors entered into the legislation of that Gabriel Paul, whose attitude against Stoiber was used as a chance to shoot from Huber-Beckstein's copy to then treat the woman without regarding the great ambitions.
The CSU managers now concentrate all their powers to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
At the same time, Stoiber will also have an active role, which is still training in the shadow, and the ex-regional and ex-president of the CSU has defined on 28 September the most beautiful day of his political carrier.
Monday Huber released some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have granted greater support by the brother's party.
Other CSU policies have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
The Mercel will not be eliminated after the elections of the Bundestag established for September 2009 if it will not be restored in common forces by the CSU which has made a determinant role in the national victory of 2005.
According to the Merkel, which does not hide the delusion for the smoke, the CSU ground losses will not be negatively reflected on the great coalition of Berlin.
What is absolutely related: it will not be easy to manage the CSU harm, but the crisis of social democratics still hard.
The SPD has achieved its lower result from 1946 in Baviera with 18,6%.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition has been entered into the White Russian Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observators, it is the sign of the welfare and stability ensuring in the country guided by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained with the browls made in the content of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observators of 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million people is privileged from more than one decade, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition collected under the United States Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the fourth-renewed presidentship sentence after the constitutional change of the elections of 2006, "received" some section in the Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has so renewed to a previously assessed balance.
After the expectations of the opposition there was that the Bielorussia, always more economically depending on Russia, who requested a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas always beauty and allowed Russian gass in possession of Beltransgaz through the country, to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high range policies could not enter into the situation of antidemocratic anti-democratic policy.
It refers to a distance that the OSCE evaluating the electoral campaign has put the accent on positive movements and not on missing, such as the divorce to present for a third of the candidates of the opposition.
However, the rapid relationship of the OSCE has criticized the campaign, while the candidates in practical opposition could not appear on the pressure, and in particular that the opposition could not be presented to the content of votes.
However, according to the opposition, it is possible to understand a improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared to a small relationship with Moscow, continueing to deny the recognition of the South Osset and Afghanistan from Georgia, even though Russia, with which the Bielorussia forms on a letter of a federal state, considering the independent two countries since a month.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Bielorussia and the EU has started - has stated to our journal Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the Presidency candidate of the opposition of the elections of 2006, it is wonderful that it remains unlikely that "the power has been afraid to make a only opposition to a Parliament without pest."
The opposition does not prevent protest actions for results, but try only to come to the electorers the message of the need of economic reforms.
Of course, we have many problems, we have to print the opposition journals in Russia, for the distribution of local authorities, but I also see that more people support the change, even among the elders - said Milinkevich, not even the officially helped, the pensions, are appropriate to the rule of Lukashenko, which considers the main result of the creation of social security.
Since the unbelieving country and the increase of economic deficit is only a question of time the disgregation of social security "which remembers the sepulcrale silence" - riding Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observators have judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Independent Community has stated to the Russian Printing Agency RIA News: "Man believe not in words but in fact," so the absence of opposition is not only the evidence of maturity of the Bielorussian electorers.
Brunetta: "After the time of the work"
It has never been successful in Palazzo Chigi's history that there were rounding doors for the entrance and the exit of the dependents.
But from today you take this new measure against the robberts, against those who are timbers, and then you'll drink a coffee to the bar at work time.
The news has been presented today by the Ministry of the Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and from the Secretary-General of the President of the Council, Mauro Massi.
"Wird doors - says Brunetta - it's a tool to work better, with more productiveness, more presences and more services" needs the Minister.
"Now a new stage of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is reformism," sublines Brunetta still.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the President of the Council.
For Mass "the choice of rotative doors is also important from symbolic views."
There were no resistance from the dependents, ensure the Secretary-General: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the cooperation of all."
However, nothing more colling at work time; no more coffee and coffee.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, amazing, "a beautiful cappuccine at the 7th morning is a holy hand."
In the course of a convention to the High School of the Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister will then notice that "In three months, the admissions for the disease of public dependents have been reduced from 50%, it means to say more than 600,000 people in the work in a year."
And adds that it is necessary to make more efficient to the Administration Public
Italian, "which salary dynamics - explains the Ministry - in the last 8-10 years were double respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rates."
Thus, thousands of public dependents have been united to comply with the rules of Brunett Decreet advanced to the recovery supported by Codacons.
"While the Ministry of the Public Function will disappear today numbers about the small assessment of work because of disease - writes the association of consumers - the people of the "operative fancles" is continued to grow.
Because there are thousands of the dependents of the correct and productive public administration in Italy, which are united to declare war to illegal standards contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will include the exception of additional economic treatment for disease depending on service; the extension of the time periods of reperability of the disease worker, including control visits, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Ministry.
Work accidents, Napolitan: "Creatic prevention"
Every day, in Italy, works 2.500 accidents, die 3 people, and 27 remains permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inal data confirm that the white dead were about 1,200.
Numbers that testify the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost the dual of the decessions in respect of the murderers.
To request the attention of institutions, social forces and measures of information on this dramatic issue, the Anmil celebrates today in all provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of incidents on the work, institutionalized in the second Sunday of October.
"The concerns of the data distributed by Anmil and the same cronical tragics of these days confirm how important it is the matter of the prevention on the work," says the President of the Republic of Georgio Napolitan, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the national mutilated and invalid partnership of the work, Peter Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "life appreciation for the constant association commitment for prevention in the workplaces, protection of the employees concerned, assistance of the family of victims and sensibilisation of the public opinion."
"It's, of course, a wrath 'basta', sincerely shared, before tragedy that, for their size, raises the crying of the media and the influence of the public thinking, but the day-day reality replaces us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamic."
Napolitan does not hide that "It's unfortunately a problem of resources: it is decided to invest in education and information.
Especially significantly, the number of initiatives promoted in school for a more direct consciousness taken by young people who act in the world of work.
It is necessary to live attention to the phenomenon, not to delay in the warning on its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislation rules.
In his song, the President of the Gianfranco Camera Fini has sublined "as the fenomen of the white dead constitutes a absolute social emergency, which violates the consciousness of each of us and implies all institutions a decision of commitment to urgently end."
"The data on the information on the work seems to report a lot of positive way, but it does not remove that the number of white dead is how impressive," noted the President of Anmil Peter Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want, because, this "tendance to the bottom" becomes in less attention, because it's exactly when the attention is awake to explore the tragedy.
"We believe that at general level it is still too little to contrary the phenomenon of infortunes and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our judgment - he sublined Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves more efforts - he added - as regards the communication and sensibilisation of the public opinion.
But, in particular, a greater sense of responsibility from workers in respect of a phenomenon representing a social emergency."
Mercandelli declared then "the progressive deterioration of the indentary protection levels for the victims of the work" and the "assistential devil to which the system is spreading in the past years."
"The objective is therefore to return to the employer the security guarantee - has added - because the sort of those who are concerned should not depend on spontaneisms or equipment once by the lawyer."
MP3 readers under accusation, they risk the audience
Listen to music to high volume for a long-term time using portable musical devices such as MP3 readers can cause permanent lessons of the hearing.
It refers to the European Commission, that in a communication distributed in Brussels, the opinion of the Scientific Committee of Emergency Health risks and recently identified (Csrseri) of the U.S., published today.
"In this scientific opinion - it is reading in the note - urge that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with traveling musical devices weekly for more than one hour at the day holding the high volume device risks a permanent loss of auditive capacity."
"I worried that a so great number of young people who use portable musical devices and mobile phones at highly accused levels can disturbe their hearing in unreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"There are scientists - continues the responsible Ue - a clear risk, and we need to react quickly.
Whatever, we need to sensibilisize the consumers and give these public domain information.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to make them fully efficient and keep the step with the new technology."
Brussels asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical devices and the increase of the number of young people who were exhausted to their dreams.
"The scientists - conclude the Ue executive - confirm that there is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now consider the Member States and the interested parties which measures may be adopted in order to be better protecting children and young people from the exhibition of the room from portable musical and failure devices."
Currently, there is already a European Security standard that limits to 100 dB to the level of dreams of portable musical equipment, but increases the concerns as well as the hearing damage that can be excessive from a excessive exhibition to such sound sources.
It is possible to be limited to very much these diseases in resolutions such as reduction of the levels and the exposition of the dream.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee presents that the users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (increasing more than 89 decibel) music for only 5 hours for week, the limits are currently in force on the maximum room allowed on workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for more prolonged periods risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would be about 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2,5 and 10 million people in U.S.
Roman, Germany gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March is closed, in June, the sums will be cut off.
This is the calendar fixed by the Campoglio for the works of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale" which has been seated this morning in his new seat behind the terms of Caracalla.
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will set the guidelines for Rome.
Once I close the batteries on March, the June and the common Council will evaluate analysis and projects, so that I can present the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official ballion" of the Campoglio and his prisoner Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented all the political, social and cultural ideas - has to subline German - has to provide proposals for a Rome development idea of which the political decisions, which remain the Joint and the common Council, will then be able to assess.
There is no role surposition but only the will of have a place to develop a large project for Rome.
In March it will end its jobs and then it will be smoothed, because this experience must have a necessary time.
In June - announce the challenge - we will present the strategic plan using the work made by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
To those who accuse the Commission of Inutility, since its opinions are not linked, Germany replies: "All depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is too often raised on the management of the day and on the emergency often.
In contrast, we want to watch more long and far away, in a deepest perspective, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and his future."
In addition, Rome's chair has to point out that "the Commission is not an inutile entity or a cars zone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost an euro to the Roman citizens and will be rational and involved with the best intelligences that express the Chapter."
For Germany, "this must have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a level-authentication, which has absolutely needed, thinking with a single spirit in its future."
A future that requires Rome's syntax "not to be limited to the only present common borders but will look well more than" not only in the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first president of the American. That's why
He wrote a American political note that has to pass for independent: "Back Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions described the United States economy and had relations (as also today from private citizens) with Islam's enemy."
They increase the attacks against Obama just while the date of elections is close.
She wrote a Miss Miami in a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face toast: believe that he will win the highest carrier of a nation who has been in two rulers and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attackers that do not say much; they are clearly ataking of racial nature, and they do not answer the question of the electers: it will be a good president? There are the pollens; they say all that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A journal of Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote a editorial: Once in the cabin to vote, we know well who will vote to his vote the American patriota.
He's out of a side of the American mentality covered until the last.
"Get what you want, then we'll think where to put the cross, if on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you should win Obama, we'll go out of America.
This has never been said before now, which seems likely the success of the black candidate.
However, although all these reasons, the weapon winning for democratic is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? The 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home to seats.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost life and the Americans have not been required to do the valleys.
Yet, Iraq for most people was the difficult point of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a great job to run.
Use, the economic trace also feels about journalists: in the journals is time for tags. And many make the wrong on the Internet, "assisting" of the printed paper.
Fifty hundred American journalists have been interpreted by the PEW Research Center on their employment and mental control on the future.
Now, journalists are almost all pessimists on their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly declare that they feel less worried about faithfulness.
They don't feel isolated like one time.
The problem for American journalists is the money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
Furthermore, the tags in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to set the journals, are a big problem.
It is a problem that is resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you don't want the traditional journalism as it means that the large public is sustainablely reduced.
A light but complex pessimism perverse today the US journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and executive elders are convinced that the day at national level is followed by a wrong route.
In local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest edit houses are opening a bark to the Internet, for many views like the "shart" of the printed card.
The "economic pressure" warning journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they have broken the technology in the hope that "Do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest space today in the American journalist is between those who lead newsrooms - that's the directors - and reporters who work for them.
The 56% of national executives are sure that their reporters deal their values, while at local level the percentage is declined to 23%.
For some this is going to do with the "security of the work."
Executives that think to lose the workplace around 3 years are at 47% at national level.
For the staff reporters, it's 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (in our editors, ndr) in America is always at the agenda.
Only 13% of the journalists work with a contract.
In a great nation like Us, with 300 million people and thousands of journals, reviews, radio, tv and internet workers often offer what they want and become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
The directors are almost always received big salary, while the editor can also win 10 thousand dollars per month, in addition to the pension and payment of assessments.
For heroes, then, the ratio is complicated: every day after the first year, all the third to come to 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, for their admissions, are often "amala" during the year.
It's all climate issues.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA TO GROTTAFERRATE
The President of the second criminal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the existence of the immobiliar Daniel Coppola, who asked that he could move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bancared in the research on the conflict related to the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the process to his carrying, last week, he received the loading from households transformed to residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the immobilier could travel the traitor from the town of provincies to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the Court of Justice these movements (which he has given contrary to the pm), they would allow him to influence his company and to access the evidence that they accuse it.
Elliots in danger
The phenomenon has already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the Chamber of Representatives against the saving plan of 700 billion dollars from the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is, more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the economy.
There is a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday by informing us that the crisis in the course is spreading the Republic Party, always more divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and the new soul, however, conservatory, orstyle to "thes of Washington" and the world of the financial, very strongly in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the appeal, which has been done prepotently lived with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this is only a example of changes, big changes, that the economic earthquake in the course may be prejudiced or already left: not only in the United States but in the entire west and maybe not here only.
You are using that the crisis in Europe seems to be functioned by the accelerators of phenomenon in incubating since the new climate is solidized and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomenons is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary relanch, of the double state-surrane category in relation to a kind of re-in-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, for it is a crisis of bank-financial institutions which have, yes, living with the outside, but that, in the first, all, they see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single State.
It makes a political problem immediately for those who govern him: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and the protections of those people and the families who, among others, are also a electorate.
However, the crisis appears economically, but politically is nearly nationally exclusive.
The political internationalist seems essentially out of the game or does not have much to say: the light test is given by the European Union that is usually divided as usually between the various interests and the different state strategys cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the Government of each State that all wait for interventions, salvation and refugee plans, new rules, and especially funding erogation: since when it comes to the streets, only States who have economic resources, the massage of financial resources to try to repeat things in the sixth.
And there are also the necessary measures and legislation to use them: two resources of unrecommendible value, in certain circumstances, which, likely, no markets and no international organization will ever be available in analog measure.
This new factor that the crisis puts on the national status element is the rest of perfect symptoms with the importance of the most recent economy developments have to contribute to a factor that is stretchly linked to that element: the territory.
Fortunately, while we were convinced that we were now entered into the kingdom of the network, the technology always more sophisticated, the immaterial, while we were convinced that the globalised finance was now destined to dominate the world, we agreed with a treatment that our future should make accounts increasingly measured with those things as little immaterial things that are water, collected, petrolio.
All things that, look a little, can be transported from a place to the other land but are absolutely linked to a circumscripted space, to a territory.
Because those who are to be supervised, there are certainly many cards in respect of those who are not, to those who have the effort to live in a place without collecting, without petrolio and without water.
I'm coming to the second news, however, that's a fracture.
Who says the Territory, the State, the Government, inevitably says political, and then Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomenon.
On one side the comprehensibility of the objective needs of authority, the request of someone who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a discredit rate for existing leaderships, economic species, is so unacceptable and full of dark zones.
And together something of more deepest and in some concerning sense: a discreet, a discreet, an inadequate image, a sense of disagreement, a sense of lowerness, which is involving the whole class guided in a growing number of West countries.
It seems that it is always more ways, in wide areas of the population, the convince that before their actions are the same ideas of the social electoral electors at the eight, their way to hear and to be, their culture in full accession of the term, to make its time and to be always more stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The request of leadership, insomma, food subterraneously packed but powerful movement of delimitation of the officers and traditional political assets, which appears in the immediate "revolution" electoral or in the repenting efforts of the colticides of these recent and recent times, from the conservative access in Austria-Bavia to the cross of labristic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American conventions against Bush (behaviour also in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that traditional electors, their parts, their programmes, but also their reviews, their journals, their intellectual accredited, their formats would say someone, make it always more fatal to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not from today to be formed in the deep streets of the West society and that the economic crisis renews, increases, achieves potentially to dismiss.
In the presence of all this, speaking about a "rebellion of the mass" at the agenda would be frankly exagerate.
But keep your eyes open, it's not for nothing.
The supercolumn to walk on the walls
Construct the laws of gravity thanks to a super cool and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
With a only 2,5 square centimeters, the studies were able to include a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American Science Report has published the findings of some researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material designed by the studio team is an evolution of existing people who use a particular carbon structure called nanotubi carbon.
“The principle of the coll can be imagined as a series of systemed tubes as a spray ball” explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired to the eggs, recovered by microscopic games that can ensure a perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the vetro, Teflon and vetrate paper, have shown that the new advice is ten times more powerful of these corrections and at the same time"s easily stays from the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton.
CAMMINARE SUI MURI? - "This material may be useful as transitional advice" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers think about a very lesser use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbone nanotubs are carbon drivers of hot and current electricity.
Other applications may be related to the airspace industry.
For the time you're no superheroe.
ALTRA RICERCA – Even the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to search for a new advice.
In an article on the American Chemical Society, California studies have presented an adsive format of microfibre as hairs that automatically clean from the pools during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect attitude.
Farms: never with your fruits
Attention to the supply of pomp, to the ranch and milk.
These drinks, especially consumed in states because different and rich vitamine, if you agree simultaneously with some saved drugs, change the assumption by extending or reducing the efficiency in second of the cases with severe consequences for health.
To resume the risks of fruit sucks are convinced that frequency associated with the association of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, which from the 236st national meeting of the American Chemical Society in the course of Philadelphia starts a new alarm: just a bit of pomple, ornament and milk to reduce the assumption of some saved pharmaceuticals, and note the benefits of the health of patients.
The supply of pomplom was already finished under accusation because it was responsible to increase to toxic levels the effects of some anti-arithms, antibiotics, anxiolic, antistaminics and neurologists.
FARMACI A RISCHIO - The same Italian Agency of the pharmace had given you news in an information bollettino for two years ago, alerting medical and patients to not assess the danger from this mix and to make attention to what you drink in the case they assume medicine such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NON SOLO POMPELMO - According to the experts also the sport of ransom and the meal contains substances that infect the medicine.
Length of the list of active principles infected from the pomp and the other sucks.
From here the calling of Michele Carruba, Director of the Pharmacology Department of the State University of Milano: "There are noted in general to the various international and national pharmacological agents that will eventually amend the medical information notes.
So always read the illustrative tables of the medicines that are summary and if there is something that is not clear, let us not impress, but ask for the doctor or pharmacist,” sublineed the expert to Ansa agent.
The Nobel of Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Premium for Economy was assigned to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokinesian who teachs Princeton University and is a editorial note of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical choices in economic and external policy of Bush's administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, in the days that Enron had fallen, Krugman was provided in a newly published editorial on New York Times that the second event would be more determined than the first, in terms of the history of the United States.
A prevention that has escaped not a few polymers and that for years it has been renewed to the economist, but now it has been clear.
“I am surprised and also a little shocked for the speed with the memories of the scannes such as Enron or Worldcom's collection were lost from the attention of the public,” Krugman stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "grande value economy" but also a developer with a "agressive" style, particularly critical against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third editing of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity sequence that looks forwarding more users, from the house to the office, from professionals to the public administration, as free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After a work of nearly a year from a voluntary developer, where SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office is shown to the large public with various news: to the welcome and the reviewed interface and review less sustainable, it is added more sustainable as the natural compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operational system and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Attention also to interoperability with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as that allows to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via email, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, saving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "PDF hibridi" documents that accompany the typical graph of Adobe format with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text designer.
The cooperation is a element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the calculation she can intervene in more hands between various users, eviting conflicts on the changes, in the text designer, each collaborator is assigned to a color in comments for a better recognition in a revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks should release the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable to the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English that was found on Friday mirror.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, as useful is also available for the Linux operating system.
On the request, the installation CD can also be delivered home or on workplace.
And if the theme of freedom may be a training for divorce in houses, it is just in business that Open Office sequence is trying the great challenge, and you can have already counted on various projects made in the public administration and schools.
And they don't even miss realities that offer a training, consultation and ideal assistance for small and medium business, which can open business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that looks to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint emulations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous access is the program that allows working on the database; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The target for 2008 is to be achieved to 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at least 3 million and 600 miles, with the outcome of the new version, it is likely that you can also overtake the preceding number.
Even Kohl positive results is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Jerolsteiner team, third classified and winning of a better scalator.
Reporting the news is the site of the Daily Team.
The 26th Cohl is the fourth positive course in the Cerah, the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Cohl's blood campaigns include the effects in the last weeks from Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the contro-analists confirm the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place in Tour and go to meet two years of canonic scaling.
To ensure the news of Cohl's positivity at the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agent, Pierre Bordry, who has made known the Associated Press that he has notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austria was placed on the final podium at the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also added the ball to a better scalator.
IMMIGRATI: NEW YORK TIMES TO CHIED, ITALIA Is READ?
The Italian "of the emigrants countries has recently been transformed in a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted with refugee.
This is how you ask in a long article in the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the discussion on the racist tema in Italy from the young Abdul William Guibre origin of Burkina Faso killed the last month in Milano by robing a box of biscots.
This case indicates what the Nit defines the "North Paradose": the north regions are at the same time where "increasing integration and more work" are recorded, but also the "heighter anti-immigrated feelings of the country and the highest support in the North League".
By confirming the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of Milano, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
In addition, the new legislation volunteer by the Legislation that ensures the immigration and facilitate the exemption of clandestini is quoted as a paradigma of climate change in Italy.
The tendence underlined by Pape and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitan in meeting Benedetto XVI in Kirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to destroy racism."
Provided students of caro-friends to 900 euros for a room
The market for colleagues doesn't know the crisis.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the syntax of inquilinis, take a single room can cost a student to 900 euros in Milano, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoli, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to exclude all young people from the right to the study for the highly complementary costs that the families of provincies should support - explains the responsible for the Sunia office studies, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong question of students has completely deformed the market to introduce a generalised process for residents."
In most cases, the asset offers contain a series of violations: free type of contracts, not registered, without canon limits, linked sub-affits.
For Sunia, there are extraordinary interventions that, through the review of the fiscal imposition, they can calm the prices.
Seeing the details of the investigation, we see that in Milano, for a place leaving in Brianza area, they achieve about 450 euros; for a single room goes from a minimum of 650 (zone Black) to a average value of 800 (zone Lamuerte, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria).
In Florence a bed place costs a average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bolonia, where students concentrate in near the University areas, 250/280 euros were achieved for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single place.
In Rome in near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bolóna), they asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed place.
Only lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
Only if you move in peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bedplace and 450 one single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Napoli for a bed place arose 300/450 euros, for a room spreads from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari for a bed place was 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater pest in citizen economy.
In the cities where it is more frequently the phenomenon of the affairs to extracommunist students, such as in Perugia, is finally registered a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested foreign students in respect of the application of the Italians.
Ancient cinema, the cities canceled the story sales
Historical cinematographical sales are closed in favor of Multiplex.
"A cities without cinematographical sales is a circle town, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the register Joseph Tornator photographs with efficiency as it happens in the larges Italian cities center but also in the cities of the provincies.
The process of marginalization of the cinema, with the born in perimeters of great multisale, and the consequence of death for confusion of monosal in the central areas of the cities, is one of the events that are inevolutable and inevitable but also have all the characteristics of a true and its own cultural crime.
To escape often are history and memory loads," and as if there was a friend, a known with which we shared a piece of route and so many emotions," observes the record of New Chinema Paradise, the film that made 20 years of valuation to Tornator Oscar Premium and the Grand Premie of the Jury of Cannes, and that reached the poesia of a provincial room and the nest for a way to live the lost fish forever.
The cycles given by Anec, the main association of the exercise, speak clearly: In the past five years, the 316-shots of traditional type, and to pay the largest scot are especially the sales in the main cities: 10 in less than Firenze, 9 in Milano, Napoli, Bologna and Rome, 6 in the least to Torino, 5 in Pallarmo.
Among the most closed regions, Emilia-Romagna with 82 persis monosal cinema, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their loss is the event of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new multisale cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 or in Toscana as Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has been developed irresponsionally” observes Paul Protti, President of Anec," it is useful to build new structures but would have to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city room is closed, not all its frequencies are ready to transfer to multiplex.
In order to not talk about the missing fund for the exercise: the pre-progress debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is threatened from the ethical and moral view that the Government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros in the year."
In interest, the first Italian town, which, concerned with closements, decided to run to the banks with the signature of a protocol between Community and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to tute and promote monosal cinemas even in the history center.
In the provisions of the provisions there are measures for fiscal approval for managers and benefits for the public in moving terms: spectaculars may enter the limited trailing area and have special targets for the bottom and some parks.
"This is a initiative that I like" observes Joseph Turnator, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bolóna, which makes other measures.
However, to contrary the multiplex strategy, traditional sales must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more required.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that was always important for me: the closement of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescentship, was the cyntilla that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradise", which I thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I passed before the Rial or the Chirinal of the National way now closed, there I lived many shared emotions, so that I don't see the cards changed from the pool.”
Legislation between the political and the 'inlanded arrest of Joia Tauro's prisoner
"The jurisdiction of Joia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Community in the interests of the Piromal cosca."
The accusations are crucial that the leaders of the Antimafia Direction of Calabria replies to the accusation and the accusation of Joia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested for external concurrence in mafiosa association.
In the hand also Joacchino Piromalli, the mediator of the clinical and public administrations, and his advocate nipote, homonim of the boss, already condemned for association for mafioso stemp, condemned to reach 10 million euros.
"In any legal and moral rule, as well as the good sense," write the officers, both local administrations had expressed the will of paying advice to the Piromal law.
"It would be so allowed to the cook - they write the judges - to enter officially in the municipality by applying the possibilities, already great, control and address of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Calabrese Regional Command Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collection between local entities and malvage are too many" in his region: "There are areas where mafiosa intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local policies that resist the pressures of the 'and the heroes who keep clean'.
Wednesday arrests follow the last July in which the police announced that they had decapited the Piromal box.
Since the end of April, the common Council of Joia Tauro was broken, but already in 1991, and always for the conditions between the organizated criminality and the local administration, the local policies were raised from the lack of administration of the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, prisoner of Udc at the time of the shoogliding, was chosen at the head of a central right coalition, after the balling of May 2006.
He cried to the scanning when the Prefecture ordered the smoking of the common advice.
He called the officer of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him that he had architected all for a political question, but the judges, in the order of signed arrest, explain that the Piromal Stock was coming to ask the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental intercepts in the contrast of Dal Torrione, write the pm, "the accessibility to marry the requirements of a company, representative of a larger group notely close to Piromalli, uniforming the elections of the public administration to the interests of the cocaine."
When the energy is born from where they now go into the fields of the big
It's a lost jail, which works over 70% of the surface of the planet, and now it is discovering the large world companies of energy.
Where, running, sea are the new sources of renewable on the eyes, and now they're trying to put their hands, covered like Chevron.
The possibility of reaching energy from the sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 70s, in accordance with the first petrolifer crisis, the research has intensified.
When the price of the petrolium cald, around 1980, the idea of use of marine energy was made by part, but now the environmental existences and the new growth of the pet is impulsed to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that the 15 percent of the world-wide electricity factory could be covered by the equipment of marine motors.
This quantity would be the double of the currently produced by nuclear centres.
And more, there would be the sea and the sea.
I've got the attack.
The first company to explore on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 has established an agreement to build a manufacturer in North Portuguese.
When the insight was announced, he seemed a revolutionary step.
In two years of distance to be commissed on marine energy are always more and between these companys voted forever to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on the ocean energy - she declared the portion of a company consocied with the USD petrolifer cooling to the Economic Wall Street Journal - and he assesss the possibility of cooperating with us."
In this regard, the cooperation concerned with the opinion of a permit from the Staten Commission for Energy, necessary to launch a project of use of marine energy in Alaska.
It's not a little signal, especially if you think that it's actually in Alaska Uses continue to extract petroleo and recently President Bush has started a plan for new trivellations.
In addition to Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey's New Jersey's New Jersey's energy route to pass from the sea and the invested sums, as well as you don't know in the details, indicate the observators an increasing interest.
The technology to put on the point.
Experts talk about a technologie still to the areas, even because the marine energy does not all the doubts on the environmental impact.
For now, the facilities such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small sizes and do not seem to create big problems on the ecosystem.
To produce the energy of its wide scale, however, if they need to use technology with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, use a bottle system connected between them.
The street of the streets, which moves the bows on and down, is converted into a hydroulic pressure of guns and cilindros inside the galledians.
The pressure turns a turbine that's once a generator.
Electricity is sent to rive through submarines.
For now there are four instruments of this type in the way of designation, waiting only for the federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military installation.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a commercial center and a parking using six submarine turbines in East River of New York.
The movement of the water when the seas are turning to the walls of the turbine, creating a rotation movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said that there is a long list of customers waiting for the required authorisations to use energy.
After the place, the sea.
A special interest, they say to the Institute for Energy Research, which is now the potential of the sea.
Although a intermitting phenomenon is more preventable than the wind, the sun or the streets, and then more trustable as the source of energy.
It's exactly on the energy of the sea that was like the New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who are achieved on costs, have already invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and proposed investments to 35 million for 2009.
