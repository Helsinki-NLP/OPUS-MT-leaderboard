There's nothing.
I couldn't leave you in the dark.
I can't say that twice.
You can't really kill Tom, right?
He didn't feel good, so he decided to visit the doctor.
I don't feel nervous.
I know a little bit about the weakness.
Mary buyed something.
Something tells me Tom's right.
I have something left.
We'll eat something.
Something's hiding before me.
I didn't expect something like that.
I'm not gonna support something like this.

You didn't care.
You didn't care.
Don't give me that!
Please don't give Tom a false hope.
Don't give it to Tom, he won't serve it.
Don't give it to that cowboy!
I've seen Tom last night.
I've met Tom and Mary in the supermarket recently.
It wasn't scared, and it's been his life.
They don't do any problem because five fathers live over us.
Don't you worry about your marks?
Wednesday they're the last day of the week.
Don't do me better than I am.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

I can't stop thinking about Tom.
I can't say if Tom's dead or only in unbelieving.
I can't do that.
He didn't finish his job in time.
I don't think it's gonna break up tonight.
The missing money took her to go with me.
The unreaching of the sun light calls for some people to depression.
I'm not supposed to imagine that Tom would do it.
We're not allowing Tom to destroy our plans.

I don't let them go out of my dog.
I don't let you go there, but Tom's going with you.
I don't let Tom take my sister.
No, I'm afraid of spirits.
It doesn't work, right?
Don't put it on me.
I wouldn't do that to Tom.
Don't look at what you're doing, the result will be the same.
The accident happened to Tom's inobservation.
The accident has made a travel.
Don't play with her city.
I don't play so good as I played.
I got some inspiration.

A man.
Some Sioux gave that old traper gold nugget.
She first met him in Boston.
Let's go first talk about what Tom did.
I'm not going to work.
I'm not going to school.
The most important is health.
Don't eat when I'm standing next to you.
He didn't eat two days.
Not only Tom needs to study, but also me.
Not only Tom's born almost blind at one eye, but not on the other in his progressive age, he doesn't see anyone well.

I sweared her with the hairs.
"I'll be great for you," she agreed.
Please slow the flowers.
The salary was paid.
He's on her.
Let's get it under the wheel.
She loved the Russian advisor.
Did you love her for the first view?
Love is one thing to take somebody is the other thing.
I killed the guns on the ground.
She's closed in his room.
Did I shut up the main entrance?
I thought I had this job for this time ready.
Let's lie.
I don't care about you.
You paid more than she had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid the money card.
You paid more than you had.
I'll get Tom's mail.
Does Tom pay for that?
Please enter the radio.
Please enter the radio.
Please enter the TV.
It would be dangerous to get into that Tom.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Did you forget everything we did for you?

First, I'm without crown, I'm not gonna have time.
Did I write everything right?
The reactions are neutralised by the kissiles.
I'm the last one who knows the truth again.
I've lost the shoes again.
You're lying again.
You've returned back to your old ways, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I've heard to talk to someone.
I'm serving good things.
I'm supposed to know the truth.
They'll serve what they get.
You're serving good things.
We've been sleeping.
I've stopped my heart.
Anybody stops business with people?
He was shooting because of the unfortunate love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.

They took her into the ball and deceived.
While I read, he called the phone.
While Tom was still sleeping, Mary was already upstairs.
You can still be with me.
You're not gonna break anything yet.
Did the police stop him?
Did you stop Tom?
Shut up.
He won't pay me for this.
I won't pay for this.
That's why Tom's gonna hurt you.
I can't do that for Tom's operation.
You don't have responsibility for Tom's death.
For Tom's failure, the whole group was overcome.
I love you for that.
I'm not nice for this.
Three months after Tom was dead.
They sold me five dollars for this taste.
She hit him.
I'll call back until I get up to the bus restaurant.
I'll call you later.

Call me tomorrow.
Call my father, and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call the rescue!
They closed Tom in the ship, so he couldn't escape.
I closed the door to not hear us.
I closed all six windows.
Close the book.
Shut up on the door.
Close the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We can sing another song.
I called the call and waited.
We've lost some old things.
Get out evidence.
She rewarded him.
I'll make the ocean.
I'll make you nice.
The weapons industry brings tissues, but also suffering.
We have the rest of the day for us.
It's only one day.
What's the meat going on from?

It seems Tom's right.
Looks like Tom doesn't remember anyone of us.
It seems Tom's sleeping.
It looks like Tom lost the meaning of life.
It seems he knows everything.
It seems he's cutting his obligations.
It seems to lose the motivation.
Here's my school's picture.
It's needed to use a partner here.
We went out of the house early tomorrow.
I'm going to try this topic with her.
I'm going to ask Tom for help.

Ask your mothers.
He had a sound, so they all heard well.
He got a little radio.
He spoke, fell down, and divorced, but he also rewarded and became honourable.
He tried to not think about her anymore.
I didn't like him from the beginning.
Shut up, please.
Get out of here!
Hubla.
We're alive.
We live in this city since 1960.
Would you like to live here?

Life is a great suffering.
Life isn't easy.

Try this!
Try to explain to Tom.
Try it again.

I know his name.
I know just a few words.
I know her by name.
I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the right reason why you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.
I know your younger brother very well.
The destruction is a delicious crime.
You know me enough to know that I wouldn't do it.

Captain's disappointment left the ship.

I've told them that they'll lose the radio again.
I'll read it again.
From the cloud snow with rain.
Working is another thing in which I'm not very good.
They got it.
They sing in the congregation.
She's singing, she's singing for me.
She didn't touch me from the beginning.
The dog came from the write table.
Two kids came out of the room.
The message about Tom's death was amazing me.
I made him a lot of problems.
She betrayed me, I'm crazy.
The crazy jabl fell out of the tree.
I'm hungry.
The scarlet is rose.
It's crazy.
The scarlet was broken.
They've made a new company in London.
I'm seeing you and Tom.
I just thought about something.
I just got to write a letter when he came home.
They've got my life.
I'd cut off all the eggs if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Abortion the advice.
You can't meet me here.
She broke her face.
We can get a lot of precious information from that book.
You've been hungry.

I've participated with that debate.
I've been involved with that pitch.
I'd stay and tell you, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We've stayed up.
Stay home.
You're gonna stay or you're going?
You're gonna stay or you're going?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and shut the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay in the mobile.
I'm staying with you.
The consciousness has gathered me.
Take your hands before you answer.
Get out of the hair and help!
We'll take you.
We'll get it better.
You can do it alone?
You can do it alone?
You can do it yourself?
I chose the way of the smallest resistance.
Call me the phone!
The weapons were calling out.
The weapons started smoking.
They shot it.
I've got a kitchen.
We're going to get everything.
I'm gonna get it.
