Reconsidering the very American idea of the Working Rights as human rights
The Congress Congress Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a law proposal to establish the organization of business as citizens.
"So as businesses die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democratic Democratic from Minnesota and the representative of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
That is why I am honored together with John Lewis' citizenship.
This basic law provides workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate because of the organization of businesses such as in other forms of discrimination and stops so anti-economicly established powers.
The fulfillment of the National Work Service to create a possibility for a discrimination workers to organizate a trade representation to make a civil court for justice, and to obtain disorders or criminals, is a simple and necessary initiative.
But it's not a radial initiative - anyway not according to American standards.
In fact, it is the best way and way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their law scheme, the connection to a very American idea.
Instead of the receipts which the companies were made in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries in the whole country - the Americans encouraged one country to recognize and maintain work rights in all the world.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country was called Democracy, Democracy, Speech Freedom, Press Freedom and the Union law.
When the United States posted the Second World War of Japan, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his stab encouraged the country to decide to ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their companies took a role in designing a new Japan, they used a language that explained that "the rights of the workers are guaranteed to joint and trade and trade."
When the United States set up after the Second World War of Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his stave tried to write the Germans to the fact that the fashismus Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In the recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves, and should exalte their voice in the new nation, Germans added a clause that explained: "The right to make uniforms to ensure work and economic conditions and improve each individual and guarantees each employment or weapons.
Agreements, which restrict this right or deem to deny it, are zero and none; it is increasingly increasingly.
When the first Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had included the Chairman on the International Human Rights Commission, from which the general declaration of human rights was described as the 1948 of the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other officers had a guarantee that "alone has the right to make the works for the protection of his interests or to assist them."
Since generations, Americans accept fundamental priorities that the work rights are human rights.
As this country has learned how to form civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to the establishment of a society - and that then this society should be protected in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government institutions.
Since these rights have been made in America under committee, it is really very wise to bring the American idea again, so the worker people must have the right to join themselves and to create themselves in a free and open society.
As pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said for fifty years:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement has not limited the strength of the nation, but she has increased.
Through the upgrading of millions of people's life standards, a great work has created a market for the industry, and the whole nation has contributed to unpresentable production levels.
Those who take the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should also do that.
Formal recognition of the Working Rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the design of employment resistance - is less vulnerable.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that Americans have grown in the past and solved the promise of democracy.
The Judge stops a timely law that all the department clinicals in Louisiana could be closed.
A US Budget Officer stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, by the officer said that it would probably be carried out to close all five department clinicals of the State.
This measure, which was highlighted by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, and should be held in force on 1 September, would be doctors to carry out the distractions to a patient's right to take a hospital in a radius of 30 miles in order to reach their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to act legally while they request such a law.
"The customers can continue to work in law while they are trying to achieve these rights," wrote John deGravelles in his judgment.
In a month, a hearing for the judge shall be established to make a longer decision for the law.
Department officers welcomed the decision in a number of judges against similar measures and said that doctors had so much more time to obtain the rights of hospitalization.
"The present decision means that the women in Louisiana are a relevant law to take them their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and President of the Centre for the Reproduction Rights, which had taken in the name of three of the five clinicals of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear if the court also was inclined to the doctors of the two clinicals who did not apply the claim and requested the rights of indication.
Louisiana is one of 11 states who have adopted similar laws, which recently have stated these measures in Alabama and Mississippi for unconsciously.
The keys of a law in Texas, which most of the clinical clinicals remained in the state, were stopped by a federal judge on freedom.
The American Medical Association and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association says that doctors require unrequired limits.
The separators believe that the measures serve for the protection of womenâ€™s health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closement of clinicals.
Only a doctor carried out in Louisiana distractions, had been part of the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the State are required to do no distractions anymore, this doctor would not be afraid to carry out the operation for its safety, the group said.
In their argumentation against the judge, the representative of the state Louisiana said that they would not be insulted with doctors because of the implementation of distractions, while their requests were still attached to patent indications.
Proceeded diagnoses and missing access to the best treatment possibilities to higher death rates by eggs in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set a videohommage online for their mother, who died in the eggs of 2007.
For women in the rural areas Australia, there is a higher risk to die in oil-stocks than for women in cities.
The researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, which had been determined in 2005, and stated that only 25 per cent of five years after the diagnosis was still in life.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in the fields of the country, the risk of death during the study was higher than for those in the town areas.
CLEINE STUDIE: New medicinal products may suffer eggs and eggs
The researchers investigate the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of the eggs, existing preventive diseases, and social and economic states also affect the survival opportunities.
For older women and those who had already progressed to the diagnosis time, the overliving ratio was low.
For those who lived in rural and separate regions of the State, the death risk was 20 percent higher than for those in the city areas.
Although the study does not investigate why women living outside the city are dead with higher probability of eggs, Dr. Jordan encourages a diagnosis promised and missing access to the best treatment centres than possible factors.
"This disease is treated at the best of genecological occlogs, and these are most in larger cities," she said.
Instead of improvement of the telemedistic services to deal with the distances, they proposed to strengthen the service of individual medicines to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study has received a bad long-term overliving rating with women in the oil-shirt and subtracts the need for better treatment and preservation strategy.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold cup that she had a aggressive form of eggs.
Garden centres employed household payments

The report notes that the 55 per cent of the payment is deployed by the people with their own home for their gardens.
The growth of people who live in high urbanised areas without gardens, the favorite procedure to assume foreign passengers to park weights, and the branch sizes are more factors that are cutting the branch in the estimated 5 billion billion Â£ per year in the sale.
In the largest room of London, in which a period of 6 years of the share of households of 61 to 43 per cent will be reported, the less expenditure for garden products per budget shall be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticulture society indicate that homes in the middle or small gardens do not mean that people can't plant plants.
Guy Barter, chefgarten manager for the RHS said, "Container gardens, for example, are very favorable to the mine, because they can take their plans in a concurrence."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "or age" of the garden individual trade by increased households and economic welfare from the latter 1980 to the middle of the 1990s.
He also announced a better market situation for this year because of the better meteorological conditions in March and April last year.

On the evening to 21:00, more 5mm rains fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down to the Sunday night.
The last submission was the result of a number of short, stressful shoes, including a guest, which began shortly 20 hours ago, and for about 4 mm delay in about 10 minutes.
After the winter was wounded last week for an early dose, the temperatures fell in the city on Monday to a maximum value of 15,8Â°C.
The weather conditions may be carried out to the proper landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.

Matthew means: Maximum time for great disorder
In view of the galoping technical progress that causes our home to change in high-tech-scale centres, our Colomnist Bernd Matthies is comforted with an overtrusted electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my look is over the spiral table that connects the hearer to the phone, and I think, Boah, how back is that?
But afterward, there was an explanation: If the cave wasn't, all the hearers would have gone out of the house, and it would be more significant to the back.
Unnecessary applies to the electronic (electronic)?
No, tip error: electronic) sector is the rule that the world's newness of the electrochrit from tomorrow is buyed.
And, for example, whoever has another room in the room today, just says that he's essentially denied the television.
Why are these suggestions?
Because we're driving the Ifa in functioning in this week again our absolute incompetence in the issues of the electronic issues.
The lay, which was blind manager and CD player, has not understood today the purpose of the devices that are expanded with an unfavourable expert speaking before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologys" offers us the price.
Yeah, are you all right?
What should you talk to people who are openly freely expanding such quarter?
In the case, it is about 20 years ago, especially because we're happy to break our house.
So Joghurt himself encourages us to communicate the branch meals on the maledives that it burns in the room of work.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we're from the office of the climate on our busy coming...?
Yes, however, it makes a climate schedule.
But a dream will be absolutely true in the first time: We have our army, say, "South!" and the ships go home.
Go.
Everything goes out of nothing less than a revolution: "The borders of the white and brown products are moved," a branch kenner, you can connect the wax machine with a head-header, the dampger sends the weather report and the data branch to how long the pizza in the backbone still needs, but nothing is useful because we stand in the board.
From the day practice, we also know: If a newmodemic device is really needed very urgently, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral table on the phone will also survive the following functions.

By choices: CDU-Vize Strobl infrastructures NPD connection procedures
In view of the NPD's voting losses in Sachsen, Thomas Strobl was expressed for the end of the executive NPD contract procedure before the Court of Justice.
Berlin - Sound CDU-bandsvize Thomas Strobl should find the running contract procedures against the NPD before the Court of Justice.
"The NPD snippet worse than the last time," said Strobl, which is also the CDU-Land team in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Popular Time".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that allows me to get out of the result that the NPD will fight politically and not before the Court of Justice.

In the neulland place, flying floors are now undertaken in selts.
The central approach for flights in Harbour is from all nearby.
Now the internal authority has made three cells of the Red Cross.
The officers have been informed shortly before - they have been a little increasing.
"Their Hauruck actions continue to preserve the citizens and give the civil policies no opportunity to affect the human department of flights," says Britta Herrmann, the Fraction President of the Green in the Harbour's Conference.
Your party requests Harburg's officer's officers to be available to subtract homes that are currently unused.

The house prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, shows a longer monitoring index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Hedonic Home Value Index for own homes in the Australian main city increased 1,1 per cent in August, so the RP data from the Monday.
The total increase in June, July and August is at 4,2 per cent, the largest increase in the wintermonates since 2007.
The annual price increased at 10,9 per cent, more than double as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed over the country.
The Research Leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne had a two-parted market.
The numbers of RP Data indicate that the house prices in Sydney increased 16,1 per cent in Melbourne are 11,7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, in which the prices are averagely increased in five and six per cent.
On the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been achieved by the citizens in state expenditures, and where the prices only increased in the year only at 1,4 per cent.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of birthday, the next months, a increase would be observed by the immobiliariats to sell, which would submit the market "the real test".
"If you consider the high counsel of the accommodation price, a general fast vessel rate and the low-term environment, it is probably that the price of the home prices will be increased in the next three months," he said.
In a opinion to the new price, he intends the opinions of the officer Peer Medau and tests this "come a field manager".
The style of high school is not this, it means in the communication.
So if the family of Medau already has already been "Mit June has been informed on the respect of the high school.
The opinion that the plans were known only in July are definitively wrong," so PÃ¶tzl.
In the same time, he states that the plans do not belong to "proceedings or decisions", however "preferences".
Even the needful exploitation of the dark road to close is less dramatic than the Medus.
From a nine meters was a wide street, and it is not the talk.
It's after the current position to 5,50 meters, it's a metro wideer than before," explains PÃ¶tzl.
The argument of the Medau manufacturers that their free and slight park boards will be used in the future only by students of the high school, would not want to apply PÃ¶tzl.
The park is not in particular because it is allowed to solve it in the middle of intelligence as in other public parks.
Think of the inhabitants
The children's cryptic crystal, which are on the ground, and the front of their household, should not be "not affected by the high school president."
Moreover, he thinks, "it's not just about the child crisis, but also about the residents in the invitation to peacekeeping straits and the 800 students of the real school.
It's therefore more than the party interests of Mr Medau," so PÃ¶tzl.
If the criteria of the parents of the children's crisis, with the structure of the street would be allowed to lose a "the few natural flocks of Coburg", "the reader himself can decide."
In the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl wants to inform the city areas about the build development of high school to 2020 "and in this context the importance of the new solution."
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's critics about the plans of school.
However, the invasion of the new park should not lead on the campus and the Peace Rich streib, but on the Medau Barg.
That should be built the small streets at about a kilometer length.
According to the high-reviews of the Medus, the transport in the park of Closs Highfels would make it easy.
From almost 2000 vehicles every day is the talk.
From the sides of the city, you didn't want to go out to the proposal.

The main organizator Jos ter Huerne and the citizen director Heinz LÃ¶lfing showed very happy about the sons of this Councilport Events.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful life for all participants.
The organization has passed without problems and there is no negative cases," Heinz LÃ¶lfing is a positive phase of this event.
Sorry, not many participants came as the artist had hoped, which was probably on the bad weather forecast and was on the morning rain.
"We see us again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend," the adviser promises to return to the Munsterland, and the events plan a new upgrade.
Constantin Weckers Honorical Memory
It is actually more philosophy witness than biography, which Constantin Wecker, Lied Makers, Pacific, Political Activityist, Ex-Haftling, in "Manch and War" to 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thoughts for thinking fats, the born munchner subscribed his memories, each chapter introduced by a corresponding song text.
And he is honestly honest: from Onania as Gymnasiast to the laden disease and drug consumption, he does not make human disease.
Also to show how he learned tolerance in the course of his companions.
Large rooms also take abstract, but very important terms: Love, soul, Ego, his in now, spiritality - all he trys to go on the basis, very philosophy, but also very personally.
And he also explains his passifist, his society crisis, his political commitment - and even as he has not only achieved the music (the operador was made for soil and rock music), but also his prisoners.
Lastly, Constantin Wecker has also brought to the asketic moon, which includes "for subtraction" as he says, "will leave everything needed."
However, there are also short acedotes to the earth: some about sliders in one of the GIs frequencies of frequencies, or a warm-witch car travel, where he was frontally visited a tree.
He's also honest.
Lenny Henry, my father never took me into the arm.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children of a family in Dudley in the Midland in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a fabric and was limited to its relationship.
Henry tries for a comÃ©dia, Rudy's Rare Records, who shared on a imaginary conversation with his father and from the series on radio 4.
The sound track is a mixing from Reggae and Rap, with living melody.
But Henry had to work through some hard childhood moments.
He visited therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is aware of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to meet him.
He never saw his face, but he heard his voice, saying, "Stop with the crawl.
Let your sister be quiet.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown when I was a child - went with him in the neighbors and talked about things like the form of the beerglass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such conversation with him.
One big part of my life was this serious guy in the egg that reads the magazine.
Henry shortly opened a gift in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father, he won a view to how his life was for him.
Now it's something brilliant, but they're dark, surprised, deep stygical labyrinthe with flammings and smoking and a lot of rush.
My father just stood in the woods, and then could hear him quietly as he began to sing, because he could watch the gifts from himself.
When I went out there, I was clear that he had done the year to bring the food on the table, and my respect was greater than him.
However, Henry grows as a child without love promises of his parents.
My father never killed me, he never said "I love you."
First when my mother went against the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he lost as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Stop to smile me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still joined with French who was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was Diabetikerin.
That took her death.
So when I was very surprised and showed diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You must be radically.
So I went through this fitnessing, and I also had to do a drastical diet to turn the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's straight.
Nobody likes Carots.
Henry's carrier change may be shown in his elegant, short-sized bar.
Since he was promised by the critics for his Othello, he was taken from the theater.
It followed the committee of mistakes, and then Fences from August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and Comeds who have completed his business life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the bunch when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television carriers started in the middle of the seventy years. "I was for a very long time of the only black imitator/commediate in the TV."
He learned in the office.
I didn't just have to be grown up before the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an effective Witze Exchange machine, while I was a star through the TV, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 in New Faces
Since his manager set the front right on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a lot of conversation program in which the people "wheel black", Henry brought his comdy there over five years.
My family was very unbelievable.
I wanted something that would never happen, but I didn't admit that I did it.
It was an unexpectable, unexpectable position for me, but I worked in ries projects with and learned how you were involved with a great public.
But this "yearly precisely precisely low cells of the British TV" was also a "great parodie black people."
With the introduction of figures that the British Black Culture as well as feededed, Henry worked in the eighth century in an alternative comdycres.
The first row of Lenny Henry Show went in 1984 to send, and in the ninth-year-years he was under the other than the kitchenchef Gareth Blacklock in the commissary Chef!.
The publication, documentary films, TV series and films predicted his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought, "What are you doing as the next, Len, because it's all feeling so much, as you're bringing the time on or getting a little bit on the place."
Then there came a documentary series for radio 4 with the title What's so great about ...?
The first result turned to Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was just a allergic.
I've never learned something right about him in school and kept him overwhelmedly for a domain of the middle class, white in the woodshops and a cold head before it.
So I had great fear of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should test it.
Don't worry if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry led 20 lines from Othello's last conversation for the documentary film and he was inspired.
I felt that I could do that.
It was almost like someone had put my head right on me.
"So it's, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a little bit.
The tests were brutal, and I read this piece a month before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to wait for a car accident, and it wasn't just happening.
And immediately he was in the comitÃ© of mistakes.
Unfortunately, I was in the National Teater and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed you."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to talk to the public.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to overburn 10 minutes while they're repairing the computer."
Instead, the officer reported that the proposal continued when the problem was resolved.
I went from the bunch and said something in me, "Oh, God, thank you."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave someone else.
"You're playing in a theatre, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
The text to learn for Fences was fulfilled.
Panik is very good that strengthens the seeds.
It also happened well, so it's like a great shield of gods who say to me, "This is your decree."
He says this, of course, with a ONNERND.
So I stay here.
I really love that.
I like to be in a test room.
But Henry still has been the head of a comidian - our conversation has been traveled by humorous expressions while he's still imiting people again.
I have decided to do no stand-up-comedy, because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a salary full of strangers is dangerous.
If you're looking for this, you're going to go before a wall.
Sometimes I live in Apollo, if I have a pleasure, but I'm not so much as before.
I'll ask him if he's gonna make you again a stand-up-up-comedytor.
The pleasure I have in a room with a register that helps to form a beginning, a middle and the end of a travel - I don't think I want to replace it again.
Is that his new incarnation here?
I think so.
I like a shooter.
It's happy.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love story.
People love story.
Huthi Rebels Blob Roads in Jemens Main City
In the conflict between the Shiti Rebels and the Jemenite Government, the Huthis called a lot of disobedience in the main city of Sanaa.
Huthi-Attaggers would have placed central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi Party "Ansar God".
The income to the Parliament is also blocked.
Jemenic media reports from a transport chaos in the main city.
According to the online output of the journal "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called to the actions on Sunday output.
Huthi followed the details of the board with a further scale of the conflict, it should not be fulfilled by its requirements.
The Shitian Huthis fights for more independentness of the sunnitic Jemen and requires the return of the Government.
The people triumph of Huthi covers the Jemenic capital town since two weeks ago.
About 30,000 rebels have made protest ladders on the great risk of Sanaa.
In the U.S., it's always going to be a bloody fight with the Jemenic Army.
Kenia registered offices to include "registered"
Kenya started to register all state offices biometrically to remove "registered" from the maintenance lists of the government.
In the next two weeks, cooperators who wouldn't have paid any more government report.
The Government convinces that thousands of people also receive their decree from the public service and payments.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight Corruption in public service at his office 2013.
In a test at the beginning of this year, it was determined that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 Â£) per month in payments for "invested" and through other misfree financial practices lost.
The Government convinces that the customers will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the main city of Nairobi.
In the next two weeks, all employees have to appear in identification centres to ensure that their data were taken on the biometric registers were notified in a government report.
All those who do not have done this without a faithful excuse would have stretched out of the maintenance list the communication continued.
"In this process, it is essential to ratify the public service by determineing the real number of employees and also the content list on both government levels - so the "insuranced" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the office secretary in the Ministry for Decentralisation and Planning.
The skandal around the artberate Helge Achenbach is first negotiated on 11 November.
Five inheritors of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi Grenders Theo Albrecht, require in a civil process in DÃ¼sseldorfer Landricht 19,4 million Euro smoking of Achenbach and two of his companies in the insolvency procedure.
This shared a court speaker on Monday.
In the writer, Achenbach has built in the purchase of artworks and old-times, and Berthold Albrecht has calculated more than actually paid prices.
This is also higher than the agreed provision.
Achenbach has buyed for 121 million euro value costs for the Albrecht.
Children need roots and flights
44 years he was in school service, from 23 as school leader.
Since this time, Manfred judges know many Peters Houses and Kollbachers from their time as schools.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but constantly taken by his training to see people in the school.
The sneakop is the most known mountain of the ries ships.
Manfred judge loves the field with the motive from his home.
The judge was born in Trautenau/NordbÃ¶hmen, today Trutnov.
He almost interested in the four years of high school for the teacher's employment.
One year later, the Suded-end-outs were deleted.
In a half hour, the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a ship, it went to Bayern - in a good car.
So the judge was struck in the surface of the Senkendorf.
The teaching was found in Bamberg instead.
Manfred judges had to run six times per week to 10 kilometers to the next town, with the shore to Bamberg, there three kilometres or throughout the whole city to school and return to the evening.
Two months later, Manfred judge in a Red Cross house in Bamberg was a dream case: together to 15 students in a bedroom.
1951 he made the first and 1954 after three years the second state assemblies.
Since the surfants had no free teacher for him, he turned to the overseers and came on 1 November 1954 to the school in Kollbach.
The "Freulein room" was his first "service" in school.
In 1958 he attended a three-room service in the new-building teacherhouse near the school.
This house buyed Manfred judge 1980 after the school in Kollbach was released in 1968.
Before there, there were three classs in Collbach in the schoolverband Petershausen Colbach and in Petershouse five.
From school 1968/69, these were collected in Peters Houses today in Rathaus.
When the Schulverband was based on Indersdorf, only the basic school remained in the place.
In order to return in the small school, the coming director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred judge was his follower.
But Petershouse grows, and so the children and their teachers were able to achieve the current building, which was extended to the judges' pensionation 1997.
Manfred judges praise the uncomplicated greatness of Ludwig Godtz's citizenship leader, who added additionally a workspace and was built at the extension of 1997 Keller rooms, although it was not able to achieve the directives for school buildings.
"A citizen master Godtz was very kind," remembered the judge thanks.
In his whole carrier, Manfred judge never forgeted the speaker of a governor who replied to a reference of a school ratio on law and justice: "Man must never forget the love." Manfred judges set on what he heard as a young teacher.
"Man has to give the children two-party: roots and flights," says today 84 years old.
And he had to know, "This is not always going to be." If he only thinks about his scholars or even his six children, he is not clear.
In each case, the judges were sometimes unconventional.
When the teachers were predicted, they did not get a criminal work from him, and they did not even bear the neighbors.
At the cost of the congregation, the judges had two couples of box handschakes, and allowed the two contractors to address each other, even if it should be given a box.
In the room of the school, the judges made a good relationship with the citizen Leader Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
This moved the partiel judges after its pension, to candid at least 1996 on the CSU list for the Communities Council.
However, the judge was chosen in six places and the CSU was in.
180 km per 3 days
HR4-RadTOUR 700 travel vehicles set in Bad Salzhouse and Shots
If Radler's on their tour in Bad Salzhouse or shoot rast, it's nothing special.
However, on Friday only the number of rates expressed: The 700 participants of the hr4-radtor and the Begleittris took a break in Bad Salzhouse park and later a party under the free heavens in the Alteburg Park.
Under the Motto "Radels and feasts on new discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Sunday, and there was a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the Radlers took the first step, which 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhouse and continued to attack.
In Bad Salzhouse, the sporters of the citizen master Hans-Peter Seum, who was started in Bad Vilbel with the travelway, and the leader of the own office Bad Salzhouse, Petra Schwing-Doring.
For the update of the body and the spirit was all prepared for good things: the landfraues from Rantown and the Down Mocktown had 85 lyrics of apfel, switch-, stress- and cockpits, which were wonderfully cutting the strong advice.
"Solche cooks can only be back to landfraues," a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
In the pressure of the Turnsee-Blee-Nidda, cold updates could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" subscribes the visitors with known melodies of operate and musicals and argued applaus.
The beautiful environment of the Park has been amazing.
A gentleman also said, "What he has rewarded, he has reassured that he has already been cut off today."
Because the citizens and the officers had to still work: they were interviewed in the branch room of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to move in the radio for Bad Salzhouse.
In addition, the Promotion Chef Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-radtor 2004 as a tourleader, he could just go shortly, but he had a lot to do with the technology forward.
His Pickup bridge, in which he made three phones and a driver with his workers and the 15-head engine staff of the police Hessen, had also needed a check.
"The largest part of the participants is from the Riin-Main area," he said, "but also from giants or Fulda, from the lauterbach, or from Taunus, and even from many cities in Westfales are awarded.
The number of participants shall be a little after the surface capacity available.
In Category I, the participants in hotels are undertaken in Category II.
From the course, the Radlers had a good impression when they got a half-hour back, "Bye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhouse!" They wined to decline.
After the arrival in Scotland, the group was able to set a short break.
But on the evening, the Radlers were requested in the Indian Alteburg Park.
Under the region of the Scope society for tourism and town marketing (GTS), the Park had a beautiful festival environment and, of course, had the leckers, some flamm-cookies with a good feed white, prepared.
Master Susanne Schaab, GTS Officer Markus HoÃŸfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner Shachs in his function as a representative member of the ADAC Hessen-ThÃ¼ringen.
Three showed to be amazing about the "excellent operation in shoots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then gave the ball free.
The opportunity to lowly move under free sky was used, although the sport exploitation on the travel rail was freely used.
Under the guests, citizens who were also attached to the good vote were also as the great chair of the railways.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, the ships and Bad Orb - included a concert with the trainers - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 miles of radelns, the sports reached to Bad Vilbel.
Twelve Turkish polices have been established because of "rebellion" against the Government
In Turkey, in total 33 policies, local media agencies were notified because of the conscience of the "defense against the Government".
The police authorities did not directly comment.
Under the prisoners are 14 high police, reports the Honor Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers in the last December.
In July, a number of Turkish polices was arrested because they were offered to a organizated criminal agreement and were assigned to phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (the Minister of Prime Minister) described its actions as part of the activities that are introduced by the Islamistâ€™s spiritual Fethulla Gells against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost all in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the sommerfery.
This day is traditionally a important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought the Prime Minister Arseny Jazenjuk his daughter to school.
There he shared the waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but he decided to defend the country for future generations:
The seventh feasts were not stopped in every school.
The heavens are not all over Ukraine.
We need to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a large community of Ukraine's people's face must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, the school leader of Slawjansk, the daughter of Jazenjuk, said to Russian.
We hope that there will be peace again and that children have a education that will be useful for them in another life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally feededing, where the children driving feeds, holding ballons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great Director that she needs.
She travels with a honourable slipper from the banking world, the media management and the inner cross of the Tory Party.
And she's got her own front experience.
Your carriers started in the world management company Bain and Co., which changed them to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Mediterranean of Pearsons.
She was seven years old president of the Financial Times and returned when the highest posts of the mother's company Pearson went to a young man's colleagues.
Their extinction was at least 1 million Â£.
Your political ranking also is solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former President of BP, when she looked for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she was to be the branch of the cabinet.
Your husband is a previous Tory Council member.
Although in May, I described the task of the President with a promised seal.
Not only the BBC is a rich and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
The trust is in two directions: after the first garden of the own management architecture in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concerns and distress when things are wrong.
This is concerned about a nearly unfortunate duopol, which requires a complete reform.
But whose new president would risk it to be attached to all, and to take a Institution that is so complex as a Chinese dynamic, while he may bring himself to his job.
It's a hard job.
And as it wasn't enough, there are also many interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status.
While competition is closer, and new technologys have been able to ensure that the future negotiation of the license payments for the BBC is connected with special dangers.
For the valuable sum of 145,50 Â£ per year, the British public is buyed in the safeest major media company of the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that she gets 96 per cent of all households and costs only 40 penes per day.
And apparently, the BBC is raised up on the board of liberality: 53% supports them today, compared to 31% of 10 years ago.
The view and use of the BBC has changed: I get the new newspapers on my phone and see programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loving and considerable institution.
She needs a respective president - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says that the descending twith was not authorised
A second of the official user account of the Republic Governors of Texas, Rick Perry, on the Sunday, contained a detailed comment on the Democratic Officer of the State, which is in the middle of a criminal attack against him because of the crime of the officer.
The second was deleted later and replaced by another of Perry's user account, which was replaced by the previous absence.
On the other hand, a second of my account was sent, which was not authorised by me.
"I don't steal the two and have deleted him," said it in the later message.
Perry's cooperators respond not to requests on comments.
Although the seconds of Perry's official user account were out, it was not clear who actually puts the feed.
In the past tweet, a non-profit image of the officer of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, which was sent down in April 2013 because of the tremendousness.
Perry set a Veto against a financial contribution to her office when she refused to reject what could be an attack against Perry - that may be 2016 Presidentkandidat - before a Grand Jury led this month to Austin.
The text of the second says, "I don't always drink with the triple allowed alcohol speed ... but if I do it, I'll make the Governor Perry, if he spread it."
I'm the most drunk democratic in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not convinced with the guidance on the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special State lawyer from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry planned in no vindication and called the adoption a political trick.
His high-class-class team asked the judges concerned to deny the admission and argumented that the law with the elder governor in the history of the Texas State is increasingly diffused.
Perry stopped $7,5 million to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - which is attracted in Travis County and in cases of State corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return.
This Veto was concerned with a public excuse since a left Watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes rejoiced.
After he concluded the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidate 2012 as five, Perry came to speculations that he would stop by a twoth of a photo from himself at the young one near a sea position, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley explains the apartment market again for "normal"
One of the prominant constructors of London said that the apartment market in South England is returned to normal level.
The own homes in the main town were heavy and obsession of great price steadfasts that the Bank of England had been moved to be able to set up in June the above limits for the heavy credits.
Tony Pidgley, Green and Vice-President of the High-Clase Building Company Berkeley said on Monday: "After the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction level since 2013" and added to a "stable action environment".
The immobiliar market in London was well established during the exploitation, since outland buyers were driving into the main city.
According to the information of the Cataster Agency, the prices in the town area only in the past year are amounted to 18,5 per cent, more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average prices in Berkeley's private, price values and student offers increased at least a fifth in the past year and laid the end of April for 423,000 Â£.
However, in the last months of immobiliarity in London, some of them also have been attached by the introduction of new immobiliar and political retoric for a possible "vile control" before the general elections in the next May.
In the past week, the London Immobilienmaker Foxtons warned that the Hypotechnical market report for April, in the severe credit payment regimes, would also lead to a smaller market growth in the second year as well as to the prices.
The new data of the Bank of England from the Monday shows a return at the Hypotechnology obligation in July, which also means that the immobiliar market is deprived.
Hamptions International, another immobiliar agency, corrected its proposal for the increase of the immobiliar prices in London for 2015 after bottom of 3 per cent, on the basis of a huge home prices now.
The transaction volumes in the worst regions of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have been returned for an average year for a fourth year, so the Maker WA Ellis.
However, the desire after a own house in Berkeley's capital town is a blessing, since the fulfillment payments for the termin sales are built on over 2,2 billion Â£.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand after the correct, good planned product remains stabil and, as the result, the term sells remain stabil."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new own households in the year until the end of April â€“ almost one third party more than the maximum state 2007 before the crisis.
The annual resource results increased by 40 per cent to 280 million Â£, the rate of 18 per cent to 1,6 billion Â£.
In a report on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley in the launch year would consider the current market expectations.
The analysis estimates the annual result of 450 million Â£.
Berkeley's acts stayed on the afternoon in London's trade at 23,96 Â£.

Jennifer Lawrence is coming at the 85th Oscar Disorder.
Nackt photos of the Oscar Presspaper Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker that meaned to have a "master list" of more than 100 Starlets.
A representative of the stars from the "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were really and cut off the hacker because of the "eclatant destruction of the privacy".
The authorities were notified and followed all those who continued to send the photos of Jennifer Lawrence.

The designed "masterlist" of the Hacking victim contains the name of Dutching Victor Stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It's not sure how many of the pictures really are, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" in Twitter also judged the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken years ago in the private area of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victoriaus" says that it's in the pictures of her hands and the second "These similar naked pictures of me are GEFELSCHT, people.

Exclusive exhibition from Howard Jacobson's high-level new Roman about love and letters "J".
They struck, so they could be able to describe it as well as a card that was left in the rain.
A woman said to him that he was too serious, increasing, intensive, distancy and maybe something crazy.
And then he shoot his hand.
He knew the cratzburk.
He was stealing, like in Igel, yeah.
The last sacrifice of this stakelessness was a just starting case that was a multi-provider for a length of his life in the same way, and maybe he had brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a terrified beautiful beauty with unmarried hairs and a flat heart from a town on the north island, which was even far away and rare than Port Reuben.
She came with an older conference to South, who held the cheermen for her tattoo, and he was born in a hot, but a Paradise Tale with the name of Paradise Valley.
A few years ago, no one lived in the house.
The rowers were lying, in the bowls were still springs, the necks left their springs on all windows, and believed that they heard all that, and the garden was overwhelmed with uncleanness, which looked like a rich cock.
It was like the house out of a child marriage, as so weird as locking, a garden full secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" is on the long list for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The short list is known in the next week.
Kevern had seated on the broken branches in the high grass and was unreasonablely fresh birthday. Both of them had been raised up in the service console, which enjoyed the land with an emphasisable music and employed messages, when the view of their crossed feet broke him on a old song of a longest dream, he remembered that his father would like to be closed in the house of Roldans.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their agressive agressiveness, the songs of this type were not played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was just prohibited - just not played.
It was successfully obsolved as obsolete the word.
The general mistake made what had never been made to allow and rules, and as people in the books were the billion memories of Vom-Tellers, Cookbooks and Love Rooms, they chose the ballets in the music.
In the Euphorie of the day, Kevern began playing a imaginable keyboard and in a grob-comic Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn doesn't understand that.
"This was a known song of a jazzpianist named Fat Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It was like a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told him.
If you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, you'll cost a penny.
It wasn't a very lucky game that was already, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn never heard anybody.
Jazz was, even if he wasn't prohibited directly, he wasn't played.
The improvision was not more modern.
It was just space for the only "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure to start a melodie where they would end.
Like the understanding.
His inheritability made the people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressing understanding.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fat Waller was black.
In her age, she couldn't remember at a time, in the pope cancer wasn't black.
It's wrong again, no laws or obligations.
A conform society means that each element of this society has approved the principle of grouping, thanks to those who have been loosed from the ship.
People with afro-caribian origin were approved by temperation and bodybuilding for conversation and sport, so they lie and ran them.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were intended to ensure that no family remained without functioning phone.
The rest of the Poland Community was concerned about the canalisation, and the rest of the Greeks was struck the Taller.
Those of the golfs states and the livings whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WAS GESCHEEN WAR, WENN HE THAT THAT THAT STATE-FOR-FOR-FORMATION, fearing even that the flowers would spread them as the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha Pfeiff Restaurants and were depressively depressed.
Everyone according to his ability.
When she just heard the ballacks, Ailinn fell hard to understand how the amazing words that she had already mentioned her could have been explained.
The music was the expression of love.
"These are not really crazy," said Kevern.
Except for people who are too large.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the rebeled garden gave him the threatened feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the smoking of the big cool balls.
Ailinn doesn't understand yet.
Why should your father love something so much?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he tried to put two fingers back to the lips.
She had already thought he was something sooner.
"It looked like him," he said instead.
She shoot unbelieving her head and locked the face of the Kevern.
There was nothing to see on the whole world than her uncovered white hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see otherwise.
"If you say it," says they without convincing.
But that doesn't explain why you're going to prevent me.
They looked honestly worried.
Is my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Not so directly your feet.
Maybe your kidney, a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my kids are too tired?
Do you hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just the stupid song.
He could say "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your smells are exactly the reason why you felt me," he tried it instead.
I'm a little pervers there.
That sounds not right.
It had to be funny.
When he tried to be comfortable, he often took himself in difficulties because he did not have his father as his father, as he was not on the ransom charm that he needed to be inherited in the whistles.
Maybe his father wanted to be gracious.
Maybe he wanted it, Kevern.
Instead of his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and lifted up from their lipboard, smoked the console and destroyed the wine they had drinked.
Holder blonde wine, so it was no excuse for him.
In their reputation, they appeared to smooth, like Palmweed in the sturm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason I feel perverse to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She apologized him, even because of the unnecessaryness of his words, as well as the fear that was shown in her eyes when she turned against him.
She thought he would shoot her?
She didn't tell him about the life on the cold north archipel where she was grown, but he had no doubt that it was like this.
The same rich and unnamed Ozean came here like there on the ground.
The same mistaken men, with more dicker hair and more threat after DEM WAS THE GESCHEEN WARN as they were as smugglers and trainers, went from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to lift up the hand against a woman who refused or disappointed them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a dick smoke if she didn't stop!
She was only knutish - knutchen was the most frequently used word for a erotic relationship force between men and women, a comparison to the untagged love ballets from the Konsole - they only use and then smoke.
According to Kevern's view, it was an unnecessary defense, because the nuts himself has already been a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through their body.
He went out of the lipboard like a old man.
She also felt to stay, but the wind of her threat was surprised.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know.
She saw him as he was departed - as from a room in the top steel, her fellowshipman added to him - a man, described by something he had sworn himself.
Adam left the garden, thought it.
She felt a painful pain for him and men in general, although some had lifted up their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, rejected her back, worried, disappointed, without fighting - why was it a view that she looked good to know if she could not remember the only time where she had seen such things before today?
When she was alone, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
A few years ago, Esme Nussboom worked an intelligent and occupied 32-year-year researcher in the task of Obnov, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public vote, on a short proposal on the continued violence on low and middle level in exact landscapes in which the reduction of which is not expected to be first expected to be invested in the respect of the money and energy, which were invested in the exploitation of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much have to be done yet," she wrote, "for awareness of the agressive aggressivity of a people, leaving thousands of wars and winning most of them, especially in the desert branches of the country, in which the beauty of human friendship has seen historically, instead of the high demanded churches between the hecks.
But some properties appear to be as unbelievable.
You're higher the church turm, so it seems to be less than the suffering he continues.
The population crys when hearing sensitive ballars, refers to history about overwhelmed difficulties and thinks to believe in the employees of marriage and family life, but not only the previous courage of the rural churches as well as our citizens, but there is also worthy for the existence of a new and past fight in home, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the fields.
"They have an increasing tendency to overcome," said her mentor, when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less Romans.
Esme Nussboom smelled their head.
I have to ask you, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," Esme Nussboom answered.
Are you lesbic?
Esme renewed its right to privacy and refusation of the exhibition.
Women?
Get back.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinwitz finally, "for I'm against attheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a pre-private free workplace.
We are serving a free free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and loving values can be able to destroy the results as you have proposed them.
You have clearly precursors against the church, and these things that you are called "absolute" and "roh" may be interpreted by others as a expression of natural power and vitality.
If you continue to go over, WAS GESCHEEN IST, WENN ES GESCHEEN IST, as if it would happen yesterday, it means to take its significant life force to the country.
Esme Nussboum looked about, while Rabinovitz spoke.
Besides his head, a LED-shirt in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Obnov had distributed to the country in the last fourth century or longer.
Remember your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballets, visit music, use your phone, speak, explain, listen to, apologize, apologize.
The speaking is better than the smooth, the salt word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want," Esme Nuss tree answered with a silent voice when she was sure she had spoken to the end, "and I don't say anything else than that we're not yet so effectively healthy, how we're doing ourselves.
My concern is that we may be reached without advertising how we recover the errors that have been reached to the entirely one of the entirely ones, WENN THE GESCHEEN IST.
But this time, they are not the others that we leave our weakness and our unbelievers.
Luther Rabinovitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To add an English patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you're called "errors" that may have been our grandparents or not.
You also go too far if you say that they would have released their "wet" and their "mixtures" to " others".
It should not really be necessary to remember someone in your position that we are talking about the understanding of the past, as in the protection of the present, not of "we" and " others".
There was no "we" and there was no " others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For the one, if we are honest to us," said Esme, "no part of the society can mean to have a good manner.
I don't care about anyone.
If it was bad or well done what happened, it's happening.
That was the time.
There's nothing more to say, we're alone.
And just as there is no crime to be committed, there is no crime to be offended if such a disagreement would be approved and if it gives a way to touch them.
But what is the past, if we don't learn from it?
The past serves that we forget them.
If I can say something to that,
Luther Rabinovitz left his piramides together.
"I will remember her report," he said and left them.
On the next day, when she lived as a worker, she was traveled by a motor railway, who, as the passors, was described in a kind of "brutal weight" on the feet.
There are cases.
Lesotho-Militar member says that no country has been planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the Military Representative in Lesotho tried to have planned a State State for the Government and said that they had come against the policeists who would have been proposed by the weapons of political fanatics.
President Thomas Tabane fled out of the country and shared that the army of the country were involving his office officer and established government buildings in the main city of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the limited South Africa after he had reported attentions.
The military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it was not a State State but the soldier reacted to the "politic fanatiker" whose weapons were represented by the police.
"What happened today tomorrow is that the stab of the protection forces of Lesotho, after he had received several secret services reports, that in the police acts some elements that actually wanted to wear some of the political, party-political fanatians who were quickly struggle, and he said to the Voice of America.
The South African Government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action has made the impression of a confusion.
"Though nobody has said that the Government has turned away by violence, all reports about that the activities of the protection forces of Lesotho to show signs for a State State", he said.
The speaker of the soldier of Lesotho shared on the Sunday that the soldiers returned to their catherine and the situation in the main city was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vizepremier Mothetjoya Metsing takes the Government leading during Taiwan's debtness.
Thabane shared that he believed he was because of his trial to fight corruption in the country to become a target.
In Lesotho, since June, there were great efforts after the Taiwan parliament meetings in accordance with the discussions in his uniform government.
He said that his actions would not be untermined by the Government, otherwise lowly accusations.
Production in the eurozone on a 13-month tiff
The increase in the production in the Eurozone was at the lowest point of the 13 months, as well as a exactly observed study.
The final market investment manager (PMI) was in August 50,7, after a position of 51,8 in July.
An indication over 50 has an expansion.
New tasks have returned and manufacturers in a period of increased spending between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers shall be taken before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Sunday.
The markets expected a clear plan for transition with an appropriate increase in the eurozone and the deflation deflation at an inflation ratio of 0.3%.
There are speculations that the leader of the ECB, Mario Draghi, in the past of this week, could provide further information if he is a quantitative improvement for the eurozone, in accordance with those who have been taken from the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Every though a small growth is better than no growth, the worst effects of the comprehensive economic and geopolitic unsecurities for the manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leader of economic scientists in the market.
The Fabric PMI for Germany, the largest trade partner of Russia in the EU, fell on the deepest position in 11 months with 51.4.
In the middle of the second largest economication of the block, France, the PMI was 46.9.
France remains a worried child, as well as the extent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
It indicates that the growth of the key industry mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are also not increasingly increasingly," said Dobson.
The refugee of the industry is probably the fire of the analysts expecting further monetary or fisheries.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased at 57.3, the highest level since 1999.
Howard Archer, Chef Economic Expert in IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the investment manager index of the producing water in the Eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Productors in the Eurozone are obviously difficult now because the current geopolitic spendings - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - insurance in the further difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased insurances have been clearly involved in the economy, particularly, and the confidence of the consumers, and it is likely to bring some tasks to continue or even to store, especially large tasks.
He said that it would be "forever more probable" that the ECB must finally introduce a type of QE, "because we agree that this will be limited."
The Health Year of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the family of the school has passed, as the children who are in it are still painful today.
10 years ago, more than 1,000 people from Tschechish millions were taken in a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of the children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that the world was shocked.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who have gone to death in the class room.
Just a decade after the decade of Beslan school, 334 people, including 186 children, warned the held survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic islamistic terrorists children and parents, on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, took and killed, it seemed like the evilest of the wicked.
The tragedie of West and East in Abscheu, and then turned surprisedly into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst currency.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had gone to death in the class room.
We found surprised young people who have overwhelmed the resistance, although the reminder of this terroristic hell will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That war that the Ukraine now seeks home - and in the child as they die -- now finds a end.
The girl who was photographed when trying, return to the dead school port room
She was photographed by the Russian Starfotograph Dimitri Beliako, and healed when she tried only in her underwater, to reach the deadly port room after a mine was exploded.
Aida was totally confused after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
They were both held for death, but they survived.
"A woman told me I'm going to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida once.
My feet were overwhelmed.
I stood up and fell back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her safe.
After a number of operations, she was completely held, but yesterday said, "The pain returned back for three months.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some big tickets are still in my kitchen.
Your goal is now to be a weapon to help people as you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it hasn't broken me," she says a campaign.
"This happened to me, and you can't change it.
Once in the year, I'm always going to the sport room to remember those who lived there.
My friends and I try not to talk about other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future class camera Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we dreamed to go together to school.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and start my carriers.
I think a family later.
She says that the refugee will always be a part of her, although the reminder will be a bit more difficult every year.
I'm glad that many people remember our fears in the world and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the United Kingdom and all over it.
If I see the photo from me, how I'm going back to school, I think many people see it first, understand our catastrophe and help that something happens not again.
The boy who fled through the ball, in the meaning that his mother is dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school with seven years) and survived the three - day ransom in the army of his mother Tamara.
When seven years old he said, "Mum told me, I'm going to put me up if it's a explosion, and keep their hands."
After a explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Let go."
Very afraid they could be dead, he fled and looked on the way a weeping kid, took it in his hand and flowed through a cool hair.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son outside the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was thrown outside and with stones in the hospital, whereas it was accepted that her son was over.
After her reconciliation, she said: "I prayed for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran inside and smoked me.
Damir was fled later to London (with the news of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's children's champion from the Damir Tony Blair and his wife Cherrie.
"The horror seeks you every day, but I wanted to stop the reminder," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it's gonna be slower in my memory.
I still know I've got all my game pistols right then.
But now I can play computer games with shoes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the Sport Hall, but I don't think of myself.
I remember these kids I played in the court, and they didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or died.
We say they're staying in the sport room.
I remember very well my journey to London, especially the game loads, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the travel in a open car.
But now he was afraid of a place like the Ukraine, where the wars caused the kind of disasters that he and his friends rejected.
This horror persecutes you every day, but I wanted to stop me to remember it.
"I'm so sorry about all those who hurt under the faults," said Damir, the last week worked as freedom in a closter.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me next year in school.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible silence after the battle, there was just no kids that could call and run out, and this silence had a few months.
She remembers her way alive to London with Damir.
People in London weep when I told our story.
I understand how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world, and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her stealing thanks for the price and the opportunity to go to London in 2004.
I wanted to call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kellners in a restaurant, and Damir shocked with his water pistol on her, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British had so properly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and people die every day, and I think many children are killed and are still killed.
That's exactly such children as ours.
I think for many of the war is a part of the messages that they hear when they want or are busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill themselves, and that is so sad.
Damir was big, and he is a very heavy and quiet boy, he is mostly not aggressive or wrestling.
For example, he doesn't seek race, he is not overwhelmed by the past mistakes.
I know that he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six friends from the class and they go in the sport room and dressed there.
When he was smaller, he's a little down there, I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face out of us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued all his weapons and other military games. Damir is now 17, greater than I, well-aspect, intelligent, and healthy.
I can't believe that I was so sure he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I took me after the explosion and came to the feet, I saw me around, and I saw the hell around me, with all the body parts.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could survive in this hell.
"I remember that I'm threatened to him, "Damir, go away," but I was too sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he's gone.
And then life goes, other than many others, for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy who was the terrible image after the rebellion to the icon of Beslan's wrath of Beslan
Trust: The Beslan overliving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the rebellion 2004, a picture of Georgij today
His blood overstrom face was drawn by fear when he ran over his life, while the Czech terrorists cut down his class cameras.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had set him up for his first school day before she left to bring her old son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the Hof about two minutes before the terrorists shoot him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of friends of us, but they were all killed.
Only my George made it to survive.
Besides this date, it is difficult to think and talk about it.
There is no one day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's a long time, I mean, it would happen yesterday to persecute me some scenes of these days.
Nobody will forget that, I promise you.
Finally, the image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was consistent as a state (right).
I remember that George wanted to go to school this day, he said he wanted to break his teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him in the TV.
And now there's even this state of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the image, and it's hidden with us in the bookmark.
I understand that, but I also mean that people in all the world feel like this picture of our pain.
Georgij says today, "It's important that it can never happen again.
"I'm surprising that we ever know the truth.
People are looking for such tragedy again and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the absurd of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what he's caused?
This world will be a little terrible.
"I can't understand how it is possible, for if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need twelve years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For three or four years, I had a few album rooms because of the explosion, but then it was better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and class cameras who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sport room when the first September is closer.
I want my old childfriend Tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sport hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is a part of my past.
I'm not forgetting it, but I'm not injured.
My life continues.
I've finished the school this year and visited a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be a heartchirurur.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was captured by a murder terrorist.
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was captured during the battle of a murder terrorist, but he made it to survive.
While he was captured in the sport room and sat near the bomb, which was confirmed at the foot of a murder terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We feel it like if it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as secretary, but it could not be done because of his healthy disease.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind me.
I'm elder now and people say that children can easily interact with bad experiences - I have to say that it's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - after the year - was the first and the only time I went back to the sport room.
I'm losing the consciousness.
I'm never going back there again and don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this beautiful image.
Overliving: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photograph of in the hospital after the laptop
My pain is unhearted and I'm leaving him every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
I'm fine with the body.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can go well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study the FSB secretary of the FSB in Sant Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, also the medicine, and they have replied that it is impossible.
My second suffering was the animals, so I went to the aircraft institution.
I've been there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals from cats to cook.
He said, "I knew I would never report my children about my experiences.
The children should not know anything about it, and they should not, obviously, do not be able to do it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the day of the year is closer.
I'll go to the feasts to think.
I know Georgij's not going.
It must be more heavy for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him home and couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. All of them are signed in Beslan.
It's staying in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if someone's gaining something so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't share for his knee.
He was operated more, he can run, but no sports.
I would say he's over 50% of the horror, but you can never overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the battle, and that only increases my pain.
I lost many people I know well and those who were poor to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could do to me, but my heart wept for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart broke in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world -- wars in other regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killed against themselves?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can't believe it almost.
We were a peaceful country before, how can we fight now?
Humans and children, I'm sure that many children are already killed in Ukraine and are still killed.
If we can only take all these rebelles and cut out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that has been carried out by a special adjustment
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is carried out by a Russian Special Initiative Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the gravity.
The world took the atem 2004 when Baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian police from Beslan's fighting.
The terrorists let them go, but their 30-year-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Christina and their brother Machar returned to the school port.
Machar, three years old, went out, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murder assembly.
Your father Ruslan has married again and has married with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he called his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, doesn't remember the fighting and is growing to a smart and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Machar are both beautiful children," says a friend.
Ruslan is a fantatic father, and I want to give them all the reminders that go up with the tenth year day.
They will understand why.

4 Tips for better subwater photos and videos
If you like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection on devices.
The most precise option is a desirable point-and-shoot, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action chamber, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both to have for about 300 dollars.
I took these photos at a family feast with several cameras that are all available to a price of $350.
Independently of the exploitation, there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a low-depth camera, make sure that the battery and other fabrics are closed.
Set your camera also on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and Camcorders are available on scenes and capture modes to optimize the exposure time for the dark subwater conditions.
And before you drop in, check until the depth of your exploitation is functional.
Some cameras are allowed only for 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our purchase manager and assessments for digital cameras for natural and increasing models.
Make multiple captures - because many don't be cut off.
Point-and-shoot cameras are available on a LCD with which you can compose images, normally doesn't have action rooms.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to look at it under water, and the correct image set is a happy sake.
So you're doing a lot of records.
If your camera is available on a line mode with a number of records with easy changed expression settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, and you will continue to remove yourself from the surface.
If possible, you stay close to the surface if you make captures in a pool, a sea or the sea.
So you can also take more colors into your photos; in the deep way you go, so fewer colors will be seen you.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice in the country, but it is so important for the bad light relations.
It is particularly important if you work with a action camera: these devices are often available on a fixed windwinkel line, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if you should fill all the image frames.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort of which characteristic things changed, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As ancient anxiety, he intended his carriers of the task to explore the disease agencies, as well as the qualities of treatment.
Under his patients, he remembers his wife, was a MI6 employer who had to live with the lowly effects of consequences.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important to diagnosis and diseases, while the treaters were overwhelmed with something else: pain.
However, one day in 2007, he was the one who started the way of suffering.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to call me up.
While he fighted with the gripped symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet unfortunately provoking.
"I want everything to love immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a week, Lawson felt absolutely irregularly and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to take a radian investigation of his breast.
First two weeks ago, he was in the French alpen to skip.
The result of the radian analysis was prevented.
He's a little at Mesotheliom, a unhealable cow, that's the breastfell, so he's taking the length over.
As in most diseases, the exact solvent is most difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers were sick at length crybs, they were not all the length carbon diseases previously.
But Messothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the soldier is an asbest loading - contact with the fabric that one time was known as "wunderwater" but in the middle of death.
For most of us, the Messotheleom is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbest type has been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s than the industry is freely obligated to use it.
In addition, where he was still used, only people worked directly with the substance - Klempner, building workers, room leaders and workers, for example.
As a industrial risk of another time, it seems not to be careful today.
But this self-compatibility is unnecessary.
Great Britain, so it seems to be the height of a mesoltheliom epidemium today.
There are more deaths through Messotheliom here than in all other countries of the world.
In total 2,500 death accidents per year, many people are doubled in this disease as in transport accidents.
Years numbers of mesolate-leomdrome accidents since 1980 and future death accidents in the United Kingdom
The reason why we have now experienced the dead effects, although Asbest is illegal since years (1999 were prohibited all the asbestypes), is that a Messothelium has developed himself only after decades.
And the beauty of the Mesothelium is not limited to ancient workers of the builder.
Asbest was, and often there is still in the houses where we live, the offices we work in, the schools we learn and the businesses we buy in.
And that is why Messotheliom does not know classic diseases, financial limits, calls or age.
The privileges, from the elegant buy houses in London to private schools, are no protection space.
Parliament's buildings are asbested.
Even in the hospital houses where we should be healthy, we have already been raised as the outside of this murdered carcinogenes.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clomper.
He was in fact hard to imagine where he might be in contact with Asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like in the tunnels in Guy's hospital, where I solved six years for my training, a lot of asbest exists."
All - students, hospital sisters, doctors and pants - use the tunnels.
Do you ask how many of my agegenes will be painted in the same disease?
This question could least be responsible.
"For the four doctors in the hospital in Guy's hospital, and those who were sick in Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter 2010, "I am the last one who lives."
How many of us will still be sick?
With Andrew Lawson, Messotheliom was diagnosed in 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unlikely long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all Messothelio marks die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease ends alway.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still be sick?"
The Great Britain Expert in Messotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, notes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestepedia in the United Kingdom is intended to reach, totally 90,000 of the disease will be attached to the victim.
Most of them have no idea that they're going to die so.

A short view of the acts of the grass, which often turn the concerns of the suffering requirements, shows how far the beauty of the Messothelium has already been expanded.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, made Janice Allen driving asbest.
She worked nine years long for the cat, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the routine division to two locations - one of the flagship offices in Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 years when they started their activities in M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenty-shirts.
"For this thing," she said, "I never heard of Mesothelium, I didn't even know anything about Asbest.
I never thought it would be me.
There are only few people who know much about Asbest.
The fact is that asbest is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name is raised by the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fabric structure that makes the substance to resistable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the building.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbest, is this today in the most frequently found asbest in buildings.
It was used for dackplates, footplates, rohrisolations, boiler Solutions, even for Brems packs in cars.
It is less dead than other asbest forms, but the EU and the WHO will also be considered as a "great health risk" with possible death.
But more dangerous is the brane asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (crokydolith).
Great Britain was one of the world's largest importer of braun asbest, and experts suggested that "is clear, but indirect for that it was a main reason for the only highest Messoterrates."
A collaborator of Marks & Spencer was in the Flagship office in the Oxford Street, London, Asbest, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen as a typical mesolate offer, but the work of Julian Peto shows that their history is nothing in common.
He presented a study of the concerns, in which "the major part of the Messotheliome without known execution by work or home was probably caused by asbest contact in the environment."
A majority of these contacts includes its exhibition after the "normal use and age" of our building.
It looks like no one can get out of it to be safe.
A report of Goddard Consulting, who has investigated the Palast of Westminster, shows how people could be made in the heart of the Government, unbelievablely to the substance.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the services officers and rural leaderships were tried after the Committees of the Asbest, which could have been affected by the killing phases by something so harmless as "sufficient air movements".
Parliament's members are often accused to take care of their own interests, but here it seems to be as a result of the corresponding part.
While the Secretary-General of the Parliament's Work Service concluded that the Westminster Palast has received a "sufficient health product", it is increasing that 1 billion billion billion billion billion billion employment should be established in order to renew the Parliament to modernize the electroinstallations and remove the Asbest, and that after the general elections 2015, the reports will be considered closer to the close QE2 Conference Centre than on the Green Brokens in Westminus.
The report of Goddard also said that "the existence of Asbest was not undertaken in accordance with the appropriate provisions."
Nobody can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is waiting.
A person who could never identify the contact with Asbest was Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old absorbed that he had been made in hospitals during his work.
"I worked in a hospital, which was positively resolved in the assessment club," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked, and the data.
What he still remembered is the day in the beginning of December 2009, where he got such a kind of fiber.
He was 45, and he led a operation later night.
I've had a shootfreast in the same time.
It's all overwhelmed.
I felt scared.
I believed no longer to build the travel to home.
As the doctor knew that the pains of the brushfell, the hair around his length.
But as Janice Allen, he didn't have reason to make a mesothelium.
He didn't work a month.
The surprised doctors made the rates of his breast and set Pleurakathether to remove flexibility from the length and test in the laboratory.
However, his concerns remained without diagnosis.
His health improved suddenly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, the symptoms returned from time to time, often after sport attemption and heavy atmen.
A patient Abbotts came in 2011 with similar symptoms in his practice and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom.
But now it isn't connected with its own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades old and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state returned, and his marriage brought his CT scans and rounds to an expert group.
In December 2011, two years after Abbott felt at first sick, one camera was introduced in the holes between the ripe and the brustfell.
I'm a optimist.
I'm doing more simple," he says.
Really, I didn't have so much worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between birthdays and new years ago, "Man told me that it was Mesothelium."
Graham Abbott: Diagnose Mesotheliom
Unfortunately, there was an abstract date with Macmillan hospital sisters, which one recommended him to take a lawyer.
First now, he took the extent of the epidemia.
"It appeared that Asbest was very wide, especially in large public buildings where the rohre often was isolated with Asbest," he said.
The people who were carried out the asbest in these buildings are now sick now.
And now the Messotheliom tries young people who have not worked in the typical calls.
The most dangerous rows with asbestisolation in hospitals were located under the earth, so the patients were probably not exhausted by the substance.
But many cooperators who were moved to a build to others (like Andrew Lawson) or in the suburbs (come Graham Abbott often did) came to contact with the future substances.
It shows that over several decades after the war of hospitals for patients were possiblely living, but livingly for the treated doctors.
He will also be removed today.
Learns put their bunch burners on asbestmates.
And it's not only hospital houses.
Asbest was usually used in offices, businesses, libraries and cities because of his fabelly isolated and flamble properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have already had the first asbest contact in the class room.
All in the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have cut down their bunsen burners on asbest.
On the website, the theme Asbest is now often called in schools.
And that is because of such innocent circumstances in our houses, such as footplates or shops, have contained standardly asbest.
"It's a industry that contains in large parts of our immobility," noted Andrew Morgan, the law law law law law law lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's hospital.
In one case, it was the only contact that affected a woman, the absence of a garden shop in the 1970s.
So guess how you get your garden shops.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is inevitable is immense.
"It's a time to process it," said Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I knew that I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew I was going and I had to worry about myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live any more Friday.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change was from the position of a doctor to a patient.
How many patients before him remember how he was overwhelmed from all the information he had to come right to him.
"It was very hard to take everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long have I yet?"
And I gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Yes, I'm not gonna live any more Friday.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is especially home-time, because it's our life-management mechanism - the atmen itself - is that the dead blood is caused.
Most cases of Messothelio are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest is from the smallest phases.
When the asbest is infected and the fases are contained, they can set themselves in the brown field, the hair around the lengths.
Asbest fabrics irritate the breastfell and can solve cell mutations.
"The problem is with the contained neighborhood fases", so Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor, who changed the Guy's hospital 2001.
Just the hospital, by Andrew Lawson, convinced that it has made it to the asbest, is now ironically, a leader centre in the treatment of Messotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some of the others, likely, during their training in the hospital.
While the asbestnadels are achieved, treasure says, "when they are pressed from the attempt to the border where the hair is.
From nature it is from the beginning to invasive.
The normal options in other carbon diseases do not work so well at Mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of a operation is heavy.
Some think they're a trial.
The treasure disappoints it.
"Man can't cut out the breastfell," he said.
They don't come in with the ship.
That's why the chemotherapie says "not very good to chemotherapie," the "screaming" but not healed.
"It's sometimes there's a long-term overliving," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Happyly, some patients live really long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two-minute years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came to contact Andrew Lawson, who became an in-man support and consultation office for cooperation four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, blood center," he said, "Good to call.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had his diagnosis four years ago and was still very active.
Originally Abbott was offered six chemotherapecycles, which remained four months and, likely, would only have been long for a month.
"I was witched," he said.
I wanted to leave it.
However, Lawson made it "the things appear to be in a positive light."
After consultation, several doctors decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, the heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a part of that I didn't have to continue, I just called and got a date," says Graham.
A normal patient should receive a review and should wait for the authorisation of the treatment.
The money is essential for the mesotheliom patients to be able to prevent the best available therapies.
But if these treatments endlessly miss, many concerns have been involved by another financial concern - about the future of the families who have left them.
And then they will turn to the faults in the hope of disagreement.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It is known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that you recognize that there is also a very small health risk.
And here began to play a role for the sustainability of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital finally set their cases, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-valuable disagreement" because Lawson could not prove absolutely safe that his Messothelem was to bring back to a asbest contact on Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a Guy's speaker confirmed that "the assessors were removed in the field of the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How Asbest can be removed
In fact, it is a great problem to attach the mortal asbest contact to a company or a workplace - usually ten years after the events.
Many of their previous employees are sold or closed.
Consequences may lose.
And those who turn against their responsibility know that the time is for them, but surely not with the men.
As a reaction on this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for the Mezotheliom concerns, even though their previous workers are not found anymore.
The law has promoted 350 million Â£ funds of the security industry for all that were diagnosed after July 2012, can show a contact, but no one can declare.
In these cases, the customers receive 80 percent of what a court could have been made to talk to them in a normal disaster process - about 120,000 Â£.
Some 300 successful applications will be expected for year.
Andrew Morgan thinks how many Messotheliom involved that 350 million Â£ was a "best good job" of the security market.
"This is a part of ensuring guarantees for security", says he, and indicates that it works in this sum about a quarter of what the security had to pay if the time would not have gone out of it and the Messotheleom's disease finds the companies and could normally pay them.
Mike Penning, the Ministry of Working and Pension, also said that the law was not perfect.
But even Penning, as Morgan, gave it that the view of seven death sacrifices each day needed a fast trade.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second audience of the Mesotheliom Meeting in December of the past year.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski since 19 months.
After its first advice, Lang-Lazdunski recommended a operation from which he expected a positive effect in accordance with Tom Treasure.
This has been joined by a trail treatment and a chemotherapie - a trial treatment, with the long-lazdunski can present a over-5 years from to 40%.
Abbott felt strong.
"It's of course the most important," said Abbott.
You're always looking at the patients again.
There's something that lets you continue.
If you're getting up, you're very faster.
Graham Abbott was submitted to the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last six chemotherapycycles behind him.
The postergescans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There's been several cocks around my breast.
I was just 50.
It's not living.
That's alive.
Abbott also submitted six chemotherapycycles.
Now, there's no smoke of the tumor more visible.
But the process is physical and psychically very intensive.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boilway sets.
If you get bad messages, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he said.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girlfriend that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very selfish and unclean.
She told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was back.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all blood patients need to be trained.
But for Messothelio marks, such conversations are not through hope, not by a speech of hope to survive.
The disease (as as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grimful security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not living.
Bodies in balsamed farmers in asbest clothing
Asbest phases used for strengthening cooking hairs and a greater hitze competence.
Plinius of the elders describes Asbest.
It was developed a weapon that it is not burnable.
I've seen the service at the feasts in the cabinas.
The use of the modern commercial asbest begins in Italy where it is used to produce paper (including money) and substance.
Important asbests are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation substance for explosion machines and turbines of industrial revolution.
The global asbest production increases more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
Statistics of Prudential identifies an early deathrate with those who work with Asbest, and they do not get any more of life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw died in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke says that the Asbest party in the long, "No doubt, the main dead causes."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employer, Turner Bros Asbestos, doesn't take capture.
It will not be paid.
During the Second World War, ships will be built intensively, one of the most dead ships with asbest contact.
Free review of the branch on the import of blue asbest
An employment Court confirms the first successful staff in the United Kingdom for contacts with Asbest.
The global asbest production increases more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
Great Britain imports 139,000 tons.
A health and security sequence in the United Kingdom commits all companies working with Asbest to license.
The import and use of blue and brune asbest are legally prohibited in the United Kingdom.
Each use of Asbest is prohibited in the United Kingdom.
The Messotheliom Composition is agreed in the United Kingdom.
A 350 million Â£ disappearance program is announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, however, the white asbest is still used in many countries of the earth as precise ground material.
The global production is at about 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses Hong Kong law to government election, Demonstrants swear reward
On the Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, instead of the decreased call on democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the Hong Kong election.
This procedure is probably recommended by the long-term protests in Hong Kong's business office, while activists lead to the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the refugee.
The decision of the Chinese People Congress allows the communist leaders to deny non-country candidates.
"This is not expected, but it makes us weird," said the jurisdiction expert Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
You have anglogened the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with a authorised regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vicegeneral Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the choices for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotical".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom had rejected the control on Hong Kong to China, Peking promised that the inhabitants were chosen to the Government President since 2017.
The Chinese rule predicted the decision from the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, since it has a direct choice to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership contains the decline by a peking controlled nomination committee.
After a new clousel, only candidates should be allowed to "with love to country and love in Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the most largest and published protests in Hong Kong have been located a few years ago.
Besides the prodemokratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which organizators have made it to cut off the financial cycle if Peking does not allow real general election.
In the Sunday age, hundreds of Occupy Central Attaggers were gathered in the rain before the Government's headquarters in Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organizators said that their move had a new level of injustice and planted them in the next weeks of protests.
However, they did no further information, likely to disappear problems with the authorities.
In a online communication, the organizators shared that the movement "the establishment of the Central Circle has only gone into consideration, an action that only should be found if all dialogue changings are exhausted and there are no other choices.
We're sorry to say that all dialogue cancers have been exhausted today and the establishment of the Centre Area will be permanently located.
The authorities in Hong Kong are prepared for the advice of Beijing since days, and on the Sunday before the Government Building Affairs, including policy and barrikades.
The rebellions will be strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong to lose the control of their city soon.
The contribution of humans from the Festival countries increases the competition on products and services.
Furthermore, the fear is that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and speak freedom, starts to breathe under the growing pressure of Pekings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Centre movement because they had the business operation - the livesader Hong Kongs - risks.
"The protests of which they speak could make great economic pains after how much they are participated and how long they walk," said the jurisdiction expert Regine Ip, which criticized the movement since long.
We don't want to make fears that Hong Kong will save control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The State controlled medias of China also reported unfortunately about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as the subversive agents of the western powers.
In this sommer, a non-official reference to the election rights in which 780,000 people shared - more than a fifth of the choices in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands participated in one of the most democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school conclusions in the United States will now be transferred to the universities where freshmen are offered by the private airport.
We are glad to respond to these questions and to offer the first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to make a specially impressive approach to the university, the company also offers transport options such as privacy airports, Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a security party.
This service is a ideal alternative for students who have to kiss their hazards in a dangerous transport car through the country.
Along with our new VIF options, we are pleased to be surprised in this year for the students to get the university at a minimum level and a maximum to Luxus.
A company talker said that there were no new books proposed, since the service was already introduced, but added that "Studiers would book the service in the next week."
The company also shared that, although the study payments of 9,000 Â£ per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and questions from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than to make a great first impression, and with VIF can exactly.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for high school education said: "This offer seems totally separated from the life of most students.
Many students starting this month with the study seems to have a crisis of lifehold costs, since the available financial assistance in the form of credits and staffs does not hold the strong accounts for the simplest lifebased basis before they are able to think of it, thousands of Â£ for something easierly as the accommodation in the studio house.
Feminists criticize races and police treatment after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed in the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants took their hands into the air and singed, "Handle high, not shoot," while they waited before the preaching.
After two weeks, Protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed Teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
Following their experience, white feminist commentars, the community will be intended to address the rights of reproduction and the equality of income.
However, while the springs in the Middle Occident increased and obtained in all the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% to the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shoes of 9 August, the personal tests came with titles such as "the thoughts of Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism turns not only to the expression of women."
But Perez means that it was a important change.
"I don't think you find many people who are white and speak privileges in so high classic kind," said she.
People felt that they had to say something to the cases.
It is characteristics for the crisis where we are, and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express it.
For the English Professor Coritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems on the light which black Americans have been issued each day, but not as "frauenthemes" in the cultural room.
"I can publish something lucky on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 likes from all this," said Mitchell.
If I guess something about how farms are standing in their own country, it's the smoking ornamental.
"How can it be sure for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not on security in the public room?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who studied race, family and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and generation problems.
For them, black women did not have Luxus to separate the subjects sauber; they live every day in the combinated reality.
While white women are now connecting the subjects of race and generation in the feminist mainstreams, Angela Hattery, Professor for women and family research at George Mason University, said that their advantages did the same part.
"Which between 1865 and 1890 were at least 10,000 black men, and the foundation was almost always the administration of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the history to justify the killer of Lynch.
For Hattery, the column between white and black women came on the point where the white fighters for women's choice rights like Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the past years of the 19th century and determined that the fight for the election right only could be successful for a group: women or black.
"They tried to take the decision for women's choice right, and the choice of black should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, one will be known with power why colored women are not trusted in white women.
We didn't do our job.
We have never helped black women to protect their wives and sons.
Moreover, after women received the choice, it was still a decade until white women were organized in the Association of Southern Women for the prevention of Lynching.
The group was almost 40 years after the original request for help of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the air is the white feminist reactions on the issues made by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - a speed of the time in which white feminists played with the problems with which black women were set out from generations.
"Isn't good if the activityists who have such traditional femalistic platforms have the right to reach a child as serious as they do it with the right to reception control?", Mr. Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who build their carriers on the fight against the reproduction rights and the access to recipient media are now trying to understand what it means.
The known white feminist activists Gloria Steinem went two weeks after Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article from Rebecca Carroll, Colomnist of the Guardian, in which he requires more protests of white Americans to rassism.
"I hope that women who have another, but the parallel reason to understand a risk involving the body - and the opinions of the race that are clearly different in public discussions - the changes will be leading," wrote Steinem.
Although stone is for a higher intersectional feminism, in the race-like theme, some of their comments to the rasenhema in America are not yet delighted.
Christina Sommers, researcher in the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to she The People that young men in the United States, especially young people colored men, "except worse than their sisters," but Steinem's comments in Ferguson are in the context of their previous crisis.
Now there are hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but nearly nothing for children.
But when the white house recently was a small program, my brother's Keeper, was resolved to help the fair young and Spanish men, it had severe reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the Black Community is not the only problem that the mainstreamfeminism is in the front of the mainstream.
After the U.S. Green Police has attacked almost 63,000 minor years in the southwest border of the country in this year, the subject of the investment reform is reiterated to the surface - this time as a woman's subject.
Andrea Mercado, Co-President of We Belong Together, a organization mobilised women for the innovation reform, said that for a review of the subject as a significant woman theme they only need to publish the story of inhabitants.
"This speaks for yourself," said Mercado.
If the large number of worksviews goes to men who are involved, the women who are associated are in a position where they are delayed for the main violence and expression.
"This story finds a reach in the women's organizations," she said.

Especially impressed was the approach of the "Retiarius", which struggled with whirlfnetz, trizack and dolch against the "secutor" and after a short battle struck the burdens to the ground.
Thus, the swords were metallically to each other, the shields cut off and the whirlwind flowed out by the Arena that a fear and availability could be made for the health of the Gladiators.
But on the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular shoe judge, a very careful eye.

After two years of preparation, a "oppidum Romanum" city was set out from the free-time park for a day, as Mr. Claus Wehage was established in his basic word.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought wars and production in our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings we are still wondering.
The rest of it was also to exist during the Roman day, as well as "Aquadukt Marmor" from 11 meters high and 1400 meters of long romarkanal bridges, which were at least at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus society established the water and energy care and now, and the employer Petera Fricke knew, "We're going to use today more benefits from the knowledge of that time."

You have found the surface walls of a economic building with a darre to treat and marriage.
The building probably had a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, explained the archeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of funds from these explosions set them in a glass-vitrine, including a large celler, multiple hot glass steel and parts of a rare steel.
The Villa has already existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the incident of the Germans in the Roman Roman Romans, the Morschei.
With her children also worked with the Roman windsmill game, like todayâ€™s muscle game, or they wrote their names with metal balls on the boards of the Roman schools.
On the position of the Roman Zellpech, the children of Mosaic were able to put the Mosaic children on the position of the glassum Rheinbach glucose and served a hard steel of stone to make the meal for a flood bread or a musli.

Ebola: Epidemia is carried out West African Economic
Ebola epidemia in West Africa is also a serious threat for the economy.
The markets are disappeared - and international enterprises are on a distance.
The Ebola Epidemia, the West African Economic, moves a serious threat.
The erect is cut down on the fields that mines are left and the markets are disappeared - the virus has set severely allowed the region.
There are also some international enterprises already a distance.
"The Ebola Epidemia is not only a medical crisis, but also a economic crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the worst involved
"It's a total catastrophe, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia Maintown Monrovia clothing.
On the market, only who wants to buy food or something to deinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been achieved at the highest of the virus, alone here fell down the fireer more than 600 people to the victim.
The health authorities often explained that the disease has been proceeded in each angle of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have expanded the virus.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others touched themselves.
Foreign companies take cooperators from
In all areas of resource countries, enterprises have their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Stahl Concerns Arcelor Medtal are disappeared by their representatives, and several international aircraft companys are no longer attached to the areas concerned.
The inhabitants and builders also react: only a few buying leaders leave their homeholders to buy.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under the Carantenian, the important cacao and coffee bowls were broken on the fields.
The buildings don't want to leave their home for the heat.
Food food buttons
"The people will always travel less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Pariser Experts for the Western African Economic.
For example, the man who usually goes on the market and sells his meats, is likely to stay home.
The population therefore reaches the consequences of the epidemia directly and severe: foods will be pressed.
On the markets, the proposal raises basic foods such as the road.
In the same way, the strong region depending on international companies has become an image train - with a lot of rich consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies are based on long-term, Philippe Hugon says about the French Think Tank Iris.
It is important to be how long and how long the virus will still be expanded.
Investors may be the impression, "the dangerous thing is to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and also investment," Hugon warned.
The disease also carries the strapaced State households of the States
The disease is also carried out the non-strategic state households of the Member States concerned.

The effects are also already in Nigeria, where only few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Moreover, the merchant region is not involved in the southern Nigerdelta.
Yet, in other ways, many people are already in fear of a stealing house.

Genetic smoking often diagnosed
A British says she thought as a result of a failure diagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the faith that she had been almost few years after she was diagnosed with another sickness.
It is actually a little at Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of heroes that hurt the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK shared that false diagnosis is a frequency problem with people with CMT because it is so much known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom may suffer CMT that can lead to motor disturbations such as muscle swallows, an increasing train and crushed shadows.
The diseases are also painful in favourite feelings or diseases. The disease is insanitable and progressive, which means that symptoms will be worse with the time.
As Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was in peace atacs (FA) - a disease with very bad survival opportunities.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the rollboard before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years old today said, "I knew that I couldn't do the same as the others.
I always fell down, and everything was longer with me.
I could never go with the other children of Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often in school to go and run.
Rodgers said that in 13 years after several operations for the discharge of their assessment and the smoking of their feet, she saw her sick acts when her doctor left the room and read that she had a little FA.
"I felt guilty because I was nervous, so I told no one, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and throwed up in Panik.
I thought I would be 18 in the role scroll and die with 25, and soon all my ability would lose.
I made all this alone with me and planted my own age.
She said, when she was 17, she was clear that her capacity had not been taken so strong as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and threw me up and said, "My love, I don't think you'd have that, if you'd be in the roleboard."
I think you've got something weird less of life.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was determined.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a guest," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awareness monate to note this disease.

Implementation of business leaders in Washington is increased with the economic maintenance
Economic growth means more customers, more sellings and new jobs.
It also means higher controls.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country in the past year, while economic growth was declined, so a new published study in the past week, and the firms in Washington room did not be exclusive.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia were payed together $27.6 billion to state and local posts in 2013, a increase of $3.8 per cent in 2012 to $26.6 billion.
The state and local rate of the company increased 4,3 per cent of $671 billion in the last year, compared to 3,9 per cent in the year before, and it was the third growth year after the number of years in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than the local payments for 4,3 per cent, so the study conducted by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the State Management Centre, was carried out by a staff policy group.
More than half of the district 56 per cent of the steadfast measures are from the company management, while 36 per cent of Maryland's enterprises are exceeded.
Virginia offers 28 per cent the less stealing measures from the company.
A majority of the growth in the steering measures is based on the increase of the immobilial values of the company, the researcher says that 3,7 per cent in this year after the three of the following years, with less than 1 per cent of growth.
While a large part of this wine from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems to be accessed to the Washington room.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia were totally paid over 10 billion dollars to the state and local immobilization in the past year, compared to $9,6 billion 2012 - a increase in a year's rate of $4,2 per cent.
However, the appearance of the immobilial values in Maryland is not so effective in the increase of state and local tax measures, since the immobiliarity controls are achieved here to be more than a fifth of the steadfasts of enterprises.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half their state and local assets in form of immobiliating controls.
"In Maryland, a large part of the immobilities, especially in the D.C., is in the possession of the Government or of non-profit organizations that don't pay immobiliary support," said Douglas Lindholm, the officer of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore urged to leave more on the income offices to provide the same services to offer other States.
The latest increase in steering by companies can not be calculated only by the increase of the immobiliar market.
Companies have also seen to obtain the data.
Companies in the region reported income management in state organizations of $2.3 billion in comparison to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion dollars in enterprise income, the highest payment of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local rate charge for enterprises is not equally in all three areas.
The growth ratio in the District consists of 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was clearly higher, 4,9 per cent.
Only Virginia has reported a subterraneous rate of 4,1 per cent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three office areas of the most smallest enterprise income (in all three there are fixed undertakings).
The undertakings in Maryland are at 8,25 percent and in the district in relationship with 9,975 percent.
A comparable study of the United States Handle campaign at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, smaller and local enterprises were required and a better steel climate in Maryland.
The District was not investigated in the study.
However, Virginia is pressed by his southern neighbors.
North Carolina has agreed the laws for the reduction of its companies in this year of 6,9 per cent to 6 per cent, the same stage as Virginia, and the stage will be raised to 5 per cent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income objectives in the next year, this law could reduce the companies income to 2017 to 3 per cent.
In the meantime, it seems to go better to the small employees in Washington room, and therefore they pay more state and local offices, so the latest study.
Companies, which are paid as a personal income control by small business leaders - a transition structure which has been organized by most small companies - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased 20 per cent to 2,4 billion dollars, a clear faster growth ratio than the companies.
Researchers say that the trend and the growth of enterprises in the entire country will possibly be maintained in this year with a increase of general multi-creasing measures for the State and the local governments of 6,2 per cent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison to the same period of the previous year.
However, the room of Washington may take place if the output of the Agreement Government affects the employment market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hopfen and Malz - a loved combination in China.
The German Beer in China is an exciting call.
Frankfurt's partner town in China now wants a bravery and hopes also a airport connection between the two cities.
German Beer, held in Frankfurt's partnertown Guangzhou - thus the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German branch would leave down in our city," said the Vize-Party Secretary of the South China Metropole, Li Onei, in this week when a SPD delegation is visited in his city.
The official of the Governing Communist Party of China has always returned back in the conversation on this approach of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, who is also called Kanton, is one of the richest cities of China, warb Li.
Thus, people also have the power of buying German beer.
The Chessical SPD president Thorsten Scarter, who led the German political delegation, said to the guests that he will be listed to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"To beer it doesn't need much: good water, treatment and life joy," he added to the party in Guangzhou.
This happiness of life has already exposed Mr. Li, and he smiled the guest.
Afterward, the functioner from Guangzhou with scarf branches - however, with red wine served for food.
The Chinese mark Tsingtao returns to German braukunst.
Tsingtao-Bir is taken after the German cleaning order.
More business trading
A second desire of the Chinese guests would be a airport connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-party Li.
The airport had offered the airport before, but in 2012, it was restricted for economic reasons.
"It would be recompensed," the communist policy said.
"The business trade between our two cities continues to take."
Today, I need to take the road on Changsha in Hunan Province, Li.
In addition, the Government of the Province Guangdong, which is the main city of Guangzhou, hopes for air connection.
The Vize Gubernator of the Province, Chen Yunxian, made this desire in his conversation with the social democratics in the front.
"This is a very good idea," replied the chinesian Vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany.
Partnership employed
The leading Vize Party of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership.
Li Somei was already on Main, but yet not in this function.
He just came to the office in this year after his proceeders were promoted by corruption proposals from the office.
The local party Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the functioners of Guangzhou is part of a countrywide campaign against the corruption in Partei and administration, which is carried out by Stat Xi Jinping.
The new Spitze Political Li Onei had worked before his participants for an American company, which is most irregularly in the communist party of China.
Before his officer in Guangzhou, he was working as a Spitze functioner in Fujian, where the autobuyer VW made a great work.
Frankfurt has been officially entered more than a thousand town partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers remote Guangzhou is to those who are based on both sides, either with a school board.
In the past year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was held.
The south-Chinese metropole in Perlfluss is almost as strong as the entire steel.
In the next year, it wants to get a Bruttoinland product of 250 billion euro, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "prints the dares"
Joan Rivers has been unknown since her income to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has now been hoped that the 81-year-year-old committee has received her disease.
"Thanks for your long-term love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pressing the drops.
Her mother was given sources on Sunday after a accident in a heart-station clinic at the top East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, to the Mount Sinai hospital.
The doctors keep their seats in respect and under exact observation until they are satisfied with their status, which continues to be described as "terst".
The reactions came from many pages, also in the form of a surfaced online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental friendly ships and increased lens
For cars and ships that come from today into the trade are currently stricter environment standards.
Like coffee rings and wax machines, new stickers have received a label on which the buyer can recognize central data as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, "Euro 6" steckoxid values are applied in the shame class "Euro 6".
Furthermore, there are more money for the steel building: they have a lot of largely amount of a minimum rate of 10,25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information had reported on Monday Morning: The online units manufacturer - and video products, and a number of other things - buys the videostreaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement is surprised not because no one had expected a twitch transfer, but because it was longer convinced that YouTube would reach the company.
Three months ago, it seemed like the sale of Twitch to the Google video service for a coole billion, and the cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, based on three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a life version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quick to a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravours in games, a "Youtube for Live Games", such a inside.
The twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video-general, in which the best-wide games (the most old) play a grieve of secret science teater, are already very loved on YouTube.
It is also called YouTube often if you want to describe twitch, so the message that you wanted to buy twitch is taken something worthy, a teacher example of an earlier technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a reason why the business has not been made with YouTube because the company has been ready to pay much as Amazon.
All we know now is this opinion of Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us to get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly said, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs, as I, who explain that they love sports more than that, it is difficult to understand the attraction that appears to see others in playing, instead of take the control console into the hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend at 3:00 tomorrow on the shoes, while she's worse by resident Evil, and something else to look at a spider, how he's 20 times after one in Call of Duty's head.
All these games can be looking at now.
Another problem is that many of the most favorite games are Ego games today, so the view may be a good receipt for head pains without own control over the views.
I admire that the quick tracks in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic ages solve all games in record time.
But as long as a game or humor virus is there, his twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do the Skepticker knows like I've already been there?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transport points.
And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from that?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch will be integrated so elegantely in Amazon Instant video, how YouTube Twitch could just lock.
But Twitch has something that each companie would like: thousands of young men who are turned to a construction.
As the President of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "flow both to the future of the Gaming", and the media does not show signs of a smoking, yet not - clock - as a supervisor port.
On the Hopfburg at the Burggarten feast, there were some in the Sunday.
The concept of the constituent was true.
Instead of the strong rain guest in the Same Stage, 1200 musicfans came to the open air feast in Burggarten.
Timely the insert should be stopped.
"This was worse," said Ron Sem, one of the organizators.
Salzwedel l light and happy.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
For the Open Air in Salzwedeler Burggarts will spread light on day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the pleasure even comes from alone.
This was already shown on the early Sunday when the first visitors were opened to open air.
A festival for all generations the organizators had promised.
And that's what they learned.
In the area of the fields of the Burggarten weather, there were also rooms from the nearest and more environments.
They persecuted the first live-authority, wipped with the foot in the tattoo, smoothed cutting - short: exposure pure and Genuss were assigned.
And that's what you want through the generations.
While one on the deck on the extra white white sand in the streambar, others lived in a fourth wine in the wine, the survey in the topfburg, which was a great point of relationship for the small guests.
But even when children smiles, the free helpers had the most real meaning of the word to do all the hands full to become Lord Andrang and to buy fantastic creations in the small faces.
The largers used the kickertics or participated in a scateboard workshop that equipped the Goodfoot Crew from saltwealth.
Before the great rain comes.
Before 17:30, he split down the visitors, before all families looking for the wedding and crawls.
However, the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt.
"It came more people than waiting," said Ron Sem, "the success of a whole line."
That is why a repeating of the big party in the next year is nothing.
While the contents and sizes of the event must be still worked, Sam made clearly the first balance on the Sunday against the people's sounds.
It was increasingly indicated that the insight should be stopped during the time.
Obviously, the security company was required to be too few powers.
The consequences: Some who have already paid have no longer come to the payment.
The resonance was very good.
In a first preserved estimation, the Salzwedeler Mitorganisator said about 1200 visitors in the Burggart.
There were problems in the tunnel engine.
The Salzwededler Hip-hop Blocks'n'Rox denied their progress.
Technicals were not able to create a half-way sound.
The planned Shisha-lounges could not be built because the cells were not able to be brought to the salt wealth.
"The next year, but they will be there," says the constitutor.
The primary of the Amula Open Airs was more than the visitor numbers.
And that's in bad weather.
However, the events have occurred some errors that have been retrieved at the first time, but the second arrangement should be rejected.
Also in the Facebook social network, the eventually criticism needs to be included.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you've just expected more," Melanie Meier appears on the event page.
"I'm sorry you have taken a little bit," says El Zimmermann at the same place.
Others don't see the starting problems.
I think it's very good that some are not just stupid kitchens, but really try to put something on the feet.
Shut up!", Stephanie writes JeÃŸ to the Amula.
Now the events remain a year of time to decline these critical points.
New Radom in Bergum: Watberg's True Signs broken
It's not so expected.
Moreover, the preparation of the building part is expected to be used in the marketing building.
The action is in the context of a greater measure: Fifty-50 years after the establishment of the World Observatory Council of TIRA will be renewed completely.
The new radon will be smaller than the old.
The size remains still in the world record.
The last step for the completion of the new held is the captain steel
The top quarter of the old held is declined and taken with a crown.
Then the last quarter of the new hell will be established.
If the weather is joined, the action should go over the balls at the beginning of this week.
A participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge is disappointed
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom cried so much when her unknown water was gathered over the head that she had lost the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was hurtful.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had written so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge, that she was cut off the kicker.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom growed so much when her unfaithful water was bound over the head that she destroyed her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did it, my kiefer stayed just," she said to the Mirror.
Eiswater is protected over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to shut my mouth, but it wasn't going, the kicker was cut off, and then I realized something wasn't right.
My mother and my sister saw it too, and they made it almost in the house, but I had to be in the need.
The 20-year-old-year-old-year-old Britannia was introduced into the hospital to resume the kiefer after the participation at the virtual trend on Sunday.
The Clip was linked to a Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the Burgverine soon back to a streng?
Lastly, there was a difference between the two Wolfrats Houses Burgverine.
Now, I think the conditions of a possible cooperation.
As a picture for the rebuilding of Wolfratshauser Burg, the dead Richard Dimbath, ancient president of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, the project in French Guadelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the City and the townfriend Wolfrets House.
The explanations appeared differently until the positions, such as the story of the Wolfrats House and a possible rebuilding.
Now the two layers are moved to each other: It should be already talked about a common procedure.
This confirms the United States Torsten SjÃ¶berg and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on our magazine questions.
"I have called Mr. Piffl and proposed that we could make us together once," says SjÃ¶berg.
In his view, all members of the United States may return to the future to a street.
So quickly to describe visible successs.
While the Burgfreunde for the finally dead Richard Dimbath's rebuilding at the mountwald's eye was the "exclusion and exemption" of the resident's first place for the Burgfreunde to SjÃ¶berg.
Herbert Piffl, the second President of the Burgfreunde, was very happy after its own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's predicted to the townfriends.
A new president shall be found in a member congregation in the middle of September.
The Agreement is now numbered by the 74-year-old age of 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have left the uniform activities from respect first." This "Denkphase" was needed to "commit how it could continue."
By Piffl, the new Chairman will then go to the talk with the town.
Before this, the Burgfreunde could also make a current voting image within their grouping.
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet, says Piffl.
"But I'm surprised that someone will be found." He doesn't want to candid himself because he has his apartment in Bad Tulz.
The new president should be a Wolfrat House.
The tailer wants to continue to cooperate with the project "but it's very nice to continue."
The various positions in matters Rebuilding will even remain in the eyes of Piffls at the next time.
He warms Dimbath as "Missionar", who always believed in the rebuilding of the Burg.
Two similar projects, already progressed in Austria and France, would show that this idea is no air consumption.
By a high participation of the population, and by free helpers of all the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I also was skeptical at the beginning.
But during the time, I have been more and more to convince that it is essential to prevent the project." It may be created a "allocation mark" for the flow.
There's nothing else here.
Moreover, the project would be financed by EU commitments, visitors tags and potential sponsors, believed by Piffl.
"The idea of the rebuilding I don't really want to move on the boat." He hopes that the Burg Federation may be moved something in this point.
The goal to document the story first, "it's important and good."
Then you could keep seeing it.
Clear paths to spread in Uni teachers
Since the costs for university books for more than 1000 dollars per year, Matt Schroeder was a clear Sparide.
He found a lie system for books of students higher semester and urged a nominal disorder to refuse the refrigerator.
"My mathematical book usually costs 180 dollars, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-kick", said Schroeder, 19 who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cut him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The college leadership shared the students in the middle of $1,200 per year for teachers and studies materials, however, that the students give various cost-dependence options.
Online loads and creativities such as the rollers are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
The setting of teachers is loved, and so students can use a book a semester long, often to a clearer price than to buy.
Nebo Inc, which is related to more than 250 university books, shared that the position of text books has doubled since 2011.
Questions in the branch show that a quarter of the books in the College Books in the past year's master said Nebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teachers are buyed after the commitment of the trade unit National Association of College Stors in Campus books.
This is the one for the best deal.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus books.
The new output of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290, however, with the specialised teacher of the Chegg.com for $239,99.
Buy used
If one does not exceed the notes of other or normal use requirements, the books are needed to be a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have 93,49 dollars on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, conclusive student at the Brigham Young University, says that he issued on Amazon.com 42 Cents for a useful output of "Strategic Media Decisions: Comprehensive The Business End of The Advertising Business".
The book was sold new for $48.
Academic, such as Ingrid Bracey, leader of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenditure are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditures may often be offered for a fragment of costs for the most recent expenditure.
Except Chegg and Amazon is also half.com of eBay Inc, a favorite alternative for books used.
Initiates
The setting of teachers is a valuable explanation if you treat them well, thinking to leave them back and you don't want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new buying book.
A student, for example, could be "Calculus" for the length of a semester for about 20 dollars.
Report the provisions of the business in which you are concerned, as well as the offences that apply for the writers of notes, substractions or applications.
Myter upset: If you don't leave the book, the criminals can override the price of a new book even.
E-books
E-books are also an option in place of original teachers.
Sometimes these books will be measuring the facto by providing an electronic licence for a specific period of grand-hows such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
With Chegg you can take "Calculus" for six months for about 61 dollars.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded without cost today, while scientists and engineering scientists can be very poor.
Look at every case.
Joe Gault, 29, who is first visited the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN price number for books, since you can be so sure to find the correct teaching book.
And before a online order, you should check, so gault, whether the book is actually proper.
This lecture he learned at the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in college books.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" wasn't a boxer
"The Expendiables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million Budgets in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" just played 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" on Cameron Diaz played only 14,6 million dollars at the weekend opening, while children films such as "Drakens made easy 2" also disappeared at the income.
An article of the Telegraph Film Critical Robbie Collin indicates that when children's missing films, the films can be the reason to be.
Collin named 2014 as "the worseest year" before for children films and described "Draquem smokes made easy 2 as pure "functional" Fantasy-translation.
However, in movies for some older target group, it seems like if the quality of the film is not independently the problem.
In July compared Entertainment Weekly, the average CinemaScore and Metacritic assessment for each solar film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at the launching year at at least 2000 lenways.
The results are supported on the opinion of Kinobiscuits and film critics and indicates that this year movies are equal to those of the past year.
Some commenters believe that the development of the changed seasons and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisher Jon Favreau, who is currently working at Disneys' showing a Dschungelbook film, said on the Hollywood Reporter website: "I believe the time is changed."
We need to accept it and not try to follow the past.
In accordance with the low challenges results of Hollywood products, Netflix has recently obtained resources with the streaming content of 1,2 billion dollars, almost duplicates as much as in the last year in which $837 million.
In the last room, the Register Steven Spielberg criticized the film studies that they concentrated too much on the films of comics and prophecy a "Kern Smelze" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current disaster, some comments argued that his darkest prophecy can contain a true nucleus.
According to the potential boxers expecting in 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World are other representatives of the film industry:
The producer of X-Man, Simon Kinberg, described the back of the box results recently as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood Reporter, "The next room will be the biggest summer at the kinocase, and no one will worry about the business."

Nato-Gipfel: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there was protests of the Nato-Gipfels in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds were gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti-Nato-March.

Scaling Government Federal Protests in Pakistan
The demonstrators were departed by soldiers from the PTV Officer Pervaiz Rashid.
The sender took the explosion again after a half hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrants had been destroyed in the editor.
Dead or dead was not reported.
The Demonstrators require the return of the Government Board, which they are proposed for a choice.
The police shared around a kilometer from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come back to meeting around 3000 demonstrators with security forces on the month.
After hospital officers, a policeman was lost.
At the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were hurt than the demonstrants tried to prevent Sharif's residence.
They request the return of the President of the Ministry.
The powerful military had called a political solution of the conflict on the Sunday age after a meeting in Army's headquarters, "no time to disappear and use without violence."
It further said: "The army remains obligated to ensure the security of the State."
The scalating violence has been worried about an income of the soldier who has already been raised in the past.
The protests adopted by the opposition policy Iran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri since the independence day on 14 August.
Sharif has a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called their additives to keep out on Sunday.
"We're not going back without Sharif to return," said Khan.
Qadri looked like it.
Khan suggests Sharif to win the Parliament's election in May last year.
Qadri requests the return of the Central and Province Governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the selection system and call new choices.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect government quarters.

The saison offer after the second saison row on the place three of the table.
With the 2:0 of the Great Rapid took a regular end for Rapid a worse week on Sunday.
"The vig is very free," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the outcome in Europe League on Sunday had been an interim.
"The successful life was increasingly important," confirmed Captain and Tower Protection Staff Hofmann, who had been proposed with green white in place three.
Dramme traumator brings Rapid to the Sieger Street Rapid with the second saison seed shows the correct reaction on the declination against Helsinki and goes with a successful life in the country game path.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Thomas Schramel, a foreign protective Thomas Schramel, who, with his majesty leadership volley from the six-screen recycle in 14 minutes, put the wheels on the road.
"I thought I was cut off the entire fresh from the Sunday and cut it down under the latte," the 26-year-old lie.
It was still for Ried, as a stress on 13 November 2010 at the last time in a contractsliga party.
The First Mastership Officer in Rapid Dress will therefore stay in special reminder.
"For me it's something very special, I'm right out of the rapid seat," said Schramme.
Since Mario Pavelic's short-term Becken-Blessur smoke from the left on the right defense side, he also made his thing very well.
He has enough experience that he can also spread this position.
The gate has rewarded, he has already made a few assistents," he loved Barisic.
Management shows Charakter Schramme also delivered the floor to 2:0 by the Hofmann after an hour, which finally took the decision.
Because before, the guests could also be able to write.
"God thanks for God, we have had something happy today," also observed the crack that played on the exchange of exposure and results in the past week: "The results have not sounded, but the playery was always good in comparison to the last year."
Barisic even found that you were "in many games better than today" - against "the strongest humanity that played in this stadium."
The first three points since 26 July, therefore, have proved that the manner's attachment has been inacted to the back-up: "Today my husband has shown that she has characterized."
Not less happy for him, "What we finally played to zero."
A lot of work during the country game breaks even the circumstances that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimelsberger have been achieved for several accidents, and Mrdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philip Schobesberger have given their startup debts, make the wind more valuable.
"Man can't forget that," murdered Barisic, who lost in the past three days with respect and Pavelic player, "who were very stabil in the last time."
The country's game break should therefore be used to be used to lie and to make a little bit in the body area, Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his line.
One whose break is especially attached is Captain Hofmann.
He's disappointed for the manner, he's about pains over there.
Even in this hard phase he showed that he is a very important player for us," constated Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68 minutes. Not only the structure, but also obtained the second gate.
For the 33-year-old, who solved his 350-year-old game, it was the first tracker out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that it's all right now" "We're sure we have a little happy, but sometimes the luck has to come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He said freely to concentrate further work: "Man can't always see it black and white.
We didn't play so bad in the last week as it was shown.
But we can't believe that it's all right now.
He couldn't address his role for the team.
It's a very young manner that I can help at the moment.
But they keep in some phases to me," said Hofmann.
Great coach, Michael Baur had to imagine a little bit of his husband.
He respected the quick accommodation " out of the category Zaubertor", and the regular door of use in the 40.minute, which was obvious by the Swahi Richter's colleagues to unrighteously.
The only proposal I can make the manner is that we weren't absolutely enough to drive the door in some phases.

Under this vipfel, the rest of peace
A powerful trimeon we showed in the last freetage of the Sommer Serie "My piece of Rhener Happy".
Many of these trees are still in the ground cross, the imaged exemplary is the "bever-roaches" below under white bruns.
A holiday foot path leads up to the age of about 600 years old.
It's finished in groups, basaltstein houses and basaltstein seas.
A piece below the rockbrook from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the street to Weisbach, where it is.
Vital seems to be the natural deceit, it goes out over the other trees of the environment and remembers a range of over eight meters in an American mammuth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree steel indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, intensive research was only indicated to the name's coming.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and asked older people from under-white branches to learn what kind of changes it has with the branch.
The result of his investigations remained the right severe statement for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the fishermen should have taken their animals from underwhile branches and have been released from stones.
At the foot of the building, the animal shepherds have been cut off from the top.
In the middle of the area has reached his significance, because they actually reach back to the shows.
The area is also declared to the nuclear area of the biosphere reserve, and Sneider has further discovered.
However, in the case of stone collections, you should be careful, because the basalt of the sun is also a favorite place for cross-shirts.
A wander path leads from underwhite branches to the tree, but something hidden.
Other ways are shown to upstairs the direction of the highway and to invite an excited smoking.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is looking for our next task is to find more slightly in the height.
The speed in the grave is already a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the ground, which can apply the building conterfei.

Putin requested by Kiew to take the "State Talk" with the Eastukraine
The Russian President Wladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on the Sunday that the Ukrainian Government set the battle against the separators in the east of the country and directly with negotiations to the "state" of the absent region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskov later explained that Putin had not agreed that it would be a part of Russia, but that it should be redefined against Ukraine, to give the Russian language region the power to maintain its rights and interests.
But the Putins calls to the Kiewer Government to negotiate at the higher level with the pro-Russic rebels, however, the strategie that seemed to be followed from him since five months ago: assistance to the separators when entering areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow the new pronounced region Novorossi fatal independence for a alliancy with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Television Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukraine military campaign to recover the areas held by Separatists in the east regions Donezk and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April after Moscow adopted the Ukrainian Halbinsel Krim on 18 March.
The Circle and the Separatists have recently mentioned the income area as "Novorossia" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds the pre-revolutionary glance time of the Russian imperium.
Putin therefore pointed out that all those who are in the rooms of the Ukraine Politics for the elections on 26 October and during the government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separatists are expected to "they are held in their illusions" reported Itar Tass.
"We need to take outward discussions, not only to technical issues, but also to the political organization of the society and the state of the Southern ukraine, to maintain the interests of people who live there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the nationality in the context with the larger autonomy, which has been discussed since months from the guidance, to exceed fears in Russian language areas that their cultural and speaking rights are dangerous.
Only the Ukraine Government can share the needed autonomy in the east areas, said Peskov.
There is no discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "It's not for a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but for an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Criml speaker on the correction of the "fail interpretation" of Putin's comments underlines Russ' leadership in the east with the separate rebellion in the east, in accordance with the direct annex of the Crime, on which most of the 2 million ethnic Russian residents are.
Moscow had greater difficulties to recognize the regions Donezk and Luhansk in the East York, since most of the 6,5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and there were a wide majority for the remaining in Ukraine before the conflict.
The autonomy, which was spoken by Russian diplomates on international Forces, would give the regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and to Krim de facto give the control on a area connected to the Russian State area with the Crime.
The half-binsel in the Black Sea is the household for the largest part of the Russian sea, as well as an important trade field and historical cost region.
The regions between the Rostow Area in Russia and the Crime are also rich in Mines, Fabrics and Gardens, which produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, on 7 June, proposed that the Ukrainian legislation should consider additions to the reconciliation, with which the areas will be considered a greater control on their financials and the status of languages.
But his imagination of autonomy seems seriously compared to those of the crowl and the separate rebels, which are proposed by the weapons and the raising of Moscow.
Putin's last requirement in Kiew to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at the eighth, followed another prevention of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and panzers were entered on the previous peaceful region from the Asian Sea to the East York.
The Separatists supported by Russia were taken into the tradestroom, the fear of the Ukraine Security Officer of the first step of a campaign to carry out the strategic cost region to the Crime, the control of Newoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civic and military preparations are prepared for Mariupol to seek a staff industry with 500,000 residents, which is between Newoasowsk and the low access to half-chrim.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently requested acts to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a previous Swedish Republic, which has been undependent since 23 years.
"We stay shortly before a point where there is no back again," warned poroshenko.
Thousands of other forces and hundreds of strangers are now in the Ukraine Territory.
The EU Guide decided no specific actions that lead required the design of more sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an unspecified scale of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to return from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian Panzer Colonels and 1000 soldiers entered in the Donezk region last week to support the ransom separatists, said the Supreme Andri Lysenko, the speaker of the Ukraine National Security and Defence Council reports on the Sabbath day in Kiew.
The first likely 63 Ukraine soldiers concluded by the Russian incident in Ilowajsk were raised up on Sunday against 10 Russian boxers who were held in prison on a week ago in the Ukrainian area.
Nacktfotoskanal for Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't make a heal about his crazy about Hacker, which probably rolled the images of his promised Gabi Grecko and one who is who shot the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film town is recorded after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking channel on Promis on the Internet.
The responsible hacker has about 60 Nacket photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and of Superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the songs Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the skins of Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian Viewers Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also offered private photos because of a iCloud-Lucks published.
On the list, 101 Promis.
The oldest one who had sworn with Grecko the last month said to Confidential, "It's contrary."
All private letters and images should be private.
It is a threat that private information can be locked and delivered to others.
Grecko, during the time in New York, reports were reported after a message website that the hack was "fastly" and that the interested "shot" felt.
The hacker probably had 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two records in which they are up without a pool.
The film workers "Love is invisible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the shoes browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments to the hacked images.
A representative Lawrence said to the TMZ, "It's an absolute loss of the privacy."
Viewer Seth Rogen judged the hacker in his tweet: "Shacked images from a phone is nothing different than the sale of Hehlerware."
Clearly seen should not be tolerated by the further broadcast images.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were yesterday at 8 radels on the large fieldberg, and so they supported the "Help for Club Health Childs".
The tour for which one tour was made for others a lot of training.
However, in one were all ones: it's been happy.
Thomas Studanski had to sleep well last night.
For the first time in his life, the captain of the officer Brauhouse was gone yesterday with the Council on the fieldberg.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle boxer can easily remove it, as well as his participation on 8 radels on the large fieldberg, the most beneficiary of the United Nations 'Help for Club Health Children' (Frankfurt) has also brought a valuable recognition.
Great thing.
"I now know that I can - good!"
Small shoes walking in the applaus curve?
No, if I had stopped, it would be...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the capital city parliament, many of the 718 participants came yesterday in the floor at the mountain and came near the creation, but happy on the platform.
Others had been easier to overcome the good 11 kilometers of long streets between Highmark and Feldberg.
Norman Dietzner, for example.
The whole green policy from the cross - red dress, rose - made something on the beginning of the substitution ("All many professions, there is the target!"), but then, in the mountain, it was a half-profit and went after 45 minutes without an attempt.
He also traveled the streets in a Russian road, such as Nina Kuhn, Press Presseller of the city Oberursel, who had made his way together with Frank Green.
For the two triathletters, the "Feldberg-radeln" was not unconditionally a sport requirement: "This is about Charity, where we are pleased with it - a experience we would have done today without anywhere," so kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel out of the top-rivenberg.
The boy (12) went down to the surface on the morning to fix it again to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Birz was thrown up at 9:00 to the satellite at the morning, "maked" the fieldberg twice to round with happiness to the house.
It was also a "free-toni".
For the captain of the Governor Kultkiosks, the radtors are easy to do about the fieldberg.
He was playing with his 6,5-kilo-rad 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I like to be there," Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says that he's a "ambitional ren radiator".
That's what he should be, because he was walking with the "Fixy-Constant", they're also ringing, but without smoking...
That is not only the 20 wanderers who went up on the white wall and the fuchstance to the tomb, but also a young man who went on a cordle, with the weights.
Professor Volker Lischke, who, with his team, worried for security with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trained for a special slitter trail, just that he keeps the locks himself." The man is so certain of his own slide.
The 718 participants - and so many as never - were sent in groups on the streets on the morning.
The wanderers first at 9:30.
They followed the first travelers and louders at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bickers left.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Treaty "Radels on the Great fieldberg", gave the startcommandos and wanted the participants a beautiful flight.
For the next year, he hopes that it is able to lock the streets up to the fieldberg to the safety of the participants.
