Debates about 50+1 rules
The previous DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended to consider the discharge of 50+1 rules.
"The German football should at least discuss, set up conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU commission has completed facts," said Grindel of the "image on Sunday".
He said: "For the agreements that can be dangerous in the first Bayers and Dortmunds, 50+1 rules do not work without any means: see Leipzig or Levercues.
In fact, it does not come to the debate if it is not ordained to interfere in this phalanx to facilitate the relationship of investors."
However, he doubted whether it was prepared in the German football Liga to allow majority participations under the contract by the 50+1 rules.
"It remains a juristic risk, in a European internal market investment plan, to take the Buddensliga's economic location," said Grendel.

So the differences are only among the first three agreements.
The other 15 United States have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.

"Laughingly, it has given people who have noticed this mistake and have passed up to the prices instead of me to talk about it," said Grindel about the acceptance of a tire hour that led to his return in April 2019.
"This has already been working for me."
The gift in the value of about 11,000 euros had received from a Ukraine functioner.
"I have been a complaint, and it was right to get the consequences," said Grindel.
"I have been totally transparent and gorgeous with the intimate horse.
It's already known many in the DFB."
He never made a "heal out of the gift," the 58-year-old.
"This can be called naiv, although this form of transparency was the total part of corruption."
