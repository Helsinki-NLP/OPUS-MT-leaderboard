Viewer is running in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportman Jonathan Florez saved Jeudi from a helicopter over Bogota, Colombia capital.
A wingsuit equipped (un combination of woods), it passed up to 160 km/h above the Monserrate holiday, located over 3000 meters of height, where many bathrooms were gathered to observe his exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While the United States ' s routine network planners have bad money to find the necessary money to repair the authorised infrastructure in decrepited, many are those who provide a solution in form of a small black box that is fixed above the border of your car.
The devices, which register all thousands of passengers through a car and transmit information to the officials, are in the center of a controversy trial in Washington and in the government offices of the planning to remain the obsolete financing system of the main American routes.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of great axis has suddenly proceeded a strong anonymous debate and moved allocations.
Freedoms have joined ecologist groups to pressure to the government use the small boxes to keep the trace of thousands you walk, and eventually the way you run, and then use the information to edit a fiscal law project.
The Tea Party's down.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expressed its concern on the protection of private life.
And while the members of the Congress do not have agreed to know if it is necessary to continue, many States have not waited.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they can pass to a system that allows the drivers to pay according to the number of thousands of parkers.
Millions of automobiles have already built these black boxes, sometimes equipped from a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental virus.
This is really indispensable for our nation.
“It's not as if we had the choice,” said Hasan Yhrata, Director General of Southern California Association of Governments, which proposes that the State begins to record thousands of walking through every California cars from 2025.
There will be changed in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans have in the pompe, is financially in section.
The Americans don't get so precious than before.
Cars can travel more than thousands with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18,4 cent per gallon, has not increased 20 years ago.
Political men are restricted to increase the tax, even one hundred, while the prices of the essence are higher.
“The rate on the essence is not simplely able,” said Lee Munnich, a specialist of transport policies to the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a miles payment system.
"This is the most logical alternative at long term," he said.
Wonks calls this to use price for kilometers.
It is not surprised that the idea seduces the liberal liabilities, for the taxes could be used to modify conduct habits in order to reduce gas reliefs and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system because they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set in the ambitional laws of the State on climate recovery.
But the representative of Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), President of the Committee on Transports of the Representatives, stated that he also considered it as the most widely long-term alternative.
Reason's free market participants also appreciate the idea of paying the drivers a thousand.
"It's not just a tax in a big black steel," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Political Policy to Reason Foundation.
People are directly paid for the benefits they are looking for.
The movement is also supported by two ancient American secretariats to Transports, which, in a report of 2011, requested the Congress to go in the way of payment for miles.
The American Senat approved a pilot project of 90 M$ in the last year that would have carried about about 10 000 cars.
However, the Chamber's President killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of the rural legislators who represent electors who must pass through a number of thousands of days every day for their work or city.
Many States and large cities, however, have progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilised 5000 drivers to bring the most important experience in the country.
These carriers are immediately paid to the State of kilometer prices instead of rates on the essence.
Nevada has already sent a pilot project.
The city of New York is invisible for one.
Illinois tries a test on a lot of travels.
And I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in the road transport in states along the Coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how it could have been implemented.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars recently equipped their car from a device, the drivers were worried that the government could follow their detailed and management.
“The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of things are a big problem, ” says Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic management of the performance department of Nevada Transports.
It's not something that people want.
After the beginning of the test, Nevada ACLU warned on his site: “This would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire location devices.”
It is not necessary to build a large and combined technological infrastructure that will be inevitably widely to maintain allies records and entirely arrived.
Nevada is part of some states that are then going to find a nice technology that would allow the State to know how many thousands of car park a car, but without knowing the location or the exact time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more in the air.
The research of this technology has brought some state agencies to call to a small startup of California, the name of True Mileage.
In the original, the company was not destined to help carriers who pay taxes to States.
She was trying to persist in the market of the car insurance, in which the drivers would pay by their kilometers.
But the devices that she tests have more to the planners of great axis because they don't use the GPS and provide a limited quantity of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"The people will be more courageous to do that if you don't record their speed and don't find them," says Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Great errors have been made in the pilot programmes of certain States.
There are very less worthy methods and methods that are very less intrusible to process.
In Oregon, the planners try experience by offering different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose to not have a device of all things, prefering to pay a forfait based on the average number of thousands of travellers by all residents of the State.
Other States hoped to sell the concept to malfish citizens, allowing devices to do more than enough.
In the city of New York, transport responsibilities are trying to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay the staff costs, to provide a “page to conduct” ensure and to create a total data on the real speed in the event of other drivers that automobilists could use to disappear equipment.
“Automobiles would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers to them,” indicated a document on the town management.
However, some transport planners are asked if all the debates on the payment of a miles are not just a great diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of San Francisco bath area, the responsibility says that the Congress could be very simple to control the failure of the Highway Trust Fund by increased rates on the essence.
A additional or annual tax may be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on other vehicles which vehicles do not use a lot of essential, so everybody pays his right part.
"It is not necessary to run a racial surgery when we just need aspirine," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs to the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of automobilists will be concerned about the protection of their private life and one of other things.
David Bowie: Four inhedits listen
The English music hasn't finished this year.
From The Next Day, in January, he concoated a reed of luxury for the 4 November, with several inevitations.
Four have already buried on the Toile.
The announcement of a new album of David Bowie had left all the pantois.
The day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would go out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disk, Reality, date of 2003) and too weird apparatus in public, the English musician proved that we could still count on him to make the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not the surprises, David Bowie had more tour in his sack with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke so proposed to reedit this album on 4 November.
For the opportunity, he concocked a real party for his fans.
This review, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented under the form of three disks: the original album, ineditized studio sessions and reviews, and a DVD containing the four cuts already deleted.
The Next Day Extra will contain ten additional titles in relation to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe editing, five special songs specially devoted for the occasion and two remixs.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful cover in a video.
It entered each one of the disks, but also the accessors provided with: photos and exclusive pockets, a book to share their own impressions, a book with words...
And, in particular, he gives a pre-good of his new atomic title, typically in The Next Day's vine, with guitars very forward and a rock electricity safeguarded.
Instructions are already listed
But Atomic isn't the only title to devote his charms.
The reporter, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO, they are also available on the top.
The reporter is a double-face: a careful income before a light chariot that rains progressively to leave a pop balled.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even to Gravity?
With this rejoiced title, the song seems in all cases in his element when he has no more foot on earth.
Space Oddity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his stranger: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, sending, gives them to leave the Earth.
Bowie's in all cases to play the cameon with these tits: tour to the computer, man on the ground of a fuse, the potential marginal...
He disciplines and reveals once, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did all through his carrier, especially with his Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing amazing that he has a mask on his hand in the photography of the campaign The Invitation to Voyage, mark of Louis Vuitton, whose new face is incarcerated.
He will appear in one of their public spots from 10 November.
The Ministry of the Defence, Rob Nicholson, intended to say that the violated soldiers were not fully released from the Canadian Army Forces, and submitted that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civil life.
With the liberals and neo-demokrates at the community room, Mr. Nicholson ensures that before their liberation, the army members followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All the wounded soldiers receive the appropriate attention to their return to civil life and no one of them has been released before they were ready.
Detractors accused the Government to want to economic money without allowing the violated soldiers - which do not respond to the rule of "the university of the service" of the army required that the personnel may be in force to carry out a series of different tasks - to achieve the admissibility period of 10 years required for retrait payments.
They also citated two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including a soldier released last Friday.
Captain David Hawkins, a reserver of London, in Ontario, from the syndrome of post-traumatic stress, was released from the army while he requested to stay a year more, so that he could receive a full indexed retreat.
His case was occurred after the Captain Glen Kirkland, who declared before a Parliamentary committee, last month, that he had been carried out before he was ready because he did not respond to the universal rule of the service.
Mr. Hawkins submitted that a soldier could be prepared to leave with plans and consultation sessions, but that was absolutely different than the fact that he wanted to leave the rangs.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with the Canadian Press.
I asked for months if there was a way to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major wars in Afghanistan, the army is painful to determine what length it can give to the wounded soldiers who want to stay in the rangs, but they are not attached to war.
According to the current rules, greenly violated soldiers have been three years to be restored.
If they do not respond to the criteria for foreign deployments, they can be forced to leave the army.
The data present in the last year to the Parliament indicates that among 1218 soldiers freed for medical reasons, 199 did not get the required service duration for retraiting.
The liberal port-word of old fighters, Jim Karygiannis, asked the reintegration of the Hawkins caporal, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called the immediate end of "the hot practice".
Disney set on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and Disney divergence group decided to privilege the tablets to their own television chains for the next sort of a new series for children.
The nine first episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the Watchdisneyjunior.com or through its application for phones and tablets.
His global launch on the chains of the Disney group only was provided in 2014, detailed by its Division Disney Junior.
The anonymous design, destined to the children of 2 to 7 years, tells the chat Callie chat, sheriff of a town of West America where she rules the order with a magic laser.
Each episode includes two historys of 11 minutes.
"Interrating with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice-President carried out digital products in Disney/ABC Television Group, cited in the communication.
This type of experience is in the framework of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are more important," added.
A week-end published by Common Sense Media shows a explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of less than 2 years have already been served by a tablet or phone, and 72% of less than 8 years, respectively 10% and 38% before two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the American Information Service Denunciator, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and his Director Keith Alexander had no answers on their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbelle met Jeudi Mr Snowden in Russia, where he benefits of the assile right to discuss his witness in Germany.
In a letter that the deputy had submitted to the media in Berlin Vendredi, Mr Snowden said: “Which the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of thinking as a fugitive and try to penalize the political talk with accusations against which it is impossible to defense.”
However, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persecute the United States government to lose the criminal charges held against him.
In the framework of the statement referred to by the American Ministry of Justice, it is accused of spioneing and flying of goods of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of German Interior, stated online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German responsibilities, we will make this possible.”
The relationships between the United States and Germany have been tested on the following statements, as the NSA had listed on the portable phone of the German chance of Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opermann, who leads to the parliamentary group overseer foreign secret services, stated that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden at the witness "not put it into danger and completely destroy the relationships with the United States," he had to benefit.
Mr. Ströbelle, Mr. Vert German, published a photo from him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
When he visited Russia, he was with two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbelle stated that, according to the ancient consultor of the NSA, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left the country.
If Mr. Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would have to give him the confidence that he would be in "security" there, he said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had made a "great and supported" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's reaction face to the "the act of political expression".
The citizens of the whole world and the high responsible, including the United States, have judged that the revelation of an unexpliable permanent monitoring system was a public use.
The letter provides an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “as the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved. ”
Cogeco Câble could immediately offer the interactive tele
Cogeco Câble subscriptions could well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and finally the video service on Netflix request through their TV in a future that seems not so far.
Cogeco's office indicated that she was currently carried out preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of her users.
"This will make us a value of more convivictive interfaces and more options," explained the President and captain of the direction of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Câble thus emphasizes the step to its competitors, such as Bell, even if the Cogeco office has not yet a specific date in that new platform.
"It must be adapted and changed or retained to change and failure," sublined Mr Audet.
The last goal remains to offer tools to which our customers are currently not accessible.
The Rogers telecommunications manager has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be discussed with some major distributors to be available through their diffusion platforms.
The P.-d.g. of Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government Harper during its talking of the Throne on 16 October last.
Ottawa wants to strengthen television providers by chamber and satellite to offer customers the possibility of paying services to the card.
"It's about two years and half that we say that the idea of strengthening consumers to buy significant chains, it does not work," said Mr Audet.
However, it hopes that the consultations referred to by the Council of radiodiffusion and the Canadian Telecommunications (CRTC) will take place on interesting recommendations.
"It should be a new framework for the definition of our new Canadian cultural policy in the television," says Cogeco.
The CRTC takes consultations to the public since the last week, and they should continue with the industry at the next time.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that a net benefit of 43,8 million at the fourth trimester, or 82 ­ by action.
It is compared to the net profit of 44,9 million, or 83 cc by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this recreation by costs of affairs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband carbon distributor in 2012, established in the United States for 1,36 billion.
It was the first biggest acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
In December last, the Montreal company also buyed Peer 1 Network Companies, a Internet provider established in Vancouver for the sum of 526 million.
With regard to Cogeco's income, they recognized a growth of 41.5% in the fourth trimester to achieve 504.7 million.
They are $1,8 billion for the current financial exercise.
The net benefit of its main office, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 cc per action, recursively in relation to 45.7 million, or 93 ­ per action, of the same period in the last year.
However, Cogeco Câble's income has progressed from 45% to achieve 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 clients during the fourth trimester.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is higher 5546.
Mr. Audet does not worry to see the number of fluctuar clients.
For me, it's not the indication of a trend change, he observed.
It's different from a trimester to another with a very living competition.
The horse in wood products
The horse meat has been deleted in boxs of bow-based products, sold by two small britannical distribution teachers at lower price, today announced the loaded food hygiene agent.
Routine tests declared that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained from 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"If the horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingrédients, it should not be presented in the product," explained the British Agency.
A challenge on the presence of horse meat in cooking platts spread in Europe at the beginning of the year after the tests made in Ireland.
According to the reviews of the European Commission, France was the most touched country in the presence of this type of meat in census products containing only bottles.
A collision between two vehicles made four wounds, early in the late 131 road, in Lanaudière.
Before 4 hours, a car running in the north direction, at Saint-Felix-de-Valois, lost the manager of his vehicle and destroyed a car that came in the other direction.
The four officers of the two vehicles were hurt, but they were not afraid for their life.
The circulation was returned to normal to 6:00, Friday.
Airlines Frontier provides to pay the handmaid bags
Frontier Airlines provides to pay to $100 to the passors who carry hand bags on their flights.
Frontier Airlines intended to pay up to $100 for a hand-base and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its mercredi announcement, she indicated that the pasters could bring the non-opened ship with them to the decent of the air.
The new manufacture costs concerned the sacks ranged in the above party, so the small sacks installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that she would pay $25 if the costs were paid forward and $100 if the travellers would pay only one time at the market door.
The Frontier door, Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 were proposed to incentive the travellers to pay the price forward.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Air companies started paying the first and second bags recorded in 2008.
Passovers who were trying to escape these costs were so much as they could in the hand-hand bags in the above parties, so there were often no more place in these shares.
These trains are a way to ensure that the travellers transport less than things to the top.
O'Malley said that these new costs wouldn't really serve to collect money.
It is to understand the most faithful Frontier clients that will be more difficult to find the place in the above parties.
The passors who buy their ball on the site of the air company won't be paid.
So a traveler who makes the hair to a Frontier border door could transport a free sack, while the next person in the cow could pay $100 for a similar sack.
O'Malley explained that the website and the Frontier registration procedures are intended to change in order to ensure that passors know the existence of these costs before they arrive to the door.
Frontier's bathroom costs will not be applied before the age, although no date was fixed.
Travellers often look for bags and other costs, but air companies love them.
They estimate that the costs of maintenance of bags are important and that passors who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street consist of adding bathroom costs as a sign that proves that aircraft companies make a lot of price to cover the airport cost after years of loss.
However, many of them did not touch bathroom prices.
Espirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first bathroom prices for three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company intended of such costs is the Hungarian Wizz Air company, stated the consultant to the Air Company Jay Sorensen, who follows the costs in addition.
He estimated, in a report of December 2011, that the staff costs of the Spirit’s hand were $50 per year.
Sorensen, an older frame of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on the Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the campaign door at the time the pasts would discover the inhabituous hand-basses imposed by the company.
“I have never seen an embarkment procedure so fluid of all my professional carriers,” said he.
I was expecting to see the decks and a bagary to cry out at the door.
The airport was full, he added, "The travelers are moved to the light speed."
Frontier also makes the Spirit and apply costs of $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that the passors who take a soda or a fruit juice can bring the non-open cancell with them, and those who take the coffee can be freely reserved.
She will always distribute free water.
The US Airways tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but it was returned after seven months later after the travellers were discovered and there was no other big airport company followed.
The decision of Frontier to pay hand-taking costs when passors do not directly buy their balance to the air company is its last effort to encourage customers to go on their site.
Airlines pay for online travel sales such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ballet sold.
This encouraged all air companies to encourage pasts to buy directly to them instead of addressing a online travel agent.
However, Frontier has gone far away in this area.
In September, she started offering only half thousands of faith to customers who buy their ballet through a online travel agency.
Mercredi, she reduced the prices of 25% on a travel.
So, a Frontier traveling of 10,000 miles buyed to a online travel agent would allow you to win 250 miles.
She also allows passors to choose their seat in the front, only if they buy their ballet directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a faithful client in her origin town, Denver, but her activities returns and she loses money.
The recipes have broken from 9% and their air capacity has reduced almost 13% during the first trimester, according to the financial results published by his mother's company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to reduce Frontier's finances by selling the air company.
The NSA causes a "internal error" and not information pirates for its website
The National Security Agency operating in the shadow stated that it was a bug that had caused the bug of his public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some had proposed it online.
“NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that has occurred during a warned upgrade,” indicated the Spionage Agency in an email declaration.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The allégations according to which the pan was caused to an attaque of distributed service deniment [DSD].
Before this evening, online trackers noted that the NSA site was in panne for at least 6 hours, and some users could not always be accessed to the site.
Moreover, a NSA port-word reported to ABC News that the internal network of the agency was not "no of all" compromise.
No classified information is in danger, he explained the port-word.
At least one online hacktivist group stated that it was responsible for the NSA website by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks have been cut down a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site is broken.
The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not destined to penetrate in the internal network of the monitored system.
The NSA later secretly, a time named "No such Agency" was found under the fire of projectors and strongly criticized during the past months after its large monitoring programmes of communications at national and foreign level, which are part of the secret files of the NSA carried out to the Agency and developed by the ancient consultant of NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the Agency has provoked many specifications according to which the event of this night was the result of a target cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The hotel Delta Centre-Ville closed his Jewish doors in Montreal after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that had the building has sold it to promotors who will transform it in student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked in the hotel.
Two hundreds of them have not yet found new employment.
Delta promised not to stop his employees.
Workers have come to meet employees directly, and individually have met the employees to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of the Working Relations of the Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closement of Delta is involved in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of that building had a choice to do.
As he re-invested in the building to continue to operate it, so there were ten million investments while competition was very fair, there were many new hotels appeared in Montreal.
Paul Arsenault, tituler of the Tourist Chair Transited to the UQAM Science Sciences.
Other Montreal Hotels will also be converted in the next months, such as Crown Plaza, who will be a residence for older people.
At least, four hotel projects totalising about 600 rooms will see the day of here two years.
For the Titan PDG, "The Goodyear's Buy project starts with zero employed"
After getting the episode with failures in January for the party recovery of the Goodyear of Amens-Nord website promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American pneumatician Titan, has been declared today, ready to save 333 jobs on 137 accounting of the use.
Arnaud Monteburg, Minister of Product Research, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After renewing the consumption project in January, you're coming today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insultes, speaking about "soi-distant workers", which "work three hours" per day, syndicates "faus", regarding the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-face.
Is it to please Mr. Monteburg?
I'm not trying to make anyone happy.
Except my wife.
Mr. Monteburg, a young man who trys to save industrial employments among the best payments.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has also a high level of imposition and comfort.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours per day when other countries work eight hours in France.
In India, China and in full other countries, we work 10-12 hours per day.
But I don't have prejudices on France.
What I see is a use that produces good agricultural pneus, having good equipment, is well located and has spaces to increase.
Why did Titan need this use so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this use.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, this is the reason to try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the statement of the cluster of the use, Goodyear had offered good department, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed use in Goodyear.
Thus, Titan could lead machines to Poland or any other European Union countries who still have their own money.
I think Mr. Monteburg knows that.
But he wants to keep the use of Amens with at least 333 good jobs.
Titan accepts them to recruit between some 1 200 current guests of Goodyear.
So Mr. Monteburg needed Titan's commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear make a agreement on all employees.
Then there will be no more employees in the use.
Mr. Monteburg said you were ready to ensure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he wants a four-year guarantee.
But as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on departments.
If all salaries accept them, the consumption project starts with zero employed.
How can we give long employment guarantees when there is no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg agrees that CGT and Goodyear are agreed and that Titan takes the use, we have the intention to stay in Northern Amiens more than four years.
The benefit of Bombardier is low, while the deliverys and airlines are returned
Bombardier Inc, Canadian Airport and Ferroviary Builder, reported a 15% of his net judian benefits, under pressure of low-down commands and airports during the third trimestre and contractual problems in his division Trains.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no longer provided test data for its new airport CSeries or information that allows you to know whether the aircraft will respect its ambitious commercial service calendar before the next September.
After the inaugural pilot of the trial air, about a month and half ago, this last was only three times, and the question was then raised to know whether the test phase was in a good way.
The results were not at the height of the previsions and the course of actions returned from 8% to Toronto's Bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, an analysis in the National Financial Bank, has exceeded its notation, passed by “overfarmation” to the “sector performance” due to the low potential of bullshits during the next trimestrial or two nearly trimesters.
“ Although the bottom of aviation delivery was in a large part of an anticipated party, we are really deceived by the beneficiary margin in the Transport division,” said Cameron Doerksen in a note to the customers.
We think that Bombardier will record new commands for its CSeries airports and measures that the trial program will progress.
However, if no new command has been announced during the next month, we are expected that the market becomes more sceptic about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family can capture it in the bottom segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first trial airport was released in March and was first in September after months later.
But the number of locked commands for the CSeries aircraft is modest until 177. It seems that potential buyers wait for the results of the trial tests in order to validate the energy efficiency and the potential of the new line economys.
In the present time, the company recorded a total of 403 commands and contracts to acquire at 15 customers and operators.
Peter Beaudoin, President and chief of the direction, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its objective of 300 commands closed before the first aircraft service.

Five years ago, my father was deleted from the world of lives.
In the beginning, I've been dead, and I've talked about him at this time,
I was so afraid of forgetting it, or soon I didn't know how I was going to keep the "frequent".
There is no recette, of employment mode to pass the wall of the invisible wall and find its.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong resident of his presence on the past seat when I was leaving.
Another time, a dark wake up full night to look at his show that doesn't leave me anymore, put on the night table.
It's the image of my suffering father who's coming with me in my age everyday.
Our mother left us after his battle, disappearing against the cancer.
It's at least what I thought on the day I found his body empty, cried on this hospital bed with fresh draps.
Likewise, its funerals were a glass-focated steel around the light shirt of the chandells who carried out his circle.
I thought she was gone.
At least, by small day or night apparatus, a little timide, a little cut off, she was quickly returned to my mind, developing the hair and measured her place in the landing of my thoughts who believed in the loyalty.
And then she appeared to me when she devoted my own faces that I hadn't yet understood, massed by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person, but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated this person during her lives in life.
When she died, she had completed her life and delivered the person I loved, and here I found her, full and entire.
This way from my life is the most unexpected and the best.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as outside."
We've always told me.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relations with him until he becomes old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
In a long time, he was with me: when I stopped fucking, when I was afraid, when I was bad...
He talked to me, he encouraged me constantly, he lived my body.
I saw her hands looking at my hands, I gave her my body.
But it wasn't incredible.
I could have a personal life.
He left me intimidity.
It's a long time and a day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and weird to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know any more who said that the dead persons are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are not anymore but I feel them constantly near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always say it: What would they say? what would they think? what would they do?
I dream constantly from them, maybe not all nights but many times a week is sure.
I dream often the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always one thing I can't do this moment.
I wake up often angry when it happens to me, and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams bring me to the contrary and inspire in my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The safe of my echography where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was wake up, I stood out of the bed, my father waited for me on the ball, and he dreamed me and was glad I was waiting for a little boy.
On the next day, I felt that he visited me in my dream to mean that he shared with joy what happened to me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my wind.
I loved to share this moment with him and I'm happy to tell this common memory living after his death.
It's exactly five years ago, my grandmother would die after a cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
It's the choc that his disaster has provoked in the young bachelier that I was at the time.
I almost made my dear enough quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, particularly in the moments I'm in difficulty, or even when I have to take important decisions.
Learning the Arabic and interesting in the Middle East, in order to make a master in a large school, they have not been, with the reculation, anonymous choices.
In fact, I heard it often speaking Arabic in my childhood, and talking about Maroc, where she lived for decades - before she reached France at the time of independence.
The values she's inclined to me are still present, although I can think of how she would like to do at a given time.
It's also for my views: I'm trying to be at the height of the generousness and the right of the spirit that was a believer.
Then I feel it as a day presence, a welcome soul, a salvatory spirit.
I see his eyes sit on me.
My mother is deceived for 10 years ago.
Death after he spoke to me to the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, wrath, pain, weeping, weeping solemn, whereever, in insolent places, incongrus moments.
Then, the time enjoyed the pain.
Only the missing, this empty without answer, the need of her, to trust me, to save me to the cross of her dust.
But she's there, quiet presence, she's there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his eyes worried up on me, I see the shirts that turn their eyes, the lips around the lips that smoke the cygarettes, the lips that march the front of the worst days.
My mother took her from my face, and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I'll turn the eyes off.
My wife and mother of my three children are decisived from a cancer at 43 years.
We sent his protection permanently, nothing of serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, then we had little to sleep, and to preach his name is not more tabu, but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to him in the night's shirt when the absence makes too bad, she invites me in my dreams when the moral is a little getting.
We feel ported and protected in the difficult moments, the time's recreation made us to realize how she was the chief of orchester, and we're trying to stay in the way she had trained us.
If a person loved you very strong, the absence can not take you from the heart and memory.
In some way, loving being becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from the seats of a friend's cancer.
I was very close to him, I always did as he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't visit her inhumary and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from her, I always ask if my actions are agreed with his view of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go into a contrary sense, I don't sleep, and I always ask what he's going to think.
I don't know if I adopted his way to be or if I'm just like him, is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a bit like a other-game, he didn't need to talk to us.
Bref, he's here every day.
I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.
That's about 30 years that my husband was deceived in 33 years.
I was 28 and our son six years old.
The great pain that then envahied me was sure he was attained, but he's still near me.
Often he's "debark" in my dreams so precisely, as living than at the wave I'm still more sad to constat that it was just a dream.
On the other night, he asked me if I was well, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with a very real voice that I'm awakened up, anguished, and I held the hair lamp in looking at everywhere, as he was going to happen.
I've always lived in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I'm going back to see if he's not here, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all rooms I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I wouldn't leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lived with me.
I've been 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he's gone, and he's gonna stay my life's love.
I have to figure out that I am partner with a responsibility, I rise and I sing, I can go, I'm grandma, I'm full of friends, but my heart and my soul are with him, and I'm never talking outside him with my son, and I'm never going to the cemetery.

The cocainanoman lawyer who reported a copy of a police investigation was undertaken
Basharat Dieta, 42 years old, gave information to Neil Scarbrough crime
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addition to drugs would not be opened on the big day
It was condemned to a threatenation of three years by the Court of Liverpool Assembly
A great lawyer of the defence, who had informed an advocate of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addition to the drug was not revealed, was condemned at three years of prison.
Basharat Dieta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to Mr Neil Scarbrough crime on research on drug trafficking after being committed by its use of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was named "bash" and considered criminals as a "first important folder", was arrested in his house in 2011 after police audit operations directed to Scarborough, who had represented in a previous process in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers repeated Sarborough, 32 years old, trying to leave three cocaine sacks to the lawyer at Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he attended a Barreau's dinner with conflicts.
Researchs declared that Ditta was a “regular consumer ” of this class A after tests showed cocaine traces in her heads, on his portfolio and his credit cards.
On a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain an illegal way of obtaining information about two men to the Scarborough account and one of his partners.
The four suspects were observed at the time by the police in the framework of an important investigation on heroin and cocaïne trafic departed in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were then undertaken after the police was carried out from heroin and cocaine for amount of 1,5 M £, and more than 200 000 £ in a series of raids.
Diita, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because he feared that his toxicmany would not be discovered on the big day.
Today, at Liverpool Assembly Court, Dieta, who works in the office of Forbes Solicitors located in Blackburn, has fallen in disgrace after it was recognized on two officers of accusation of justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had adopted cocaine in the previous audience.
The challenge of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he was regularly in telephone contact with Dieta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and repeated it to Diita's house and placed from drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's pools in a black golf galt.
A little while after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Dieta, who was at a dinner at Ewood Park foot stage, a neighborhough club of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer has returned to him, has discovered the drug, and they have been phoned for nine times.
The Court heard that Dita was a “regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A in his heads, on his portfolio and his credit cards.
Itta was stopped later, but he had nine cocaïne. He said that he had spoken to the drug trafficker, because it was his client, and thus valued that their discussions were subjected to a "jury privilege".
While he was arrested, Dieta cut out his portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all inserted and prevented him a ring of hair.
In a question, he said that he had a office in his home, even at his workplace, and that he came to call the customers to him for legal issues.
But the Court heard witnesses that he called major factors in the trade of drugs, including some who had represented, after key arrests to tell them what researchers were currently.
Professor Anne Whyte said: "If someone needs to know that he doesn't have to violate the law, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta is accused that he had abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and that he was too involved with special customers.
The relationship we speak is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker from drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will be doubtless of legal communications because it was his lawyer.
But this was well far from the regular limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He entered the police investigation as soon as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Dita did not honor his profession, but he devoted it.
He's too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he left his independence.
He said all illegal actions and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have expected 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the audience, Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Dieta has passed from criminal lawyer himself since he started to seek drugs to criminal organizations.”
His addition to the cocaïne has ever committed it and has made it vulnerable to the members of the organizated criminal groups who have loaded it to obtain precious information on police investigations.
The lawyers should observe the most strict integrity rules and establish a confidential climate at the public.
Mr. Dieta trained this confidence and tried to explore after his profession.
The grave and organized criminality unit of Lancashira has submitted the investigation on Mr. Dieta, which has been recognized by the three captains of cocaïne accusation, and now in the case of justice, testifying his commitment to continue criminals in justice.
That case serves a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you to the courts.
Scarborough himself has been undertaken for 14 years after he has committed a torturable compliance of heroin traffic, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons in the traffic have been condemned at a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Dieta organized a meeting of questions/responses on himself while he said that his dream work would be avoided to represent customers in the death collar in America, his last invitation to meet would be Mohammed Ali and the illegality would be what it would motivate to work.

New request of collective resources against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new collective review request was made against the Saint-Christian brothers, relating to sexual attacks that would be disappeared this time at St. Joseph and in many orphelinates, colleagues and schools.
The request is supported on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J.J.J.", which would be masturbed in 1950, first in Our Dame-des-Neiges by his brother Sumis, and then by his convict, father Bernard, in the Saint-Joseph, where he was a mission and where his father worked as a piece.
The first review was not only three institutions, and when we have announced the Regulation, many people said to us, "I, I was in this place, can I write me?", said the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two challenges.
The collective review that has been deposited has to be particularly allowed to allow the adding of plaguers of any establishment where serbias could be perpetrated by members of the Holy Croix Congregation.
At the present time, the review is gathered by 25 people who are assuredly attacked by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The attached facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first review, since several of the establishments in 1960 closed their doors.
Furthermore, the Congregation of the Saint-Christian and the Hour of Saint-Joseph, who is a different entity, "they have allowed sexual difficulties to be perpetrated in the meeting of children," which "they have exercised a moral, religious and psychological contrast on the victims," which they were "in the corner of perpetrated sexual weaknesses and have yet been efficient," and that they had "scially and consciously chosen to ignore the problem."
These recent accusations are based on letters published by the lawyer of Saint-Croix, Me Emile Perrin, in 1990, but also by the researchs made in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an elder brother of Saint-Croix who published publicly the Germany.
The collective review must first pass the step of the receiveability in the Supreme Court.
Once the receipt of the Court is adopted, the second step, or the audits on the ground.
In the case of the first review, the Saint-Croix congregation had accepted to regulate the friendship before audiences were carried out on the ground.

The Canadian Congress of Pallyat Research, which is deployed this week in Ottawa, has occurred a few days after the vote for the principle of the law on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the diseases had access to efficiency to satisfy their sufferings, more than possible to stay in the house, very few of them would like to finish their days, according to a port-word of the Canadian Association of the palliative care, Maryse Bouvette.
If we put the accent on the palliative care in Canada, the approach of Utahania would be minimized.

He doesn't think the Antarctica's will build the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Deputy of Gatineau, Stephanie Vallee, state me that the end of life notation should be clarified before the law project is adopted.

“ Nobody will know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in The Nation, described the kenian media as a key control source in the public life.

A difficult year for pharmacians
The department of nearly 10 pharmacians in the Laval Health Centre and Social Services (CSSS) has caused a total emission to the hospital guideline of the City of Santé, and, in the year 2012-2013.
Because of multiple departments to retreat, maternity or department, the pharmacy department was very deficitful in personal.
It was about 30% of the necessary efficiency, bringing this financial year "with difficult," according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to be attached to an independent operation, which can cost to three times more precious than a pharmacian full-time.
We didn't have an excuse, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities were rationalised or decreased inside the establishment for the pillar, the time the things are replaced.
It is sure that we have worked strong to interest our young people [permanents in pharmacy] to come and stay here.
There is a concourse of circumstances that made us in a bad situation in the past year.
Higher position
After this past period, the year 2013-2014 announces very easierly for the CSSS Pharmacy Department.
Dejà, three pharmacians are returned to the work after their maternity congestion and three other pharmacians have been busy during the last months.
Furthermore, the efforts made by the Department to maintain have brought fruit, since the four students have also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS.
Now, it's a lot better, he underlined the pharmacian.
From here the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacians and three mothership returns.
This will therefore be filled with our departments of the past year.
Besoins always growing
However, the situation remains delicate.
Many factors, such as hospital pharmacians or a predominance of young women in the Mediterranean, make such situations as it lives in 2012 difficult to prevent.
For us [the number of efficiency] is always precious, because we have an environment that is young and we work many young women, so with adults, we are always rolled almost at three maternity conges when it's okay, she added.
The last year, we have had much more and we have no pharmacists that are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

An extrait from Nympheniac made the temperature on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provoking cineast asked his actors to put their pockets on the plater, he had reviewed professionals of X for the most exhausted sex scenes, before fusioning all bodys digitally: above the ceinture, it is the star; bottom, double.

Ukraine approaches the faility
The Standard & Poor's Notation Agency has exposed the note of Ukraine's solutionability, in doubt the capacity of the Soviet Ex-Republic, in recession for more than one year, to face its financial obligations.
The note of the public data of the country passes to "B-" in the specific investment category.
It's aware of a negative perspective, S&P, seeing at least one chance on three, it's reached from here a year.
"It is at least likely that the government's strategy allows to ensure enough foreign debts to face its needs for high external financing," explains the United States Agency.
The Agency raises that Ukraine's change reserves have fallen from 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and proposed that tendance continues.
This is full of the payment of credits taken in the foreign.
These reserves, in which the authorities have massively committed to support the local monetary, the hrivnia, with a floor, the judge of the Agency more likely to assess its external debt.
Kiev needs more liquidity to regulate its gas imports to Russia, which has not paid a facture of 882 million dollars.
This announcement constitutes a bad new new for the Ukraine power in a period of live tensions with his Russian neighborhood, furious from Kiev's will to sign a association agreement with the EU's end of November.
It was published on the next day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy was held between July and September its fifth trimester of contracting afterwards.
His end, still relatively modest, exploded these last years and S&P, at 33,5% of the PIB, in contrast to 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.
The country, in the budgetary deficit, claims to help the International Monetary Fund, which gave him in 2010 a credit of $15.3 billion, and has not deleted it at the moment only 3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to make any new tracks as the country would not adopt imputable reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by increased gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new non-profit mission in the country, the FMI stated this week that "the important needs for external financing" were "volnerability", although relevant "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for the Economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Political Education Centre, "We can't expect a short-term improvement."

The only hope is an improvement of international conjunction.
S&P replaces the "incertitude" linked to the possible signature of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels consists of the liberation of the opponent Joulia Timochenko.
"Attaching the Agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but it may have short- and average negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," explained S&P, which fears the " trade restrictions" of Moscow.

The Congolais Army forbids the rebels of the M23
The Congolais Army (FARDC) announced Jeudi that its units were going to shoot the rebels of M23 to their bases located in the forests and the mountains of the North-Kivu Limitrophe of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be struck after the locations of the north-est of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC) were disappeared from the beginning, 20 months ago, from the insurrection.
"We're going to continue the M23 and accuse it everywhere where he is hidden because it is criminals," said Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, the FARDC port-wort.
We don't have to leave them to reorganize because they married the congolated people for too long.
The time has come back to peace.
The M23 responsibilities have explained that locations were evacuated under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa, the political responsibility of the rebelion, reported on the RFI that these military reverses would not change their revendications to peacekeepers.
These recently, according to the Uganda Mediterranean, reached mercred in Kampala between the Government of Kinshasa and M23.
Acrochages are reported in the collines that dominate Bunagana, the last location in the hands of the insurgents to be caught this week, as well as to Runyoni, a colline where the M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
At their support in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, leaving head of the north-Kivu province, benefiting from the escape of the government guarantee and the passivity of the blue boxes of Monusco.
Goma's challenge brought the United Nations RDC Mission, the most important to the world in effects, to strengthen its mandate, and to make a quick interaction composed by South African soldiers, Malawi and Tanniens.
From its side, the major state of the FARDC has been reached and the army has passed to the official against M23, changing the war course.
The progress rate of government teams is today without previous.
"The M23 seems to touch his end," predicted an expert of congolian affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historical - it would be the first time Kingshasa Government had successful to fight a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no army group associated with Rwanda would be present in the East of the RDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, who does not make sure to support the M23 military support, constituted to the department of mutine congolian military olders.
The chief of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rowandais President Paul Kagame to be retained, announced a port-word of the Foreign Office.

"We live in the fear of the M23, we are traumatised," added this man.
The tests conducted by the Pastor Institute on a patient suspected to be infected by the coronavirus were revealed negatively, announced the Health Ministry.

Chevron, the second American petrolier company, has made a low state of its trimestrial benefit because of the low-down of its raffinage margins, while its production of petrole and gas increased all in the stage of the group's objectives.
His net profit of the third trimestre decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action a year before.
The analyzes issued by Reuters are in the middle of a benefit by $2,71.
The group produced 2,59 million petrol equivalent barles per day during the trimester, in high relation to 2.52 million bpj products a year before.
The company shows 2,65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production from 2017.
The major part of growth in the future years will provide its natural gas projects in Australia.
According to the cost of these projects, the annual investment expenditures increased seven billion dollars in two years and should be achieved by 36,7 billion dollars in 2013.
The benefits taken from the production activities have lead to the third trimestre, while the benefits of availability (with the raffination and the chemical production) have fallen from 45% to 380 million dollars.
This bottom of raffinage margins involves the whole sector.
So the principal competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil made a net profit, although its production of gas and petrole.
Transport of choice: the receiving jurisdiction
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year of $150 per school (a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from school transport to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in measure.
Before the changes brought to the last budget, there was no financial contribution recognised.
"It is a mediation service proposed by the Commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to it, the CSRS was invited to a medium and requested a further time to consider it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to concert and find solutions," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) does not want to comment.
The organization has only meaning that the mediation is part of the process in a statement.
Smoking around the end of the urgency of the Hotel-Dieu
It was made to the branch a few months ago by a part of personal and many syndicates, including the CGT, Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July "decaling the project's implementation calendar, and in particular the date of closement of urgents that could not intervene on 4 November."
An officially request made "for no risk on the support of urgents in Paris at the beginning of the hiver" but he also refused to not generate the PS campaign for a few months of the municipality.
Despite the ministerial consigns, the closement should even be effective at that date.
Even if, in APHP, we prefer to use the term of "transformation" or "change in the continuity".
At the end of 4 November, the bombers who were insured about a fourth of 40 000 annual passengers at the urgency of the Hotel-Diu will have all received to bring the thirty several cases per day to the urgences of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewing of the internals.
At the Hotel-Dieu, the internals specialized in urgent will leave lunch to five internal medicine.
With regard to the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is programmed for the current month.
"The service of the urgency of the Hotel-Dieu must be closed in the shortest time, and for us, it is on 4 November," ensure that the President of the Medical Commission of APHP, which supports the draft direction.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients carried out by the bombers, only people who come by their own means ", confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical responsibility of the new hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to take patients in urgently," he is tempting, assessing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the place to transfer serious cases.
Urgent doctors will stay on the place, and it will also be sure.
But it is in the ARS that it is to decide the closement of urgent service.
"The things are progressively done," Nicolas Peju, ARS's port-word for whom on 4 November, "No changes will be done in service terms."
"The Ministry has lying or have lying to us," deploys the urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Deposits of his head of the SMUR head of July beginning to have sent the frank against the reorganisation project, it is defined as a "alert launcher" against a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are training to live and asphyxyser of urgents that have been renewed for less than five years," he estimated.
For him, "if other Paris urgent services could absorbed the surplus, there would be no problem."
And they are regularly built.
For example, sometimes there are nine hours waiting at Lariboisière urgences.
In the ARS, it is considered that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not risked to represent a "balance" in other urgent services, which human means will be further strengthened.
In the ARS such as the APHP, we are defending the "new hospital model" already held out since October 7 and who should continue to accommodate 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
From here at the end of the year, liberal doctors should also participate in the implementation of a "permanence of ambulance".
"Where are we going if we ask people to auto-diagnostic," asks Gerald Kierzek for who "the concept of not serious urgency" is "dengerious" and marks a "medial regression".
This will pass as for the matrices of level 3.
People are not foolish, they'll go there where there's the best offer of care.
If the Ministry doesn't take any measure from this morning, we will change brackets, prevent Christophe Prudhomme, an urgent doctor and a member of the CGT Health CGT.
We will still be present in the context of the municipal campaign and we will think of a list.
In the Team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morisset, Vincent Roger, adviser UMP of Paris and election of 4th award, clearly announces that "see the parsian UMP was for the maintenance of urgences in the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to open them if they return to responsibilities."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has mentioned her again on Monday morning on France Inter that she had been spoken for a moratory to not shut up on 4 November.
If that was the case, she would mark her net disappointment, subline Bruno Julliard, her door-word.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legality on the ground, we can't allow it without an acceptable scheme of report to other hospitals.
Obama ends the audiences regarding the FMI and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to finish the audiences that she had done on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the framework of its information activities, indicates an American responsible, Jeudi.
This decision is part of the temptation of the White House to take the hand into the NSA audits after the ancient analysis of Edward Snowden, refugeed in Russia.
It is the first time the monitoring of the FMI and the World Bank has been mentioned by the information agent since the beginning of the scandal.
Asked on the subject, an American administration response replied: "The United States don't make an electronic monitoring with the seats of the World Bank and the FMI in Washington."
In expression under the board of anonymate, this responsibility did not determine if such surveillance was placed by the past.
Another official, he, indicated that Barack Obama had ordered to leave these practices during the past weeks.
This instruction was given at least at the same time that it has finished the audiences of the General ONU in New York.
In this context, the Secretary-General of Information has approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes, but has permitted them further.
The Commission has established new restrictions on the data that information agents are authorised to collect and has set a limit of five years for the conservation of these informations.
The United Nations welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of objectives to replace the objectives of the Miller Development (OMD), which had been established for 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world.
Australian diplomates have played a key role in the implementation of the "continuous development goals" destined to replace the OMDs, which will exceed in 2015, before the United Nations Fund on the sustainable development which started the vial in Rio de Janeiro.
They figured in the final project of the document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Mrs. Gilliard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said to the assessment of the summit that it was now the time to “pass the national interests. ”
“I am happy that Member States have accepted the process to establish universal sustainable development objectives (ODD),” added.
These ODDs support progress in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make the maximum to acquire me of the mandate which the Member States have trusted me to fulfil our view of sustainable development objectives that support the success of the OMD.
The concern linked to security in Mozambique has grown at the same time as conflicts are exclaimed between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, President of the Mozambique's founder, thousands of people were gathered together in the Centre of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want the stability,” states Vanessa de Susa, Director General of an investment company.
It is concerned for the future of her country, she has changed her work clothing against a tee-shirt, taking the word "We want security" in Portuguese before to join the massageed people on the place of the Independence of the Jewish capital.
During two weeks, there were practically every day of the reports that have made conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst achieved since the peace agreement that has been signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was a famous rebel movement, supported by the Roads governed by whites and the Government of South Africa in the framework of efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think that the country should not return into a open conflict, but recent events have broken foreign investors and local population.
It is important for the economy in full growth, since the detection of large gas reserves of offshore and carbon gishing in the north-west could achieve more than 50 MD$ investment in the next years of society such as Rio Tinto, Vale de Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the party of the power and the main political strength since 1975, and Renamo is mutually rejected the responsibility of tensions.
Renamo states that the Government is in the origin of the recent attacks and that he has struck an attack against its members in the Province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo on 17 October.
The assaults on the old rebellious rebellions were then degened when the government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the door-word of Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government commits Renamo's responsibility to have declared conflicts, and the accusation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza seeks to minimize the concerns on the instability.
Mr. Guebuza declared mercredi to the AFP, the French Press Agency, that Mr. Dhlakama was considered as a "perder" who wanted to use "all the forces he remained to prove that he could put his decisions to the government."
The Frelimo and Renamo intend to say that they both want to disappear war.
But the concern was great after Mr. Mazanga stated that Renamo left the peace agreement in 1992.
He said to the FT that he wanted to mean that the agreement was not more respected by the Frelimo.
“ We want to take the negotiations again, but with the most serious ones, ” states Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have not succeeded to satisfy the tensions eaten by a series of conflicts this year.
Joseph Hanlon, a conference of the open and special university of the Mozambique.
No one of them knows how to negotiate, and no one of them is ready to make the necessary conceits.
Renamo, which is for electoral reforms, has already said that it would be a boycotting the municipal elections before have been located in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are provided in the next year.
Some comments interpreted its use of force as the temptation of a sick movement to obtain conceits and a war treacher from the government.
The part of the sufferings collected by Renamo is not stopped down since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by an ancient member of Renamo, should have received a larger number of sufferings to the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should be removed to the end of his second mandate in the next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparency elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We don't know exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but she has brought clear perturbative attacks on the police commissions and vehicles on a major north-sud-sout axis.
Most accrochages have been located in the Province of Sofala, which is located at several hundreds of kilometres in the north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port of the minières, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export the carbon.
In June, Rio could no longer use the ferry path for a week after Renamo had threatened to attack the ferry line.
Mr. Mazanga was famous when we asked him whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “watch the international community that things are not well in Mozambique, ” stated Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the Government, stated Fernando Lima, Director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, of many people who are also concerned by corruption, development leader, and the recent vague of emergency.
"The people think that the responsible for the future of the country is the Government and the President, and that it is the last to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a manifestant, said that people only wanted stability.
“Nobody supports Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads," added.
It would have to teach mythes and leads to children as “the models of life, ” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that “the brutal force does not make the pain of the subtile Russia, ” while the arthrian leaders reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many mythes would be "beautiful, too violent, very scandale and in some cases, very obsessionally to be teached in school," Crossley-Holland predicted a "minute choice" of the works adapted to the age.
"I find wonderful that in America, mythes and people are already part of education," he said.
I appreciate this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “deactically opening ” make the children“ completely decreased, ” the messages are“ sublimited ” in favorable historys.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the anglo-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of view."
Perhaps the great difference between a adult author written for adults and adult author for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended well, but there is an increasing sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; explained through a story instead of the statement.
The base is known of what we show and that we don't say.
A fighter of the army band of Hamas was killed tonight and another shot by a Israeli car shooter in Gaza band, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activities led a front-term monitoring operation in the Palestinian territory and Israel when they had explored an exploitation of an Israeli blinder.
NSA Speaking: United States are "so far away", admit Kerry
The United States are sometimes going to "trop away" for spionage, recognized the Secretary-General of State John Kerry, in this first aviation of Washington in full polymical air with Europe on the massive collection of data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scanning, revelations and delegations between the United States and their European Aliments, it is the first time that an American government responsible is expressly admitted by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I conceive you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this is not going to come to the future," said John Kerry in a conference to London, which he participated from July 31 October from Washington.
In its intervention, in the presence of his British homologic William Hague, the chief of American diplomacy has longly justified information and collection practices by the needed anti-terrional fight and prevention against events of attention.
Invoking the attention of 11 September 2001, Madrid's attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry ensures that the United States authorities had been delighted from many attention projects, by intercepting communications and collection of information.
"We actually stopped that aircraft falls, that buildings are not explored and people are murdered, because we were able to be at the top of these projects," argumented the officer of the American diplomacy.
And, John Kerry said to the address of the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been broken."
But we are trying to gather information.
"It's true, in some cases it's gone too far inadequately," admitted the Secretary of State, which had already had to be expressed on this international scanne in Paris, London and Rome last week.
He assessed Jewish night that President Obama was "decisive to try to clarify and to proceed to a review of these practices so that no one would feel threatened."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to affect this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted hundreds of million users of Google and Yahoo.
The journal, which quotes documents received by the NSA Edward Snowden, indicates that the baptized program "MUSCULAR", and sent with the NSA's British homologation, the GCHQ, allows these two agents to receive data from the optic fibres used by the Internet managers.
In the meaning of one of the documents, some 181 million elements were collected during the last January, with metadata on emails, text or audio or video documents.
These intercepts would be located outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have all linked to these practices.
Since ten days, several major journals in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have declared that the NSA would have intercept massively data and communications with the United States and their leaders, in particular the chance of German Angela Merkel.
Failed to the wrath of European States and when escapes in the US press indicated that the President of America was not at the time of such hearing, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, calling national security.
In contrast, the Leader of the NSA, General Keith Alexander, declared him that his information agent had taken tens of millions of European citizens communications.
He even sent the balle to European information services that would be taken from these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be concerned about " military operations" in countries in which these Otan's alibi cooperated with the United States and that would not be absolutely European, the general Alexander reported.
And the polemic was wide in Asia.
Indonesia invited Australia's embattery, which is accused to be used by the Americans in the framework of a large international spione network that also has reached China.

A ceremonie in memory of cremated deficits
The crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes at 11 hours a laying ceremony, in memory of all crematic deficits in its establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate in Paris's madrid must assist, and then will explain its proposals on the funeral conference.
To follow the ceremony, click up.
For their own obsessions, more Frances choose the creation, instead of inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study held on 6 and 7 September at 1009 people instead of 47%.
For the obsessions of a nearby, it is the inverse: Frances prefer inhumation (53% against 47%).
If they have the worse to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose creation.
In his book The Death in Cennes, Damien Le Guay, Philosophe and Vice-President of the National Ethics Committee of the Federal Federation, is inquired on the "floorence" that constitutes creation for survivors.
There is, with the creation, "a violence made in the loved body", which will be "reduced to a pitch of cendres" in a lot of time, and not after a decomposition process, which "along the phases of the dust."
There is also a "symbolic violence", which includes the "leveling of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymate" of the cancers.
Why is what is accepted without fear in some north and protesting countries still lives in France?
"Because the creation is a new fact," replied Mary-Fredéric Bacque, President of the Delegation Society and author of the book Apprivois the death.
She is only tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the trials to learn it.
To appreciate the creation, it is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director General of the Federal Services in Paris, to prevent a cérémonie that it would have right with an inhumation.
The annual investigation of Ipsos shows a very strong annex to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French wants one for their neighbors to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Then, 73% of the people who have chosen a cremation wants the organization of a ceremony.
66% of the athates or unbelievers want it also.
Crematoriums have been adapted to this society's development.
"After a decade of years, they tried to escape familys the violence of an attentive, without doing nothing, for a half hour, immediately followed the delivery of the cends," Mr. Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the institutions now propose the masters of ceremonies, which proceed in the presence of the body, in the following rituel: accusing the assembly, nominating the defence, reliant to others, calling it, to give sense to his death, to organize the assistance.
This is the case of the crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
The ceremonie masters often are people who have turned back.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in this framework that the Creatory of the Father of Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several cérémonies of the memories, laïcs and non-religious, to whom he invites the families of people who have been created in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonys has been redirected to the attention of those who could not be moved.
The crematorium allowed us to relax it.
In La Seyne, the relocation for rats turns to polymetic
In the beginning of a week, a family left his apartment in rez-closed room from the Fructidor D2 building, because of the presence of rats .
Before the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Terres Office of South Habitat proposed, exceptional and provisional ways, to relocate the couple and his three children in a new T4.

We are immediately without the summer and waiting for a new apartment, even as the old tariff.

Ben Greenman : Tenteenth anniversary of New York Comdy Festival : The New Yorker
We could say that the city of New York is the place where the standup was born in America: about 100 years ago, the Vaudeville Frank Fay's actor, who had the role of ceremonies in the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell the plot directly before the public, on the sound of the conversation.
Fay's innovation was perpetual for years, until the New York Comdy Festival was reviewed recently.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up Carolines Club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 spektrums presented in small clubs and great teatros.
“ Most of the View Heads have seen Caroline, and have known a great success, until they become too nice to play in a club, ” said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to continue to work with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comédia and music evening in the benefit of old fighters, organized in Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the wide, as the people of the comédia.
Many comités participating in the festival of this year have passed through non-traditional circuits, for example, spektrums on small TV chains, such as Comdy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a chain chain (The League) on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lassif of the FXX chain) and then his own spectacle of sketchs on the Comdy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the “Saturday Night Live” emission and made part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation", but it is still more known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young cohedians in the single voice (the surrealista Pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of the racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the world decentralized of the American commission.
One of the major factors of the festival attraction this year will be a treatment: David Steinberg discutering with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comité, but it became a fulfilled digital and television realisator, as well as an official story of the comité.
Between 2005 and 2007, he animated an emission on TV Land who was called "Sit Down Comdy with David Steinberg".
You've got it at the Ville Hotel in Manhattan Center.
"The city is definitively in the Comic DNA of all Larry's work," states Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a role between two buildings and said, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'm coming here.
The price of the petrol continued down and closed by 96 dollars of the bar
The price of the petrol continued to be low-free, while the concerns on the importance of stocks consist of a report showing that the chinese manufacturer gourmand in electricity is in force.
The price of the American reference price for delivery in December was low from 14 cent to 96,24 dollars in the end of the morning in Europe in e-mail changes on the New York Mercantie Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract has lost 39 cents of Jewish, which is laid down with a low 5,8% for the month of October.
The absent offer of brute petrole was low on the price during the past weeks.
The American Energy Department indicated mercredi that the American approvals had increased 4.1 million bars last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barils have increased.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturer sector arrived in Friday, which showed a growth of activities, suggested an increase of demand.
This allows that China's economic recovery could continue to reaffirm after the growth was rebounded to 7,8 % to the third trimester, after a decrease that it was not known since two decades at the previous trimester.
Brut Brent, a reference for the international brute already used by American raffineries, has lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Remitted due to the right to adventure in Texas
A federal court of call was restored to Texas some restrictions to the voluntary interruption right of growth which had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in this State and a widely relied because of the right to advocate will be able to enter into force.
The arrest held by the call court means that doctors who will practice IVG should have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The admission privilege is the right of a doctor, in accordance with his member state of a hospital, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
The IVG defenders assess that the content of the law is risked to be translated by an immediate closement of a third of the Clinics of the State because these clinics have not been able to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practices.
In general, it would be about 22,000 women who would be private from access to these institutions.
Monday, a judge of the first instance was considered at the guard of the entry into force of the law that the provisions that are treated on the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional.
But the General Astorney of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who broke the governor's position, asked the court of call to reject the judgment of the first instance that blocked the law's application.
A plenary audience on this question is provided for January.
The New Star has successfully returned in force, near audiences, with 1,3 million telespectors behind their television position, or 5,6% of audience.
But the spectacle was you?
Some 10 000 candidates were presented to the audiences of this 10th saison, to face the jury: Maurane, the bad Sinclair, the reason why André Manukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, telespectors shared their comments.
In the past the excitation of finding their favorite programme, many have been discovered.
But why so much deception?
No candidate seems to have actually marked in this first price.
As each year, the first audit emissions brave a large choice of cantors in herb, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want the spektrum, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Happy, some have found their accounts.
They are many to try the New Star, and sometimes even to go to the top.
After TV screens, successful song calls are still there, saison after saison.
Others have just the ambition to make rid of.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and fool policy
A federal court of call has been locked on the decision of a judge required changes in the control and fuel programme of the police department of New York, and it has denied the document.
The Court of Appearance of the United States (the second circuit) indicated that the decision of the judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the exit of the call interimed by the city.
The judge had stated that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and question the citizens.
The city called its conclusions and its correct orders, in particular a decision to assess a controller to help the police department to edit its policy and the training programme associated with him.
The Court of Call has heard married the arguments on the request of suspension.
The Court of Appearance stated that the court should be denied from the document because it had enhanced the code of conduct of the judges by comprometing the need for a judge to escape any apparence of partiality, in particular because of a series of maintenances provided to the media and public declarations in which it was published publicly responsible to the critics of the court.
The Court stated that police officers violate the citizens of thousands of people in the case of black and Spanish origin in the framework of their control and fool programme.
She designed a external controller to monitor the changes, including the reform of policies, training and monitoring, and she ordered the implementation of a pilot program to test cameras carried out on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are developed.
In August, the city of New York accepted to end the practice consistent to maintain the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after a police control.
The audience of the call interimed by the city should be located after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of control and fuel was criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and fuel system exists since decades under a certain form, but the number of recorded controls increased aspectively under the administration of Michael Bloomberg, in order to achieve its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly affected black and hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all of minorities, and was transformed in collective action.
The participants who carried out changes in the NYPD control and fuel programme say that they will end in illegal practices, let them have more effective police forces and to whom they are trusted, and they can change the way police departments use the policy.
The opposers say that these changes would reduce the police moral without delaying criminality, represent a money gagling, and would not resolve the largest problem of police forces under pressure after police effects were strongly reduced during the last decade.
The Court submitted that it would not end the control and fool practices, which are constitutional, but that it would reform the way the NYPD had implemented its controls.
The locators have to go to vote, because each of them paid in average $100 per month on the price of the residence that goes in taxes to the Ville.
When the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each apartment.
We are obligated to increase the loyalty to help us pay the new tax.
By voting, we will send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All candidates told us that they would attack the scandal deal.
We don't have any more way to pay for 1000,000 dollars, lands of 4 to 5 million dollars for the case where...
Let's vote, it's the best way to express you and to say it's enough.
Final service for the cooking chief of Elisée
In the 500 m2 of the elegant cooks as committed after working in ambassades, the cuisine graved all the scales until he becomes chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, Georges Pompidou in Francois Holland through Nicolas Sarkozy, including their vacances, and eat an incalculable number of great worlds in a nearly anonymate that he breaks only today at the time of retrait, at 60 years.
The man on the open face, the corner and the entire balances, born on October 24, 1953 in the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is a titular of a PAT.
His mother was a cuisine in a chamber of Sologne.
"I'm passed from one chamber the other!", Ironis Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six Presidents for whom he has employed, but also their wives and some of their invitations.
"It's always the head of State or his company or wife who chooses the menus," remembers he.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more implied, she came directly in cook," as she had prohibited women in the cookers of Elisea!
It moves to the heads of State who showed a relative distinction to earthly food, "they are all gurmands," says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac was sure "a little more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the bag, the assets returned empty!
For Francois Holland, who restored the ship, "It's someone who loves eating" and "It's not a big-chose that he doesn't like."
The current chief of the State, who reached the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has not "no specific regime request".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that he had suffered on his grounds, especially in the State dinners in Elisea: "I need to use between 200 and 250 people at an hour."
The last night is almost white.
Those people wouldn't understand that there were errors.
The old chief of the cookers of Elisée, who took a nice night with his team, his family and friends, part with a painting in the heart."François Hollande came to salute me."
He said the elogs.
"On man's side is resorted," he said.
The chief will be replaced by his advice, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, which is for his part since seventy years to Elisée.

Coulson used the phone piratery to check a tuya
The old editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson would have used “the telephone pirate, the monitoring and the confrontation” to try to confirm a bidon cycle on a connection involved by the Ministry of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Professor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false room in May 2005 according to which Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “favour special advice”.
It was reported to the court that the journal carried Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, pirate the phrase box of Pawlby and "plant permanently before his door," but Coulson also called it and left him vocabulary messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who then is the editor of the head of NotW, is not the type of man to stay before the house of people who hope to surprise them, is the kind of man to love his story to see what they say."
He stated that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: telephone pirate, monitoring and confrontation.
The main editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is at the second, the monitoring, he can't be differently.
But what's the first?
Does he know the phone pirate?
He says the contrary, but we say “be sure that it is. ”
The rumers on an impliant relationship with Clarke were first recovered by the office of NotW's edition when a source, testing a sexual attack against Mrs. Pawlby, said that we had said: "Don't lose your time with her, she is with Charles."
A band, on which pirate call messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was entered in the house of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The researchers also found instructions on the computer of the private detective who were concerned Mrs. Pawlby and his sisters in a folder "Projects".
During the period where the detective investigated it, Mrs. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about it, Mr. Edis added.
At least, the old reporter in Neville Thurlbeck and the old reporter James Weatherup have monitored the monitoring of the detailed and management of Mrs. Pawlby.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow where I really want to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the implication of Coulson in the history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as the elder Minister of the Interior David Blunckett.
The jury heard that Mr. Blunkett had confronted Mr. Blunkett on a married woman while he was often the co-defender of Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not have conspired with others to pirate phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have accepted the telephone piratement.
Barack Obama received the first Iraqi Ministry, full of violence

Bombs struggle markets, muscles, marriages and funerals.
Mans are in full road or even in their homes, and security forces are also the objective of frequency attacks.
The growing disagreement of the substantive minority, in the power under Saddam Hussein, who agreed to be politically marginalised and to be the objective of unjust resistance, has favored this flamme of violence.
Vendredi, new violences killed four people in the north of Iraq, at the next day of death of at least 26 people in a series of warnings, including the explosion of five cars in the north of Bagdad.
A good part of violence has been impressed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIL), a group in Al-Qaida (Sunnitant Extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "the World War" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is in the center of the Treaty in the United States of the Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be sold by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the President of America, electioned on the promise to end the military engagement in this country, had been a optimist table of the situation.
Since he arrived in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki multipled meetings with the executive, and the elections of the Congress.
Jeudi, he pleased the international community to bring a "the third World War" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased aid to Iraq in security is supported by republic senators and democratic influences.
But these recents also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a challenge, contributing to his party responsibility for the renewing of violence by his "sectoral and authorised policy".
They also requested Barack Obama to understand Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicial influence in the Iraq government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."

RDC: Army attacks the last fifth of rebels
The unreductives of M23, or some hundreds of fighters, were broken nearly 2000 meters of height on Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations located at about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the north-Kivu province.
"It wasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue at night," said the AFP, an inhabitant from Jomba, joined by phone at 12:30, and according to what a girl was hurt by the balle in the morning.
"The intensity of the opposite has decreased a little," added he, "It seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the RDC have repeated a little rebellious."
According to this witness, who wanted to stay anonymous, the soldiers had "with the night" to Jomba before they go to the front for a "rapist operation".
We heard very well behind him food crepitations of small weapons.
From Bunagana, five political and last strong place of the Mediterranean Rebelion, a journalist of the AFP could hear detonations of severe weapons.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the stabilization of the RDC, fights are "in a final phase," FARDCs who have "restricted the positions of the M23 to delay them."
Since the repeating, Friday, the relationship between the Movement of 23 March (M23) and the Army is not directly participating in the fights, but it provides government teams a determinant support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the next day, several hundreds of soldiers, well approved in municipalities, moved on the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and lance-rockets.
A little later, on the road to Bunagana, front-frontier with Uganda, military citizens helped citizens carried a multiple rocket smoking on a FARDC new carrier, before energy reaching another energy pioneering the positions of M23 on the collines.
The Congolian President, Joseph Kabila, called to the Rebellions to "demobilize volunteerly" to be disarmad "with the force," but left Kampala's process, where Kinshasa and M23 discussed since December without result.
On the other hand, M23 political leaders hoped to come to a agreement.
"We have finished the parliamentary, there is no more than the Uganda Mediterranean to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the Delegation of M23, without that this information could be confirmed immediately from the Government side.
The M23 was born from a mutinery, in April 2012, of ancients of rebellious, essentially, integrated in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
UN and Kinshasa are regularly accused of Uganda and Rwanda to support the M23, which refuse Kigali and Kampala.
North-Kivu is one of the most deeply deeply lacked regions of the RDC, and its sub-sol regrets of convoided mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the border side of the border, where about 5000 people were refugeed between lunch and mercredi according to the United Nations, the return movement to the RDC that was on the morning turned into the middle day.
"Tomorrow we have traveled to go to our fields, but the militarys have told us to reply," said the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, around his nine children, including a food on the dose.

The musical comédie, this scene beast
Classic, sophisticated, populary, English or French, single and dancing produces their emergency.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical seems to be a successful type.
Long-times, from Our-Dame of Paris in Mozart, the rock operated, most of the trials were impressed in the ridicule.
And the successs such as Cabart or the Misherables brought the mystery's aureole.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to Chatelet and Stage Entertainment to Mogador has changed the donation.
Today, these two scenes have the titles as successful tubes.
The first reception, this Noël, his excellent Lady My Fair Lady, and announces for the following world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Belle and the Beet" could be a success of the saison.
On the other scenes, musical spektrums such as "1789", "Bastille's lovers" and small musical comédiaes such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are located at the division of success and quality.
Patrick Nedo, the author of the Referency Book "Music Comeds" and conferring to the Chatelet Theater of Chatelet, analysed the reasons of success as hardly conquired.
How do the French musical comeds develop?
The offer was demultiplicated.
First, there are the "music spectacles" that develop in the gray of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a real story like in 1789, the Bastille Amants.
Others do a 15-year-old bottom under pretext that can be used at least near anything when Matt Pokora is in the front of the view.
Afterward, we have musical cohesions with the famous products of the Châtelet that make us review the gold age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Popular Entertainment stage of English-saisons of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French manufacturers try a perceivement.
But current projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Aranished Woman" or "The Prememps Eve" have bad to be financed.
Do we have enough able artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there's eight music spectacles in a saison, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the branch of the musical comité, it is very different.
Youths are formed for these methods in many schools.
Works are many between regional teaters, turned, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent living is also the number of posts to be performed.
Why are they so successful?
Without the operation, the country remains the poor parents of the culture in France.
A few teatri parts are turned into the ground and often is the boulevard teatro destined to adults and not to young adults.
Musical spectacles combine this missing.
These are the same young people who love the telereality and what she produces as economy stars...
Propose beautiful young men (seely talentable) in the head of a musical spectacle, it is the ensure of a commitment of these young girls and often of their whole family.
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are permanently held by professionals who respond to questions.
These spectacles are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
Mayonise is moved to Paris and denied by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter into all the large sales of France under the same form as Paris.

RDC: The Army prepares a new challenge
Children play on a carbonized blind that was apparent to the rebels of M23 in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in East of the RDC.
The Congolese Army was prepared for a new attack against the last bases of rebels in the M23 near Bunagana, East of the RDC.
The objective is to disappear the M23 collines overflowing Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina's colline, who surrounds the Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should have fallen from herself.
He's not gonna stay more than Runyonyi's colline.
"The Chanzu is not very strategy," the AFP indicated the governor of the North-Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku wanted to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Five political and last strong place of rebelion, this location is located at the Uganda border, about 80 km north of Goma.
She has been renewed by the Army Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Mercedes Congo.

NSA revelations increase the paranoia of enterprises in respect of State monitoring
In an excellent end day of August, a German helicopter helicopter overseered the British Consulat of Francfort, the Financial Capital of Germany.
According to the Federal Office of Constitution (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the board of the American advance-post, located at least 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BFV would expect to identify the presence of audits and that the operation has exchanged between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of American information services, reiterated in September that the United States do not use their capacity for foreign knowledge to “avoid the industrial secrets of foreign enterprises for the United States account to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their benefits”.
But since Edward Snowden became delegator, the consultor began to devote his unexpectable information treatment on the secrets of the observance of the United States, the European governments and undertaking leaders do not know any more if the director should believe in the word.
Reports, according to which the National Security Agency has spent the Brazilian Petrobras petroliar company and has received access to data held by American providers of store services in Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have been more than ever submitted the paranoia of enterprises in respect of State surveillance.
The revelation according to which the phone of the German chance Angela Merkel had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the water bottle that made the gas.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be viewed, the business leaders are sure also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparency the intensive cooperation between American information services and enterprises.
I hope that it is conceived that these data are used in their mutual interest.
“The Germany must wake up,” states Oliver Green, President of BITMi, who represents German PMEs in the TI sector.
The German society think that the United States represent an important risk as the Chinese when it is industrial and data flying, according to an investigation published in July by the EC Council Office.
However, in all documents devoted by Mr. Snowden, it does not indicate that the United States had transmitted foreign business secrets to American society.
Political men have taken part of their concern to the idea that the EU does not have sufficient information and Internet capacity and think that it should strengthen its dependence in respect of the United States.
First leaders are sceptic to this matter.
A German Parliament has said that we should create a German Google.
I can't just shut up the eyes and slowly shut them down...
"It's not the good way to do," says Hasso Platner, President of the German firm software company, SAP.
If we wanted a European IT industry, then it would not have to leave her to die 20 years ago.
Everything is subventioned in Germany, carbon to cars through agricultors.
Except the TI industry.
However, the width and sophistication of the United States Spionage Agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a choc for some enterprises who thought that China represented the largest risk in monitoring terms.
A great change is to be made in the low computer because the European responsibilities have taken aware that the data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation made by Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organism, some 10% of the non-American members rejected their projects to use an American storage service provider in the cloud after the statements on the American data exploring program of Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers are today a question that they didn't put us a year ago: where are my data stored and you can guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, to know that the powerful states want to flee their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic spy.
I've always been there.
"It's a recurring subject since many years and nothing has basedly changed in the framework of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the Product Company of Chemical Products.
The Americans spend us on the trade and industrial plan as we spy them, because it is in national interest to defend our businesses.
The business leaders are generally not inclined to declare the prevention measures that they have placed, in the case it would leave the advantage of an adversary.
Large companys march the message since long as it is at least unreasonable to get a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a porttable computer without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the Audi Automatic Builder Administration Council, states that the collection of portable phones before the meetings of the advisory, so that they cannot be used as remote audit devices, is a current practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to examine the use of simple portable phones provided for by their journeys to the foreign, because of the risk of expectance to the integrity of smartphones.
The portable phones are then thrown.
However, it is afraid that small and medium enterprises remain vulnerable to pirate and monitoring.
In Germany, many PMEs are global leaders in their special neighbour.
“The PMEs are often missing experience, personal and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unautorised access,” warned the BFV in a report.
The United States warn their own society on the activities of economic speeds made by other countries.
The National Extimate Intelligence (NIE), held in February by the United States, cited France, even as Russia and Israel, in the second degree of economic pirateing acts, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Administration Council of a Germany renamed company estimated that when it is economic speed, "Francians are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, ancient director of the French internal information, the DCRI, said in a treatment this month: "The services know perfectly that all countries, even if they are involved in fight against terrorism, sprang their alities."
Parents of a Jeorgian boy, who is deceived in insolent circumstances, think that their son has been murdered
Parents of a boyfriend of Georgia, whose body was found in a rolled battle tape in the cycle of his school, thinking that their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the Jewish family.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on 11 January in a supported tape behind the grades of his school.
The investigators of the officer of the Lowndes Corte concluded that Johnson was decisived in the insolent circumstances, but the family of the young boy of 17 years has the conclusions.
“They are absolutely certain that their sons were murdered, ” said Benjamin Crump, the representative of Kenneth and Jacqueyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as it was indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.
“ They think that it disappears all the logical, physical laws and common senses, ” adds Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered to the only purpose of covering the persons or persons responsible for death of their son.
"They sent their sons to school with a cart, and they gave them in a dead sack," he added.
The Prosecutor of the United States Michael Moore stated that he had a official investigation on Johnson's death, submitting that several important issues remained without answer.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore was expressed in a Jeudi press conference after midnight.
I'm going to give the facts where they're going.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open a official research, he said.
Moore told the journalists that the first autopsie indicated that Johnson was decisived by “positive asphyxie. ”
However, a second autopsie identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“More questions are still a response or confirmation,” he indicated.
Moore added that if he places the day of nature elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to take it.
The representative of the office of the Office of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him with Jewish.
A judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to renew all videosurveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The parents of the adolescent told them that they hoped that video images contain indications on the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in the child for schools
Mercredi, the United States Control and Prevention Centre has published a series of directives indicating how to management children's food allergies in school.
It is the first series of guidelines that the American government publishes, since the number of children in school age suffering food allergies has been strongly broken.
A child over 20 in the United States suffers today of food allergies.
The CDC discovered that the prevalence of food allergies in the child increased 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidance contains information destined to schools on the way to sensibilisate the professional body and the personal to food allergies in the child, and on the way to treat them in allergic reaction.
He also recommends schools to have an epinephrine stock — the EpiPen auto-injector with the most recently used – to quickly react in potentially mortal analphylaxie.
The legislative assemblies of the States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to be easier to have the epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who have a allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I have the impression that something meet the language," "I have the impression of having a hair on the language" or "I have piotes on the language."
The NSA Affairs subscribes the total absence of discussion on information
How to explain the contradict attitude of the French Government, which is of a public party involving the United States Ambassador on 21 October, and the other prohibited the surrounding of the territory by the President Bolivia, on the basis of the presence room at Edward Snowden's border?
According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande phone in Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius calls the United States Ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the widow of American monitoring on all communications in France.
Isn't it surprised to read in the columns of the World for a few weeks of a part of the playing of the American diplomatic correspondence and otherwise a condemnation of the audiences of the NSA?
Isn't it like a vague hypocrisy from your part?
The journalist approach is not a moral position, but the research of interest and the pertinence of information that allows each citizen to refuse a opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the ball on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or others in the whole world, we really consider that, in view of the power of America, this is a important lighting.
When we describe the American intercept systems with the French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case to ensure us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations regarding our interests?
Can we take care of the American cooperation?
The implementation of many ten years of technology tools of interception from the United States, but also by France, was officially justified by combating terrorism.
Furthermore, France and the United States have, in particular, established cooperation procedures and changes of almost quotidian information and are described as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was signed to France through the NSA.
France may, for example, be conducted to transmit all data blocks on the area of Sahel to American services, and, in contrast, it has already been said - the Americans can give the French information on other regions of the world.
So the question behind this NSA is not so much the capacity or the right of the countries to obtain intercept tools, as the question of the total absence of prevalent debate, in particular within the Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that should be their, and, finally, the question of freedoms.
What really risks the United States, a degradation of their image?
We're beautiful to deny them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk running by the Americans may be double.
The first, it is when their associates - and it was the recent case - they learn that their leaders, sometimes, were observed at the highest top of their state.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries in which diplomatic relations with the United States are treated.
Another effect may be more economic: more than European or South America's companies requies to the light of the revelations, to trust their confidential data to American providers under the United States laws, and thus to the NSA undertaking.
The last element: the large movement of revelations undertaken by media throughout the world, which contributes to fulfill a debate on the monitoring practices of information services to almost unexistent, could use legislators, including Americans, to recognize the powers that they have given to their information services.
Interessed children parents can choose “indefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize a third sex for foods born with ambiguous sexual bodies.
The male or female female of new births will no longer be assigned to them, in a rich way, to birth.
In the framework of the new law, parents will no longer have to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to write a “indefined” sex or“ not specified” on his birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that had been able to take precise decisions on sexual resignation for their food, and to fight discrimination with interexexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would say for years later, “I am not a man nor a woman. ”
I'll stay the patchwork that made the doctors, comforted and balabred.
We love that a child of 20,000 births each year is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, the intersexuality of the group of 60-year-old diagnostic disease as sexual development disorders, a generic term that designs persons with chromosomes or gone (or tests) or sexual bodies that are normally developed.
Wallis Simpson could be intercepted.
Sexual identification is not yet well understood, but most of the US experts say that when the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assess it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before examining a cyrurgical act, the case.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiater in New York and specialist of sexual identification issues, stated that the new German law “seems to be a good idea. ”
Intersessed children have a ethical dilemma.
“ Some people suffer extremely serious diseases that require a chirurgical act, but it is not the case of most children, ” added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and to see how identity is developed.
Science that is to know how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of knowing why this happens.
It's like mystery around homosexual persons.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the intersecutive persons as different from transsexual or transgeneral persons, since their statute is not linked to sexual, but instead of their biological constitution, which is not exclusively the man or the exception of one woman, but in general is both in the same time and not clearly defined as one or another.
These characteristics can be manifested from themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, pilosure, poetry and stature), primary sexual characteristics (e.g. reproductors and sexual bodies) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also showed a view to discrimination with which the intersexual and transgenerated persons in the employment, as well as the extension of the acts of harmfulness and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
The young boys of non-conformity have now camps that are specially destined to them.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to write masculin, female or “the third sex ” on their official documents.
In June, a Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized “neutral” after he had gathered his process in call that allows him to keep a non-specific sex in life.
German passports shall be a third design by M or F – X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In France nearby, the kinds of issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, twelve legislators of this country have signed a petition to “theory of Genesis” to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online website has also opposed the German law, writeing that “as the world is trained in a new kingdom where the kind is a choice but where sexual activities are not one, we turn two other civilization pilars.”
In Maryland, the mother of a food said also about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be assigned to children to their birth.
“ The role of parent is sufficiently stressed without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child, ” she said on the site designed to young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without sexual bodies were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the Greek Greek Greek who had a double sex.
And there was a decade of years ago, the medical community considered the genre as a smoke, which can be cleaned, and on which we can renew.
But then, many are those who reject the ethical foundation of the chirurg, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can tremble, don't know how a child will feel his sexual resignation when he grows.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric urgency, ” says Drecher.
When these children were born, they were not called the psychiater, they were phoned to the chirurg.
The dominant theory on the way to treat the children forbidden of ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, of the University of Johns-Hopkins, who considered that the genre was depressive.
He made the term “sexual identity” and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents teach a child – interact with the Genesis and hormones of a child to make it to be identified as a masculin or female sex.
But in a case of 1966, known under the name of John/Joan, his theories were given to controversy.
He was advised to the parents of a little boy whose penis was caught during a bunched circumcision to make it entirely casting him, taking up the witnesses, and to elect him as a girl.
“The money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't the case," said Drescher.
At about 15 years, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38, he was murdered.
Drescher stated that some doctors “repeated this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the Internet arrived, those who have survived these sexual change operations say: “[who] they are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who is born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors couldn't really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “hearted life ” as a man.
So a little while after her birth in 1976, Bruce went up a cheurgyal ablation of the external organ and witnesses and was higher as a girl.
We took him female hormones in 12 years old.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said about ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he went up a vagina.
But depressed and realized that something wasn't going, he asked his medical dossier.
What he discovered was scared.
I was sterilized to birth – and no one never told me.
Bruce is born with a sexual development disarmament (DDS) that has stopped her body to produce enough testosteron to develop its sexual bodies.
After learning the truth, he returned a man, following a treatment to the testosteron, and made him to remove the skins.
The chirurg made it a sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, who trys to normalize the perception of intersexual persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general director of the non-profit organization based on California Advocates for Informed Choice, fearing that the German law “invites the label and stigmatization”.
“A lot of activities concerned that German law encourages parents to take fast decisions and give their children a "indefined sex"," she said.
We are afraid she encourages interventions.
We think he'd be better attributing a male or female sex, and waiting.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only go ahead of hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported the Australian law because “he allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sixth call.”
“The adults should be able to take their own decisions on a legal type,” she added.
The German Law relates to the asset of sex to birth.
It's not a battle that young children should go to this age.
When they grow, they may take decisions on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, specialised in the mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is achieved from a disorder of sexual development and helping thousands of people in a group of support, has stated that German law will “a responsibility ” to parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, is born with male chromosomes, but suffers of a DDS called full insensitivity syndrome to the arrogants.
Katie has developed female characteristics because of the disagreement of her drug receptors.
She's got a vagina, but it's not an alien or an oxygen.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at Pennsylvania University.
Although she is stressful, she hopes to have children through the intermission of adoption or portged mothers.
“ The law leaves a certain length to the parents that they should not take fatal decisions, ” says Baratz.
This allows them the time to make some tests and understand them, and a time before writing “man ” or“ female. ”
So, it's okay – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and benefits of the pleasure of being parent.
You don't have to precipite you for a chirurgical intervention that is irreversible.
“This makes children in the heart of the decision and enhances the feeling of adultery that motivates parents because they are afraid to do what they need,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels more in the ice – and it's something terrible.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
Letta trusted in the long-term of its government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judges that his Government will take place until 2015, although the strong tensions between the left and the right in the context of coalition to the approach of the vote of the Senat to choose Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.

Report : Obama campaign considered to fall Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest advisers of President Barack Obama have invised, in the greatest secret, to replace the Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most marked event in the very expected book of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book to appear and told Jewish evening that the neighborhoods of the President had brought the "flow works in groups and samples at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's evelopment could help Obama in view of his selection while his hopes were moved.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of high responsible for the campaign and the House of Blanche, to know the old Secretary-General of the Bill-Blanche Daley House, in view of what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by the Old Secretary of Clinton could have on the scrutin.
The possibility of a switch is a secret that has been maintained in the CG campaign of Chicago and within the Oil Office.
Only a half-douzaine of nearby advisers of the President – including Daley, the old captain of the campaign of Obama Jim Messina and the old counselors in the House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was in the study.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley has sent the charge to replace Biden, although their “extreme personal links” before finally decided to change when the numbers showed that Clinton on the president list would not just improve Obama's success.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had effectively advised to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I had considered a series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley to the journal.
Remember that the President was not in the form of this time, so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the exam of "concerte", Martin indicated to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the revolution campaign had a lot of investment to find whether the change would be beneficial in the scrutin.
“The campaigns don't pay much money to sandwiches and discussion groups as if they are seriously considered to take measures,” said Martin on AC360.
However, we don't know whether Obama was at the current that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said about the CNN he asked Daley if his boss was at the event of an accidental removal.
Although Daley said that he didn't think that the President "he was in the present" of an eventual change, the old Secretary-General agreed that he was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" was not definitively responding to the question of knowing whether the political supply had arrived on the Obama office.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama didn't know that the exhibition of Biden of the presidential list was examined.
"That may be," said Martin.
Do you have a fluo glass?
A British companier created the first fluorescent glass in the world based on medicine.
Charlie Francis took part of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light collection.
He had the idea after reading a study on medicines and convinced Chinese scientists to re-create chemically the brilliant protein.
The glass crom reacts with the language by increaseing the protein pH to make it brilliant.
Chris explains that, since the glass cry begins to get it when it reacts to the smoke of the mouth, more we laugh, more it becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the glass company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're not only at the beginning of production terms, and 2 g of this cost about about 200 £."
The protein we use in the glass react with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth repairs the protein, the pH level increases and the glass will be lighting.
We tested it during the last months, and it seemed necessary to share it with all at the time of Holween because she gives an extraordinary effect.
It's probably the dearest glass I've created because the lightness of the media is four times more precious than the gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 £.
But she's got a good guest!
The company on the experimental start of Charlie, based on Bristol, is known for his inhabituous glass parfums such as the beer, the wheel, the bird and the golden shelf.
But his next creation still announces more ambitional.
He added: “I would really want to develop an invisible glass. ”
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by glass cristalls that constitute the glass cross, but I think I will find a way to happen.
The glass uses the fluorescent properties of the medicine synthesis by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed is dead during a taxi session
The song of Lou Reed was dead when he made tachi exercises, she discovered his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the Regional Journal "East Hampton Star" and destined to the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist was deceived last Sunday, at 71 years old.
"He was dead tomorrow morning, while he looked at the trees and did the 21th moving taxi, with his musician hands that flow the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The song's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to make him out of the hospital and to bring him to their house of Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have past a lot of time here last years.
And even if we are citizens, it's our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on pain and beauty of the world will bring to many people the wonderful joy of living that he had," added.
Lou Reed went up in May last.
Halloween 2013 : in numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bonbons, to get us sleeping later and to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I became more painter.
These two years ago, I didn't distribute a single bonbon and I will certainly not do it anymore this year.
But the states show that I'm the galaxy sheep when we talk about Halloween.
Most of the Americans – 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year, expensing a total of 6,9 MD$ in bonbons, devils and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I expect with impatientness at every Holiween feast, these are the tenders.
The debts should be represented 1,2 Md$ for 6,9 billion expenditure, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimated objects are worried.
Women have no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carots.
For men, I expect to see many zombies, through the TV series The Walking Dead, and I think the men of Daft Punk's space will be found among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most searched desires are zombies, Batman, pirates and sorciers.
I think it's not bad to stay traditional.
We disappeared our dogs last year and, in my great amazing, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will pay 330 M$ for animals this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it's bullshit, we don't have funny.
The Americans will spend $1,9 Md$ in bonbons this year, according to the Nillen Captain.
This represents about 272 million kg bars of Hershey, successes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a super new new for 41 million children who are going to chase the bonbons in their neighborhood, according to the American department of the Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, don't tell us of history, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Mai bonbons are the only thing we don't want to eat; and although about 16 million kg is sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grain.
It's a mystery that I'm not yet come to earn.
Nothing is more representative in Holwayen than the houses who are hunted.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a true prison), "Houl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1200 homes who are officially recognized in the United States, which generated about 500 million recettes, according to the United States Haunts, and that includes these wonderful photos of you in order to put you up on that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on whom a guy you love a comment of the "happy head" style.
Finally, we're talking about citrouilles.
Charlie Brown presented us The Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a cytrum in the form of lantern, it's like to decorate a Noël tree - it's something we're doing since we're all small.
Happy for us, the "kind tendency" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us took these powers and didn't sit inside.
This year, the Americans will pay about $106 in citrus, according to the U.S. Census Office.
The Latin citrouilles that fletting suddenly on the porch of your house were probably from Illinois, where 542 million citrouils have been cultivated this year.
If you are looking for more comments, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, California, and try to sculp their citrulle of 922 kg.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create inside a deficiency structure ("bad bank") with 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most risked active, measured to delay his relations with London and to accelerate its reputation.

Pumpers have been called to save a lost chat after being stayed up to 15 m above the ground on an instable corner in a carrier
Ruby, a cocker Spanish, was scared after a accident of the road without gravity
She was repeated three days later by a person who passed his dog in the carrier
Pumpers are come down in memory of the falseness to get the dog and save it from a certain death
A chiot had the chance to escape the worst after the bombers were called to get it in all security while he was because at 15 m above the ground on the instable sail of a false.
Ruby, a cocker spending 9 months, was scared after an accident of the Sunday travel afternoon and survived for three days before he was saved in a merchandise carrier.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the carrier of Flappit in Denholme, in West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thank the fire and safe Service of West Yorkshire.
They were looking for disesperately for their lost dog and started a call on social network sites after she was lost in the carrier after an accident without severity.
At 14h15 Mercedes, a person at the aggregated view that passed through his dog repeated Ruby on a corner in the carrier, coined at 15 m above the sun.
A team of technical safeguard team of the Cleckheaton bombers was running on the sites and went down to save Ruby using a citizen for animals to transport it up to the false.
The specialist of technical safeguards Andy Clayton said: “It was in a previous situation.”
She was in the middle of the false, at 15 m of the summet and 15 m of the sun.
She wasn't absolutely moved during the saving – she was green.
But she's okay now.
She's eaten bitches later.
It was a very inhabitable call.
It's incredible that someone marked the dog.
The specialist of the technical safeguard Peter Lau said: "Ruby has had a lot of chance to get out of it."
She could be seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was led to the veterinary for a control; its general state was satisfied, raised by the dehydration and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified to watch the safeguards."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprised to have it again in the arms.
The veterinary said that if she was too excited and that she was missing, she would probably fall.
The bombers were cutting.
What they did was really courageous.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: “We were afraid she fell but she didn't move.”
The bombers were great.
I don't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never dropped Katy Perry when she was 18.
During a treatment in an Australian radio emission this week, the pop star stated that she was chorist on Jagger's song of Old Habits Die Hard in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained: “He dropped me when I was 18. ”
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very happy."
In a Jewish statement, a representative of Jagger, 70 years old, said that he “no category has done progress in Katy Perry”.
The representative added: "It may be a confusion with someone else."

Pekin with the cause of an Islamic Turkmenian movement
"The coulse support to the attention has come from the Islamic Movement of East Turkey based on Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese Security Board on a chain of Hong Kong TV, according to a video playing online on the night on a web site.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), expressed in Tachkent in a official visit in Uzbekistan.
It is the first time a Chinese responsible designs a special organization after the lunch warning.
According to the Chinese police, three Ouighours of the same family to the Muslim dominant region of Xinjiang, the border of several countries of Central Asia, precipite their car car loaded of essential bidons against the entrance of the City prohibited in Pekin, in a suicide attack that made two dead and 40 wounded.
The car driver, his wife and his mother lost in the car's fire.
The Etim, who declares to fight for the independence of the East Turkey, an old name of Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations held in Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic difficulties in Xinjiang, but its real influence is in doubt by several experts.
George Kerevan: The exclamation of Europe gives the choice to the Scotland
One another day, another worried story of independentity.
This time, we prevent that an independent Ecosse would have to join the European free circulation area to be accessible to the EU.
And here we hear the story of control of passports in Berwick and a barbered son border in Hadrien's wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's journal has indicated the economic events of a greater freedom of circulation with the rest of Europe, it does not appear in the large titles (and it was to prevent).
Nobody said that the EU Member States had a large part of their time to turn their formal rules when they were arranged.
Since the Ecosse is not part of the Schengen space for this time, an uncontinuous non-respect of rules would be a small conceivement that Brussels could offer in contrast all that she wants to get from Ecossais.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story as old as she is now fixed: I've heard for the first time the bobard according to that "independence means the control of passports" is more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten a interesting point in this interpretation of an old poor account.
Why should an independent Ecosse follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why to switch London's game against that of Brussels, in particular now?
This is the real presentity on Europe: the great plan for the continuing universe of Europe is definitively at the dead point.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Over Europe, the parties who oppose the EU or soldiers for the Euro's evacuation as a common devise, win from the land.
Even in Germany, the European Alternative Party for Germany, based only this year and came from no part, collected about five million votes in federal elections of September, and exited the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our democracy liberals) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition on the draft creation of a Federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a tour.
The extérieure imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the basic carcake on national economys through the aim of access to the unique monetary, has conducted many people to think that the European Project has been too far.
The euro's crisis has no great challenge to see with national governments recording excessive budgetary deficits – it was only true for Greece.
The European system has increased its members of the change rates favorable to German exporters – what German political men want to keep.
Without the possibility of an assessment of the national deviation, the South Europe countries find a problem of intrinsic productivity in respect of Germany.
The only recommendation is to make shadows in the salaries and public expenditures – encouraged by Berlin.
Besides current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deepest disease related to production in Europe.
Following the energy policies imposed by Brussels – which is a reason to subvention the French and German society of the consumer's energy sector for the cost of the consumer – the European industry pais twice more for electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.
It is an incompatible relief in costs, as we have already seen it in Grangamouth.
All salary yellows in the world will not exceed the European petrochimical industry to be penalized by a good US squist gas.
Thus, the Green Revolution, in particular in France, is one of the great men in the EU.
After the war, the French political election considered the EU as a way to control German and to put Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.
But Berlin has no longer needed Paris as a passport of his political legislation and has set his own economic policy in Europe, laiding the French economy in a bad way.
Results: the right extreme part of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, came to bring a crucial election, sending socialists to the third place.
The National Front is then the most popular part in France with 24% of sufferings – an appropriate advertising for the British Working Party that reminds him that it cannot go from the principle that a right science will automatically prefer to the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity at the French white work class?
She wants to use European elections of the next year to create a single and anti-European anti-monae block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make good figures to these elections, what is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think, very soon, the unique anti-European and anti-moneous feelings in Europe will be united and ended by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will seem more like "The United Nations (Sovereigners)" freely privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economys would be able to maintain the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own debt.
I hope that the United Kingdom takes its distances in relation to this project, and I hope he will do the eyes weak in the United States.
However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific let us think that the Great Britain will be taken into account in Atlantic.
And the Scotland, all of this?
We can decide to be a region of the small English (privately).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I think the Economic may agree with a more free European agreement as we keep our own debt.
Cooperation with other countries in similar views would be easier in a non-federal United Nations European.
If not, we should follow Norway and keep our economic independentness.
The SNP Government of Ecosia is – and it is to note – the anti-austernal political movement that has been the best success in Europe, since he has reported a spectacular majority based on its opposition on the proposed dark cups (and implemented) by the Conservation of the Working Team, Alistair Darling, and the Conservatory/Liberal Democrate Coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for the Ecosse to vote for independentity if it is to accept the extérieure imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Pubert : Before
Studies show that young African and Spanish girls have tends to achieve the age of puberty before the young white girls.
Physical changes does not mean that puberty is imminente
Nothing proves only hormones or only other chemical substances are responsible
Experts think that obedience epidemia could be a declarer of the previous puberty
The trend to a previous puberty is not also pronounced in the boys
The old CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialised journalist in family and health issues in the child.
A mother should be worried if her daughter's pubs and pubs are starting to buy 7 or 8 years?
During the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which was held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endoncrinologue, explained that these preceding physical changes are sufficiently short among the young Americans and represent a new standard.
“ I have a lot of time to raise parents – in general, it does not indicate a quick development to the full of puberty, ” said Kaplowitz.
The clear signs of development, such as the bourgenment of the seeds, the pools under arms and in the pub area and the body haters, appear to be more early in the girls.
But there was only a lot of progress from the first rules in the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 years and half, while it was 12 years three quarters in 1970.
“ Once the poitrine began to develop, it has to be at least two or three years before the first rules appear, ” said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with this Common Problem."
The time is the most precise test to know how the puberty will develop.
There is a discussion about the real appearance of the puberty, but it is considered "precoce" when the development of the poetrine comes with a sudden growth before 8 years.
In most cases, the relaxed development or stops – it is something that a pediater can follow nearly.
A faster development can justify tests made by an endocrinologue to evacuate several problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to stop the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: a premature age of bones who can fresh growth and a small size of adults.
Medical and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on child age, development rate, growth and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of medicines but recognizes that “the fact of controling the puberty can take some kind of behavior and feelings for young girls to be different from others. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents don't just want their very young girls to have their rules.
“ They fear the risk of growth or even the way they will handle hygiene issues, ” says Kaplowitz.
“ It was a choc, ” reminded a woman who had her first rules at 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we were talking about rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She's gone out of the exploited school, and it's crazy to be the first of her friends.
There are many teories ported to the knowledge of the public on the causes of the previous puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory in which the hormones contained in the lake or other foods, chemical products presented in the environment or the sexual messages that were carried out by media are responsible.
The boys, like the girls, get their puberty early.
Caplowitz indicates that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemia of obsession.
He participated in a study carried out about 6 to 9 years old girls who lied the percentage of grass massage at the fulfillment of the puberty.
Other discovery support this conclusion, but there are many other influenced factors.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls have tends to achieve the age of puberty before the young white girls.
There are several explanations.
In the world scale, the primary puberty mechanisms seem to be affected by all, economic conditions on climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although the boys had pools on the face and in the youngest area, the tendency to a real puberty is not just pronounced in the girls.
Other doctors participating in the Conference of the AAP have encouraged the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and pubian pool is current, even in foods and entire.
“We must be careful about how we identify the real apparatus of the puberty, ” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the hospital for children of Goryeb in Morristown in New Jersey.
Parents should not be hospitable to ask the advice of their pioneer to know how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean to have a conversation as soon as the proposed, ” explains Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
The girls whose puberty is early have to be safe on the fact that, even when it happens early, the process becomes part of life.
Honorship to the people of the brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" brothers Coen, Grand Price of the last Festival of Cannes, is a nostalgic and drunk film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the music that started just to say, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography came to make a retrospect in the French Cinematheca, had broken the gold Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unless you can build Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen, they have thrown their development on the quantity of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the planetary star Po Justin Timberlake.
In this blown film of humor where music is a central person and the singers interpreted directly, Oscar Isaac becomes a musician and singer of people fulfilled, while Timberlake, his friend in the movie, leaves the pop for music with a popular jubilee.
With Carey Mulligan, she left the rich attorneys of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the greatest" for less releasing clothes, a dark voice when she sings, but the juron debited to the miraillet when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" reports on a week the pains of a singer who doesn't come to perish and smile with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements at the upper feet in studies.
Without residence, he makes the turn of his friends who want to receive it.
A documentary air
"Their relationship with success is tortured, it's what we interested in: a misfortune, a guy who's not here at a good time, not carrier but intelligence, with a self-destructor behavior," said the press Ethan Coen, running with his brother Joel of many Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis doesn't exist, the two artists of music people have built their story on true personalities of the time like the musician people Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the event of Greenwich village, this room of New York called "the spectrum of the artist of music people who would generate international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentary rolls, an invaded music label of 33T invested by an ancient secretary, musical choices of the time and cafes where the songs were produced.
Brothers Coen's magic still works in integrating a personnage drill that passes through the film permanently: a beautiful round chat at cracking look, Llewyn Davis' strong company.
Asked on how he made his personality, the actor and song Justin Timberlake had mentioned that "grand in Tennessee, bailed by the blue and the country."
"My first music reads were given to me by my grandfather who learned to play the guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the job is necessary to "respect as good", "the haard can also launch the carrier of someone" and "for more today."
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromise on his music, the star pop explains that in a carrier, "the most important is not let us be confronted with all that we can stop expressing."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of SAS, is dead.
He'll never know the word retracted.
The phenomenon of the French editing, Gérard de Villiers, deceived at 83 years, just published his 200 SAS, "La Vengeance of Kremlin."
In February, the New York Times consisted of it as "the author of Spionnage Romans who knew it too much."
It came to pass ten days in Afghanistan, the teater of 198 and 199 works in the celebration of the series of spy Romans.
Fishingly decreased by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved during this travel with a deambulator.
And before Afghanistan, he was also divided in Libya, Russia, Libano and Mali.
With four SAS published by year, Gerard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, he assessed to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS to Istanbul", the first series, about half century.
"Sans double between 120 and 150 million all confused countries," he progressed in March last.
His Birman chat on the genoux, in his large apartment of Foch's Avenue's Avenue Foch to two steps from the Triomphe Arch, the painful eye under his white hair, quoted some languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russia, Greek, Japanese, or Korean.
"Sans count the pirate editions," added he, designing a board of books on the low table between bronces or ivres reported from 130 arpent countries to locate its Romans.
For the price of a cigarette packet, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman to the pregnant potter, taking a gun or a shooter.
Inside, its Serious Highness (SAS) prince Malko Linge, desolate Australian aristocrate and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the Family Chamber's reparations, starts to all the wicked people of the earth, communists of 70 and 80 years, then Jihadists from 90 years.
In each book, the same receipt: a large dose of geopolitic and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zeste of violence and torture.
"I have never had the presence of being a literary author," explained Gerard of Villiers.
I am considered as a counter who wrote to distrate people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "come the big reporters of before war, Albert London, who went on and returned with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS said, "Do a genius of geopolitic sheet."
"I'm permanently my documents (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before you go," added Gerard de Villiers.
Instead, I meet journalists, including the AFP, diplomates, people of the services I know for some of the 20 or 30 years.
In fact, the number of his SAS are often premonitors: thus, a month before an order center of the Syrian regime who killed several high responsibilities, he spoke the story in the "The Road of Dames".
In the "The Fous of Bengazi," it was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the CIA in this city, the burden of the Libyan Revolution.
In 1980, he put the homicide of the President of Egypt Anouar El-Sadate in the "The Court Complot", a year before the attention.
In October 2012, in Bamako, he reported the columns of 4X4 Jihadists based on the Malean capital.
I'm not convinced, I'm defending Gerard of Villiers, I'm just doing hypotheses from the country I know well and, in time, some of my hypotheses are realized.
After these travels in various areas, he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM to margarita from 1976 "with all the parts have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the style.
At the walls of his office are across AK-47 assault fuels, arrotic photos and photos of the author with African war managers.
Regularly equipped for macchism by female languages and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers exceeded these accusations in two phrases.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, smart and courageous women.
I've always been busy in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all the heroes, has no age."
He won't die and will not go back.
Not more than me.
Airports want about the width of the seats while large commands are in game
The discussion is rare between the large aircraft constructions on the width of the tourist class on the long-courriers flights, opening the path to a lovely confrontation in Dubai Airlines, which has been located in this month.
The conflict is on the width of the seats proposed on the long-currer flows for the pasts of the Economic class – which are not always the most cursed by Airbus and Boeing Co, but is essential to increase efficiency profits in the last devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the air industry to place a standard seting a seat size of at least 18 pounds (45,72 cm) in economic classs, but its large American rival Boeing states that it should be for air companies to decide.
The differences claimed that the aircrafts sought to sell more versions of their long-currer aircrafts, expecting even a record of commands during the event that will be developed from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be prepared behind the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic reward of the section of mini-jumbo.
Boeing states that his reviewed "777X" can be achieved in economic class 406 persons in more than 17 pieces of wide, and will be set with 10 seats per range.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 persons in a 18-year-old range of ranges of 9.
Aeronautic guarantees often change technical issues by makeing publicity in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before Dubai Airport, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 commands.
Recently, we could have considered what could be the beginning of a new public war with the presentation to a photo finances showing three persons against each other at the restaurant, titled “Do you accept that?”
“ Boeing proposes long-currer flows in more extreme seats than in regional turbo-propulsors,” stated John Leahy, Airbus commercial director.
As food habits change, people grow, but the seats in the air are not rarely changed.
Through the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing's 747 jumbo defined the modern-e-mail travel, and the centuries turning, the average rate of the America's average of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 %, according to the data of the American Health Department.
The middle-American size of the XXI century is 39,7 pounds, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival is approached to a seat concept dated from 1950, when the circuit of the camera freshly baptized "jet set" was more extreme.
Airbus adds that she has ordered a study that indicates that a additional bit of the level of the seats would improve the quality of 53 % of the dream.
Boeing consists of Airbus' numbers in respect of the width of the seats and indicates that it is not to builders to decide in the way the air companies equilibrate the price of ballets and equipment.
It also says that the study shows that the experience in cabin is not only depending on the width of the seats.
“It is really to make surprise to air companies and to allow them to do what they think to do for their activities, ” says Kent Craver, supporting the passenger satisfaction in Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what will allow them to be rent.
They know their business better than anyone.
For travellers, it is more to have a certain freedom of movement, but for the providers, it is more than a question that could affect their results.
Following the discussion, a course is hidden to airline commands for a quantity estimated at least 700 MD$ for the market price in the future decades, enough to pay the balance of American and European exports.
As Reuters showed it for the first time in July, the setting of seats is exactly what foods the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing offers both a reward by seat in their last long-curred bimotors models 20% above the leader of the market in this section, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performances announced by Boeing depend on the comparison between 777X set with 10 seeds per range and a 777 original model set in ranges of 9.
The wine in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device set with 10 seats per range currently in service.
"Boeing does this to make more seats and make its more competitive aircrafts in relation to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passager to the European Airbus airport.
On the other hand, analyzers say that the cabines set with 10 seeds by range in 777 existings suggest that many passors are going to go for a more deep setup, which can go to park with less favorite tariffs.
"A lower width of 18 pieces would be perfect for pasts, but the reality is that Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert in the officers of Mary Kirby, founder and editorial in Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but propose a catalog of providers among whom air companies must choose.
Aeroplane vendors who make the world tour even bring with them a metro to check the competitive settings.
In order to propose comfortable equipment, all constructors also offer airlines with strong density settings to low-cost airports and regional travels.
Airbus offers a A350 set with 10 seats per range but indicates that he hasn't seen it yet.
Before recently, Airbus underlined the need of greater personalization of the cabiners by offering largest seats on certain of its aircrafts.
Without the support of the only other large modern equipment designer, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the air industry in order to set a size standard for the obsessive seats, but that it could forget the vessel vague of 777X.
The Oracle Actioners who are irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle's Actioners voted against the proposal of remuneration for the founder and Director General Larry Ellison in view of the financial performances of his group.
The vote is not contradicted but comes to explore the image of Larry Ellison, the third worldwide force just along the victory of his ship to the Coupe of America.
The billionary is still 25% of the capital of the software group that he has co-funded for 40 years ago.
The last year, Ellison had voted a negative vote on his remuneration.
The Boss of Oracle renewed a bonus of $1,2 million for the exercise 2013 closed in May 2013 because of the bad performances of the group, which missed its growth objectives, but he tried about 77 million dollars linked to stock options.

The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the happiness of fume
Scientifics have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that we're going to fuel a cigarette.
A only dose of vaccin could be protected by the mouses from the Nikotin dependence.
Other tests are necessary before starting the tests on human beings, but Professor Ronald Cristal of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraged.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccinal strategy can help millions of fumers who have tried to stop, exceeding all the methods available on the market today, but discovering that their addition is sufficiently strong to overcome these different approaches, ” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccin contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the necessary genetic information to conceal anti-nicotine anti-bodies.
The virus infects selectively the cells of the fuel, which then begins to produce a regular flux of anticorps.
Anticorps track all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they get the brain, which stops the fumure to have its dose of nicotine.
In tests, the vaccineous mouses that were then given by nikotin have continued their activities normally.
But the mouses that were not vaccined were “behaveed, ” said the researchers, signing that nikotina had achieved their brain.
Experiences are described in the Revision of Translational Medical Science.
The previous vaccins against the tabak were ineffective because they had antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so often so that anticorps levels remain high that they were too nice and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccin should be very low because it transformas the cells of the fuel in anticorps.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human use vaccine was completely safe, we could be able to administrate it to children before they were trying to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to Nicotine.
But it is most likely that it is used by fumers who want to stop fums.
"They will know that if they start to fum, they will not be happy because of an anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habits," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but reported that more approached research needed.
The chief of Pakistan Taliban killed by a drone
Hakimullah Mehsud, the chief of the Pakistan Taliban movement, was killed in a battle of an American soldier drone in Pakistan, was learned at security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud was announced for several times by the past.

Tripodi is not influenced by Obeid
The Old Working Ministry of New Galles of South Joe Tripodi will make an investigation of the anti-corruption regulator of the State.
The ancient Ministry of New Galles of South Joe Tripodi has noted to have changed the trade ball policy on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, which had interests hidden in three goods located in the government controlled.
Vendredi, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded his research to know if Mr. Obeid had pressed several state ministers to renew its balls in Circular Quay, where Obeids have two restaurants and a coffee after their expiration in August 2005, without a call of offers.
She then investigates the allégations that Mr. Tripodi was at the time of the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these properties, following the witness of the ancient Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Jewish.
During the periods of discussions in 2005, the Government pressed the boards to make an offer call.
The locators were against and also wanted to be longer.
In 2009, the balls on Cyrcular Quay companies, related to Obeid at about 2,5 billion per year, have been renewed without offering.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of February 2006 to November 2009, was on the favorable department of the offer calls.
But he would have changed his policy to Mr. Obeid's request, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, claimed a change of the Government policy on the board.
The telephonical conversation training in the ICAC showed calls past August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high officer who had arrived in the Minister of Ports after he had worked under the orders of Mr Obeid in the Ministry of Federation.
“ The issue discussed during these telephone discussions was the development of trade policy?", asked the Commissioner advised Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“ No, ” said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, it wasn't about that.
In all cases, not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israelian war aircraft targets Syria, states a responsible
Israelian war flys have achieved a target in the Syrian Portary city of Latakia Jeudi night, confirms a military responsible for Fox News.

Foreign workers in a visa 457 could have a test “authenticity”
The Government is currently studying the opportunity to ensure a “authenticity” test for foreign workers with a visa 457 while he considers expanding the repression measures.
The test, if it is adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criteria to prevent visa 457 to be used to build non-qualified posts or as a declined way to make his family and his friends in Australia.
A work document of the Government has been devoted today, while Maxine McKew denied the Government talking about strangers, saying that he could offend the neighborhood of Australia.
"The missing statements on the "foreigners returning to the file" and "employment for the Australians first" are an insufficient return at the time when syndicates requested a protectioned work market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this means that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries of the region see it as a shooting of this historical artefact.
The work document has been stated of 12 measures which were previously considered by the ancient Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Ministry of the Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet high responsibilities to discuss the trafic of human beings, has implemented five recommended changes, and others are in the test.
If the criteria “authentication” was adopted, a visa demander could be controlled to know "if the offer of employment is authentic in the case of the candidate is a relationship or personal partner of the owner or of the person concerned in the company who sponsorizes it."
The companies may also be able to declare the number of visa detenants of 457 after some of them, with the intention of sponsoriating a small number of workers, have actually been employed for hundreds.
At least, a sri-lankais asylum demander of 35 years would be dead from a heart crisis after he arrived on a ship transporting from asylums to Christmas Island this week.
The son of the man, a nine-year-old son, went with him in Australia and found some comfort since his father's death came to a adult counsel that was also at the border.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital of Christmas Island, where he was deceived.
A study destined to multiply the benefits of the HS2 ferroviary project for the Ecosia was launched by the British Government.
The work held by HS2 Ltd allows you to think that the large speed services to Scotland and the North of England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Ministry of Barone Transports Kramer stated that the project would “assemble the United Kingdom. ”
The Education Minister of Transports, Keith Brown said "excited" to the idea of working with the British Government on the project.
The Phase 1 will be carried on a new ferry line in a large speed between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimative cost of the construction of a large speed connection between London and the north of England, passed from 32,7 Md £ to 42,6 Md£.
The British Government, which is in parking with Transport Scotland, requested HS2 Ltd to study the strength of the ferroviary capacity and improvement of the period of traits for North England and Ecosia.
This should include the possibility of traveling periods between Glasgow and Edimburg for three hours to more.
The baron Kramer stated: “Our objective for HS2 takes on a real national network that will close the United Kingdom and its cities.”
We put the HS2 project because the benefits that are present are great.
Without him, we are compared with a problem of capacity of our ferroviary network.
But it is also to develop connectibility between the 18 large Britain cities, including Glasgow and Edimburg, to be better than HS2.
The British State Secretary for Ecosia, Alistair Carmichael, added: “The announcement of today is a good news for the Ecosse.”
For the school government, Keith Brown called Mr Carmichael to support the inclusion of the Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The train of great speed has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to the Ecosia, but it also brings the economic rate of the Ecosia in the global aircraft network to large speed in all the United Kingdom.
"We therefore are excited to the idea of working in partnership with the British Government to examine the options to bring the train-free train network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and completing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Ecossais government is already planning.
“I am improper to read the report of exam with the British Ministry in the next year, and then we will decide together the next steps.”
The rules relating to the use of electronic equipment on border are now in force in Australia
Australian aircrafts should continue to evacuate their tablets and smartphones during the decolling and aircraft, although the host of the United States is intended to apply the regulation on electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration has left the open door to American transporters for a change of their procedures so that passors can read electronic books, view videos, or play games on their devices during the critical flight phases in order to be in the mode "aeroplane".
Travellers can already do it during the largest part of the flight, but many people are worthy of not access to their electronic books during the decolation and aircraft.
Australian transporters examine the decision that the American transporters require a important job to respect the requirements, but they have not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was considered the announcement but submitted that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aeroplane,” said.
The question is a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security permanently and passors to respect the safety consigns given by the members of the equipment.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA of her intention to expand the use of its divorce system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change but stated that she would follow the regulator.
“We would prefer to take a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the Wi-Fi-Technology Diversation system) on our flights,” indicated a port speaker.
Qantas stated that she respected the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, the electronic devices cannot be used during the decolation and the aircraft, and we do not have the intention to change this," she said.
The decision of the FAA is applied to American air companys.
However, we are still interested by regulatory developments that could benefit to the passors, and we will consider the decision of the FAA and the reasons of this.
For American transporters, the effect of the decision will be made by a air company to the other and will depend on the age of their flow.
Travellers should demonstrate that their aircrafts can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manual, training equipment, manual bathroom transport programs and consigns provided to travellers.
“ Since a air company checked the tolerance of her float, it can allow passors to use light-portable loading devices, such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones to all heights, ” said the FAA.
In rare cases of low-visibility, the equipment will request passors to exit their devices during the aircraft.
The group also recommended that the most severe devices should be raised in all security under seats or upper parts during the decolation and aircraft.

“ My husband and I are coming to buy a house, so all my money is gone inside, ” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she won $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as a administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family revenue is not enough, she said.
In fact, the request is such in some parts of South-East Asia – where the achievement of the increased measures – that ValueMax, where it has done its transaction, has become the third of the costs to be introduced in the burg of Singapore.
In the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga, it is not only a fast way to get from the liquid money – 1 300 dollars from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it's almost so good market as well as non-assured banking preparations.
In general, Singapur's guarantee offers an annual interest rate of 17 %, just above 15,4 % offered by the United States Overseas Bank, a local fund bathroom with a smooth in the same trade center.
However, the guarantee offerers have the better to not request solve or payment evidence, and they can discharge the prices faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people through the region turn to guarantee priests while families feel the pressure of the increase of the cost of life and the overcome of debts and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the world's financial crisis, and the good market credit feeded by a too laxistic monetary policy in advanced economics, the families of low and medium income are turned to the gas offers to fulfil the difference while their economys know a relax.
This week, the Standard & Poor's Notation Agency has cited the growing detention of minas, mainly deceived the highest of hypothecarian prices, as a risk factor for the solution of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapur would record the final ratio of inlands/products ratio.
Malaysia has arrived in the list with 80% of the PIB, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of delay of consumers in Thailand, which has exposed at least this week of a technical recession.
Jeudi, data have shown a weakness of exports and a relaxation of the demand of consumers.
“The balance is that with the height of costs, people in the middle or bottom [the salary scale] seek to complete their income as they can, ” says Song Sang Wun, an economist in the CIMB, a malesian bank.
The historically high prices of gold during the past two years have made people impressed to gain their personal effects to touch the value in kinds of their beauty.
In Singapore, about 70% of the articles gathered in the 200 bills of the town winning are gold.
People say: “The gold price is high, we put the chain in gold of grandma and will return to the next month. ”
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest gas packaging operator, recorded 20% of the number of customers using its boxes during the last months.
The highway is like in the sector of the gas of ValueMax, operator of the boot in Bendemeer and 15 other bottles such as this in Singapore, intended to develop not only in Malaisie neighborhood – where he has already counted four bottles – but also outside Asia, said yes Lee Ching, his general director.
The company will finance them by using 60% of the 66 M$ of Singapur that she has raised up this week during its introduction to Singapore's Burs.
While some decreased rate offers the criteria for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Ja indicates that the gain offers not only less higher than other priests, but that it does not increase directly the debt.
“The customers hypothetic goods that have already, and the fact that they can monet their personal goods does not increase the treatment of mistakes, ” she said.
The gain is better in socially accepted as a means to get a short-term financial finance.
Persons who are going to be at the guarantees are not only those who have financial problems.

325 M$ Safety Plan destined to Tasmania Health System
The federal Government maintains that the safeguard plan of 325 M$ destined to the vacational health system is aware of strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State will not gather the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth currently takes "urgent measures" to end a crisis caused by the age of the population of insulary state, the high level of chronic diseases and system contrasts.
Financing, proposed for four years, was decided after consultations of the Government with the independent Deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government proposed an urgent safeguard plan that, according to us, will regulate the unique difficulties with which the State is confronted," said Mrs. Plibersek today.
The plan of 325 M$ includes a campaign of 31 M$ for non-urgent chirurgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, in particular in the area of ortopediacy and cataract, will help to raise the late.
Financial funds are also provided in Hobart and Launceton, the best outcome, the training of medical frameworks, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medicinal products systems in local hospitals.
“ These investments respond to the idea of which, according to the first-line clinics, it is the best way to monitor the Tasmania Health System,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Ministry stated that the Government of Tasmania would be compared to a strict regulation for the preparation of reports and accounts.
The State should maintain the current financial levels to receive the money of the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where the additional funds are extended.
A composed committee of three persons will be constituted to ensure that the State provides the most effective and effectively possible services.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the 325 M$ will not be accounted for high-chose “because they are followed by a real reform that allows us to consolidate the public health system of Tasmania”.
However, he welcomed the Government by responding to the urgent assistance request that he had submitted to the Prime Minister in Mai.
"I hope that the Federal Aid Plan will be greatly contributed to remove the public health system of Tasmania from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-urgent procedures will be increasingly inverted.
But Peter Dutton's heavy opposition door speaker thinks that the announcement of today is a "function solution".
"The reason why we are here is that the workshop government of the State has removed 430 m from its health system," he stated on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the State that takes about a half-billion dollars and the Commonwealth that takes $300, and suggest that it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars of the safeguard plan will be paid in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the Roman of Denis Diderot takes a remarkable artistic direction and a minute reconstitution of time, but it is also more working than it should be.

The conscious solemnity of the report could also become a penitential for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, states the monitoring organization
The Syria has destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic munitions, the international organization of monitoring judish chemical weapons, while violent faces were rare in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents were censed to be stored.
A Syrian military group also declared Jewish that over 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of civil war in the country of nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OIAC) has arrived with a day of advance on the limit date of the
1 November established by the organisation based on The Haye ordered to destroy Damas or "inutilizable" all chemical weapons production units and machines destined to measure toxic gas and fulfil the munitions.
The achievement of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step of the ambitial calendar to destroy the chemical weapons of Damas from here from mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damas must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is thinking that the country has about 1,000 tons of products and chemical weapons, including the motard gas and the neurotoxic sarin agent.
The announcement was made when the fights made a judge in the city of Safira who, according to experts, opened a unit of chemical weapons and store sites, reported the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights based on Great Britain.
The military group, which follows the evolution of the human budget through a military network based on Syria, declared Jeudi that 120 296 people were dead.
We consider that there were 61 067 citizens, including 6 365 children.
By the Government, 29.954 members of the army forces of President Bachar el-Assad found death, 18.678 were fighters of the pro-governmental forces and 187 of the Libanian Hezbollah military men.
In the dead, it also estimated that 2 202 were deserts and some 5 375 of the opposition fighters, which were a lot of strangers.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 1000,000 people were dead in conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to escape the country because of the conflict.
The teams of El-Assad are fighting against rebels, which are many linked to Al-Qaida network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared Jeudi that there were losses of both sides, but there was no precision.
The fights underlined the importance of the dangers with which the chimical weapons inspectors are compared when they have to finish their mission, which is to discharge the Syria of its toxic arsenal in the middle of a civil war that will lose in serious periods.
A statement of the OIAC, which works in extreme cooperation with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “the now satisfied to have controlled – and see destroyed – all the critical production and machines designed to melange and complementary.”
She added that “no other inspection activities were provided for the time.”
Later in the week, the inspectors stated that they had finished the first step of the check work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damas.
They couldn't visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, they indicated inspectors.
Jeudi, the OIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, “resolved and... that the elements of the chemical weapons that they contain had been moved to other stated sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know if Safira's unit was one of the two sites that OIAC inspectors could not be visited.
The Syria has submitted a total plan of destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved in the next month by the Executive Committee of the OIAC.
“I welcome the moral force and the strength you all have proved in the framework of the most difficult mission of this organization,” said the General Director of the Organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war is mainly opposed to the Muslims rebels southern Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the section of the laouts, a chite islamic branch.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights stated that there was a strong mercred explosion in a base of air protection in the Syrian Coast Province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, has added.
Course provoked by the penalty pronounced with one of the Bali bombers
The survivors and the nearby 202 persons killed in Balli's attention in 2002 reacted with wrath to the penalty of the last conspirators to be translated to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be fueled by an execution ball.
Patek, who has been running nearly 10 years in the field of one of the most searched men in South-East Asia, has been condemned yesterday at a penalty of 20 years of prison for its role in the manufacture of explosive engines used in attentions.
It may be released for 15 years under conditional freedom.
The 45-year-old man was recognized by massage murder for attentions regarding two night boxes in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and made many wounds.
It has also been recognized by many other accusation leaders in relation to terrorism, including a vague of awareness in the churches in the entire Indonesia at Noël in 2000.
Procureurs asked a penalty for a perpetual decrease, but they could ask the man, which is called "Demolition Man" for his expert reputation of bombs, or was condemned to death.
The decision renewed penalties for June Corteen, a mother of Perth, who lost his two 39 years of age, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators about 10 years ago.
At the lame, she said that Patek should be condemned to death.
I really think he should follow the same way as the other men.
"It should be trained before the execution board," Mrs. Corteen said to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other kids, nor seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was entirely destroyed when a large bomb, loaded in a firegonet guarded outside, was explored just after 23 hours on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar when one cammass had cut a sack of two explosives at least 20 seconds ago.
He was in the coma on the next day of the watch and remained unconscious for a month, and he was threatened when he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same sort of the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – which were executed for four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been condemned before others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Over 20 years in prison after I killed 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bomb explorers to be translated in justice.
He had successfully refused to be captured for almost 10 years but finally was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the old boss of Al-Qaida, Oussam ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the process, a FBI agent declared that reports of information services had stated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore connections between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“It's not done, ” added Mrs. Corteen.
Before recently, he moved the ransom that he could cause others.
The verdict was made at the field of the 10th anniversary of the attention that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonys in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many weeping this year, ” said Mrs. Corteen.
But Patek can call his condemnation.
FAA: Air passagers then can use gadgets on the front of the aircraft (but no call with their portable phone)
Airports passengers can use their e-mail port devices for reading, working, playing games, looking films and listing from music – but not to talk about their phone – in accordance with new very expected guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But the passors should not wait for immediate changes.
The speed with which the changes will be placed by a air company to the other, the FAA Michael Huerta manager said in a press conference.
Air companies should prove the FAA that their aircraft respects the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the equipment members and rules relating to the range of devices to be conformed.
The FAA stated that she had already received plans of some aircraft companies to expand the use of electronic devices on their flights.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already submitted plans.
“ In accordance with the plan, we could apply a wide use of electronic devices very closely, ” indicated the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must exit their smartphones, tablets and other devices since the airports are closed.
They are not censused to rent them before the aircraft gets a height of 10 000 feet and that the commander gives its green fire.
Travellers are supposed to disappear their devices when the aircraft is declined before the aircraft and do not raise them until the aircraft is located.
In accordance with new directives, aircraft companies which are correctly protected from the electronic interferences may allow passors to use their devices during the decolations, aircrafts and aircrafts, the FAA stated.
Most of the new line flows and other aircrafts that have been modified to use the Wi-Fi to higher heights, should be satisfied with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight expectants, has been happy for these changes.
"When the new policy is implemented in all security, and we will work closely with transporters for this, it will be beneficial to everyone," explained Glading in a statement.
We are pregnantly happy to feel like "the room surveillance" when it is about this question.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet for surfer, change emails and SMSs or download data under 10 000 feet, said the Agency.
Travellers should put their smartphones, tablets and other vehicles in air mode.
So not even Words With Friends, the Scrabble online game that played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was cut out a lot of an American Airlines fly after he refused to exit his device while the camera was guarded at the door.
And the worst devices like the portable computers should always be cut off because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
The portable phones on the board will continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority on portable phones is the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA can exceed the prohibition on certain electronic devices during the decolation and aircraft
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Safety Board, national insurance expert on CBS News, stated that portable phones were always considered as a risk.
“The portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interferences with navigation instruments, but because we know, after the FCC, that they could suffer mobile phones if they were used, ” says Rosenker.
A industrial consultative committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended the last month that the Government allows a larger use of personal electronic devices.
The sustainable pressure on the FAA has been strengthened during the last years to apply the restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. support that there is no reason for security valid for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become universal.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passagers forget to exceed their devices, or do it freely.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interferences with navigation and communication instruments when passors carried out FM radios, the high-tech gadget of others.
The new line vehicles depend on electronic systems than the previous generations of air, but they are also designed to retain the electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Air companys allow their travellers to use the Wi-Fi to cross heights for several years.
The aircrafts changed to achieve Wi-Fi systems are also better for interferences.
The largest majority of linear aircrafts should allow more use of electronic devices in accordance with new directives, Huerta.
Electronic devices today are generally exceeding radio power transmissions as lower than the previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only minimum transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when telephone devices or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who press for the implementation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by travellers.
In 2011, the leaders of the company loaded a line of readers of Kindle e-book readers and made it flying to see if there were problems, but there was no one.
This inspired the members of the consultative Committee of the FAA’s feelings mixed about the question to know whether the use of devices are present or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd de la National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he thought that the interferences that produce devices were real, even if the risk was minimized.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only anecdotic reports of pilots that indicate that equipment can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allows pilots to request passengers to exceed their devices during the traveling instruments in low visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry has welcomed changes, calling them full sense for equipped technologies.
“We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a joyful passive experience is not incompatible with security,” said Roger Dow, President and director of the United States Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird from a North Sea Platform was left in nature
A bird, helicoptered after have been found on a petrolier platform in the north sea, was left in nature.
We made the role of water on the top of a helicopter from Aberdeen on the last month before the SPCA has been moved in his Alloa's safe center.
The Director of the Centre, Colin Seddon, said: “This role of water was probably a hivern migrant from North Europe and was found in the middle of violent winds in North Sea.”
It seems that the egg was successful to find a refuge on the petroly platform.
He added: “It was impossible to turn again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water role was healthy when he was left.
Is the European election ready to do business with the United Kingdom?
The Business for British campaign was launched in April with the promise of meeting the enterprises and determined what the creators of riches and employment want to be changed in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the largest and fullest research to the British business leaders and asked them what they thought about the Great Britain, the business and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representatives of all business sizes, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The investigation conclusions will be a surprise for many.
We discovered that the large majority of the companies soon look forward to export outside Europe, focusing on countries modernizing and developing while the EU States stay.
They want to see the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of reforming the long and hard process of European institutional architecture.
When they ask their opinion on specific policy points – from the regulation of monopols on products – most of the undertakings leaders think that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster's hands.
The unique market has occurred a general discontinuation, and the company says that the cost of Brussels Regulation is disproportioned on the benefits of the European trade area – 40 % of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European, are also agreed.
Finally, and what is further speaking, our investigation with undertaking leaders declared that an important majority wanted to see the United Kingdom to continue initiatives in order to change the Treaty and development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not in the policy.
This conclusion, which is found in all the large groups and enterprises of all sizes, shows that the world of the business is intended for a significant change that reduces the power to the United Kingdom.
The joints are higher – to change the Treaty and to represent the interests of the United Kingdom would be allowed to see 16 % of the votes for the maintenance of the EU in a reference.
The Prime Minister should not suffer a single moment: this investigation shows that the British enterprises support this plan to renegage the terms of accession to the United Kingdom to the EU.
It also shows that enterprises hope that renegation will be a significant change in the current equation of power for a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and it is more necessary to represent the interests of the British enterprises, since the euro area is attached to the path of a more extreme economic and fiscal Union.
The priority must be the employment and growth in the United Kingdom and, as the conclusions of our investigation shows it, for the companies it means to renew the accent on trade and a fundamental change of the regulatory approach of Brussels.

Alexei Miller of Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gazode is increasing a new age of gas
The beginning of the construction of South Stream Gasoc in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the Director of Gazprom.
“A historical event has been present today: the construction has started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gasoduc, the largest scale project in Europe,” explained Alexei Miller, Director of Gazprom, in a Jewish declaration.
This project is a key element of energy security of all European continents.
South Stream should be allowed to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual difference between Gazprom and its Ukraine homologic, the country through which the largest part of the Russian gas destined to Europe, increases the risk level in relation to conventional paths, adds to the Director.
Miller added that the direct joint to Bulgaria, member of the European Union, means that geopolitic risks associated with the transit countries are “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas of South Stream to a reduced target since the whole project will be served in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that the construction should be started in other countries located down here the end of the year.
The gasoc was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubes of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the greatest sea reserve of the world
The island of Pitcairn wanted to create the greatest sea reserve of the world, announced the dayday The News of Tahiti, receiving an information from Radio Australia.
This island, on the east of the Gambier Archipel (Francian Polynesia), is the last British Territory of South Pacific, at mi-chemin between the New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if it is counted to three other small islands.
He is British since his employment in 1790 by the Mutinians of the Bounty, episode of the English sea story that has given place to three Hollywoodian adaptations.
Some decades of inhabitants, in most of the mutants of Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95 per cent of the generosity of London.
The Council of the island voted to the unanimity for the creation of a sea reserve around the small archipel, or 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
An adjoint to the island's room is gone to London to ask the United Kingdom to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the Master of Pitcairn, estimates that the creation of such protected area would be the first step to more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand and by the British Government.
The creation of such marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, however, in the conditions of ensuring the monitoring, which is not the case.
There are no airports in Pitcairn, which makes impossible to base one or more aircraft on the monitoring of the area, and there are no ports where to place military monitoring ships.
With regard to France, it must have already been carried out the very costful air and maritime monitoring of five million km2 of the U.S.E.A. of France Polynesia, neighbor of Pitcairn.
The FAA applies the restrictions on the use of the electronic gadgets on the aircraft – but it will always be prohibited to pass calls on portable phones.

Life Prison for an old Chinese Vice Governor
An old vice-governator of the Province of Jilin, in the north-est of China, was condemned in the prison for corruption.
Exclude of the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused to touch more than 19 million pots-win yuans, reporting the Chinese official media.
between 1995 and 2001, the Vice-governator, who also was President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped enterprises and responsibilities to obtain contracts, prepared or promotions for money or challenges, declared the first intermediary court of Pekin on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took his functions last March, made a national priority against corruption, estimating that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the communist Party.
If the chief of the State promised that justice would be also indirect with the powerful "tigres" and with the "mouches" - the sub-alternal officials - only a pig of high rang responsibilities have been condemned, among those of the elders of the petrolier Petrochina gender.
The latest spectacular case was the oldest head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, condemned in September for corruption and abus of power after he had seen the highest functions in the state.
But the Government has never demonstrated the intention of reforming the system of fighting against corruption by creating for example a independent body of the party.
Two employees of the YMCA accused sexual attacks followed by allégations made by Jonathan Lord in an audience of the Kingdom Commission.
Two employees in the New South Wales YMCA were accused of sexual attacks against children after allégations made with Caringba's educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, when the Kingdom Commission heard of sexual abuses on children.
However, in its statement of opening before the Commission, the YMCA stated that “he had never had been to treat a sexual agression problem on children within his organization.”
The general Director Phillip Hare was asked about two businesses: a YMCA employer was accused of infringements relating to child pornography and a physical education monitor of YMCA Caringbah Hall was recognized by sexual agression on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, advocate to the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not at the second.
He also announced that the YMCA open declaration was unexpectedly underlined, “the external controls of the YMCA have been carried out and indicated that the security of children was a absolute priority for the organization.”
It was shown before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the worst seconds on four institutions in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communitys in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working in the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personal management was a failure with the Lord's recruitment and that he refused to check that the employees knew that they had to notify all violation of children ' s security policy.
Moreover in the year, Lord was condemned for sexual attacks on twelve boys during the two years he worked in YMCA.
He was condemned in a six-year prison penalty.
But Mr. Hare refused the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem for the personal to notify the Lord's missings against children's security.
The members of the personnel have witnessed that they had observed some mistakes, especially the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he keeped them privately, sitting on his neighbors, said to them that he loved them and left them to play with his portable phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was cut off by the Lord, and who had asked a training for children's protection because she was concerned about his behavior, indicated that she had found the responsibility of services to the child of YMCA Caringba, Jacqui Barnat, who would be “intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The General Director said that he refused the witnesses of the personnel according to which they were rejected to the idea of notifying these missing to their herarchical higher.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relationships they were involved with the Lord have broken their judgment, which they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his opinion before the Council of New Gales of South Southern YMCA, saying that for the organization, the learning of the “incident Jonathan Lord” should not be concerned with the "the signation" by the person, and the Council was agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign to the personnel of confidentiality agreements, less after the allégations were issued, was taken by the General Director of the YMCA loaded from services for children, Liam Whitley.
He declared that this decision was destined to avoid any contamination of the evidence elements but that it was a “except of targets” and that it was not implemented.
The YMCA of New Galles in South South was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed, to know between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
It indicated that there were “great problems” in recruitment, control, initiative, training and monitoring of personal.
The audience has been updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would have the opportunity to return to the Prime Minister, but he recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In a training last night marking the fifth anniversary of his department at the end of his mandate, the 59-year man made his opinion on various national policies.
Since his department in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr Blair was a wide exciting to discuss the British policy, restricting its comments to strangers and its special envoy of the Quatuor for the peace process in the Middle East.
When we asked him if he would like to find the office of the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would answer, according to the Evening Standard of London: "Yes, of course, but he may probably happen, so..."
When a number of experts in square demonstrations were gathered together in Cardiff to face and bring the tropees of the Year Cheval, they knew that competition would be broken.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years.
Not yet in school, and only few months after having made his first weapons, the universe and his poney Shetland Toffee have traveled during the three tours with a great facility and have rewarded the first price and left the 30 other adult competitors behind them.
The two unseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual concurrence that was departed in the Sunnybank Square Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he presented against men and women in elegant hair, he brought his boxed board a little on the side of the detonated way to make his poney Toffee age of 2 years around the track.
Fenton was held by the judges for its natural qualities of little common drying for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee in gift for his 3th birthday in March and entered from his poney Shetland every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years old, said: “Fenton and Toffee do a great two. ”
They were presented in and against everybody, but they both broke the cup in gold and the rose.
It was only the second time he'd convinced Toffee and we were amazing of joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenonical that they wanted to photograph with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebw Vale, in the south of the Gales country, follows the traces of his grandmother Sharon Howells, who participates in escape competitions since over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: "They had electricity in the air, and everyone encouraged it and approved it."
He passed through all the length of the current track and even if he seemed to be all small, he did a wonderful work.
Fenton is foolish of animals – he loves horses, tractors, and the rural world, and has two bullets of which he's busy.
In the way he started, he will certainly participate immediately in the announcement of the Cheval – and I am sure he will make a great prestation.
A port-word of the annual exposure stated: “Fenton has only three years but he knows how to drive his poney. ”
They make a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well presented and the way they split on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the poney and the dresser – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes have helped Fenton, he was very happy to go.
A Chinese journal that started a call "they will be replaced"
A Chinese journal that started a call on the first page for the release of a journalist accused divorce will be completed, states a press regulator.
The New Express based on Guangzhou published a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later adopted the television that he accepted pots-de-vin to produce history about a half-public company.
Today, the New Express has come to a “complete removal ” stated the regulator.
The "changement" order exceeds the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary research showed that the New Express, apparent to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion society between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The new Express reaction was deorganized, ” said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided to “build an administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by getting his press card. ”
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to interpret a complete replacement of New Express, and recommended he to carry out a research on the responsible persons in New Express and immediately replace the journal guide team.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the financial irregularities presumed by a cancer manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his journal published twice a call on the first page for his freedom, writeing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television chain where he was admitted to publish false history against money.
“In this case, I was near to Zoomlion and the media industry and its capacity to win public trust,” he said to the public TV network CCTV.
I've done it mainly because I've been running after the money and the celebration.
I realized my mistake.
Following the excuses of Mr. Chen, New Express published his excuses on the first page, writeing that he did not correctly check his articles.
Many important suspects have recently been made by TV.
Specialists say that persons are systematicly contradicted to make their grandfathers, although a change in the law that has been voted early in the year prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to commit himself.
Charles-de-Gaulle's Port-Avenue in "inaccessibility"
Toulon, the gateway is rare.
The fucking radioactive vampire was detected on one of the two nuclear chambers of Charles-de-Gaulle, at mid-October and when the ship was in the sea, it was "no danger for the sea," but it is not without consequences for the sea.
The Kingdom has actually come to confirm us "inaccessibility" from the ship until "midnight November", "the time to take the correct measures imposed" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, specialist of the defence ship, ensures that its teams and the Areva, retained in the Var for the occasion, "they are currently interviewed on the port. "
It's for them, among others, to change a pump on the failure.
"All is implemented to make Charles-de-Gaulle its deployment in the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Sea to ensure that "this doesn't reject nothing because of the ship's activities programme" to nuclear propulsion.
We remember that the port-avenue Charles-de-Gaulle has been achieved from a period of intermediary maintenance for six months.
He came from Toulon at half October for a training.
This, in particular, to quality the young chase pilots.
A "avarian peit", circoncised at the range of the reactor's finishing space, was then produced on the amiral ship of the French float.
According to the National Sea, the equipment was not exposed to an eventually radioactive pollution.
Since more than one year, partly, I am even being a strong disagreement from the part of the people I meet: a monstruous review of their properties, tax delution, costs of all kinds, administrative prices to end.
Bref, siphonage without limits of our pockets.
Millions of dilapided dollars could be exposed to allow a very respective taxation of those who are patients.
All money taken from force to contributions reduces their consumption freedom and contributes to their advantage.
In Shawinigan, although all major companies are closed, it is not concerned about the sustainable costs and the maintenance of the boat canadians: Deficit cultural centre, strong subvention to the Energy City, etc.
If these installations are not rewardable, we'll sell them to the private business or to demoly them.
It is also going to constaurate the expropriation of several properties to accommodate a large industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable statement to the transformation of ancient Wabasso as a kind of industrial incubator, but what cost for tax payers?
This is not the public pallers to invest in such enterprises, but also to the private sector based on the application of the consumer.
The citizens were happy to learn that the lakes in the Pacific and the Piles will continue to approve the city in potable water.
Following all industry (the large water consumptors) and the large decline of the population, water use has decreased significantly reduced all over the territory.
Without meaning of the player, the city will never miss water and severe regulation about its use might be very careful.
In summary, it is very easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I'd be happy to defend such a bill.
With more than 200 million dollars, this city is not even able to buy a style without pass by an emergency regulation.
We are handled for more than 40 years by cravates with beautiful diplomas for most, and I don't think that one of the nuts do worse.
Developing a tunnel of drugs between the United States and Mexico with its own ferry route
One of the most sophistic tunnels served for drug traffic between the United States and Mexico, containing its own lighting systems, ventilation and electric railways, has been discovered.
The United States authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophistic passments they had never seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length of about six long-term football lands, reaches traps near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area regulates non-definitive equipment, which allows easily to dissip the carried drug trucks.
The tunnel has been closed before drugs have been resorted through unpreviewed, the authorities have declared.
The authorities have set 8,5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel discovery, according to the judiciary documents.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as chauffers, were accused of marijuana and cocaine with selling intentions.
They seek a penalty of prison from 10 years to the perpetual declaration if they are condemned.
In Nogales, in Arizona, trailers explore large summer training channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important pass in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana collection in the Mexican Centre in October, taking a deficiency for drug carts that should rapidly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 bills of ferry roads that went from the cuisine of a house of Tijuana and went to two travels of San Diego.
The British police delivers a mandate of extradition in Assange
The British police today delivered a mandate of extradition to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who refused to the Equator Embassed in London and asked the political asile.
Scotland Yard stated that she had delivered a "communication advice" with the Australian around 40 years, requesting him to present a police Commissioner, adding that if he doesn't, it would be able to be arrested.
Asanga could be extracted in Sweden following sexual crime allégations, after exceeding all possible ways in accordance with the British law after the Supreme Court has invalided the call that he interviewed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
While Stockholm allows his transfer to the United States, he found a refuge at the Ecuador Embassed in London on 19 June, requesting this country of South America to the political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “lifted an advice to a man of 40 years who requested him to present a police commissioner, date and time of his choice,” said a port speaker.
He continues to ensure the conditions of his freedom under care.
Amanda refused to comment the freedom of the advice by the police.
It was afraid that he was extracted from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spionage, after devoting over 2500,000 American diplomatic chambers on the WikiLeaks website to fight secret information.
How Biomethrade is invading our lives
Finish the passwords to tackle to access your smartphone or pay your customers?
American, French or Japanese researchers preach a future where we will be recognised by the biometric captors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, adjoint director of Morpho, even "the century will be biometer."
Only the biometer will ensure the identity of a person who realizes transactions in a transnational and transnational universe as well as Internet .
The private life protection organizations confirm this commitment for biometric, but they are concerned.
Nothing that in 2011 and France, the National Commission of Information and Freedoms has authorised 774 systems of recognition of undertakings, the form of hands or the main network in companies, administrations, songs...
"All world will soon be identified, not anywhere and not anywhere," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons of such optimism, in one another, and pessimism, in others?
Biometer will support new technologies, which will make new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are digital pressures, hands around and the weaponous networks of the pawn or drops.
But each of these techniques has its contracts.
"For example, some people who work in the beton have the deeps and their debts are unable," says Philip Robin, the technical director of the identity area in Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and the verification of the weaponous network and the front of the hand suspects a volunteer and specific guest of persons.
It is at times a security - we cannot capture these data into their insufficient - and an unconvenient: the procedure must be repeated at times and then take time.
Research is therefore carried out from 20 years on other approaches, such as the recognition of face or ice (the colored part of the eye).
In view of the increased precision of smarters and calculation capacity of computers necessary for the analysis of data, these techniques become operational.
The precision of the facial recognition was multiplied for ten years in the past five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, director of the R&D Laboratory in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands developed automatic border positions using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or ice in movement.
"Today, we are researching on the recognition of the voice or way to walk in the help of sound captors, but we need a silent environment," says Mrs. Iyennegar, Director of Security Research in Intel Labs.
Unique and unfalsifiable mark, the DNA also takes hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it may be considered as the last biometer data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospectives to the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very cost.
The NEC proposes the court police services a valid cost of 90,000 euros to analyze DNA scales on the place of a crime and an hour.
The biometric uses are divided in two groups: identification (recognise a person among others) and authentication (with ensure that the person is the one that she wishes to be).
The identification was concerned to the delivery of identity papers: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (including, photo, ice) with the information that the State has on all citizens already held.
This allows you to ensure that anyone doesn't try to use the identity of someone else.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the VIP recognition of a hotel or a magazine.
"We get pictures of monitoring cameras and compared to photographs of the festibrities that are freely on the Internet," explains Danny Nassif, loaded in NEC France, of trade development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo on someone who makes the cup in a magazine, follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate the time of expectation.
The authentication concerned physical access (frontiers, protected locals, cantons...) or logical (opening from a computer).
Recently, the presence control was added.
"A biometer points out the phenomenon of the coffee that points for another," justified Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
In addition, the authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from Internet devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to remove the money to some distributors by introducing his card and put his hand on a biometric reader: this gas replaces the secret code.
A similar technology is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulème by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and teachers of the large distribution: while paying in store with his bank card, the client does not cover his code, but brings his deck into a reader who scans the veins.
The experience is prepared for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon come to the French tradeholders.
Tracks to save users
There are three ways to make the seduction biometer in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that she can win time.
"If, by the biometer, a client remains in 30 seconds of less, it's a favorable," explains the director of a great surface.
The second is to offer customs services: in some years a vocal server will recognize your voice and offer you options on measure.
And, finally, rasure by putting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The digital tickets are stored on a first server; identities of persons are in a second basis: Correction between both numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly safe box, which is blocked if they are trying to move it," says Philip Robin, of Thales.
But, in the absence of high-term studies, it is impossible to know whether these talks really convince the users.
Specialists of private life protection, they continue to worry.
"The progress of easy recognition, multiple monitoring cameras and the great quantity of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, I fear the worst: a generalized overseer," predicted Andrew Patrick, the Commission on the protection of private life in Canada.
A driver rounding at 210 km/h with a hot wood between the feet was seen infecting an aim of 1 000 £
An automobilist saw an amendment of $1,000 £ to roll at 210 km/h with a hot wood in equipment between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old from Titree in Essex, was repeated by leaving his Mercedes Benz on A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested it, they discovered the wood to bring between his feet.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie adopted the infringement of conduct without proudness and attention required.
The seven points removed on their permission have led to a six months of permission.
Howie was also condemned to pay costs amounting to 90 £ and a supertax for victim of 100 £.
An emphasis on the foreign immobilier owners to explore London's bull
The Tresor has properly encrypted the measure of the rate on capital wines but expected a definitive decision of Mr. Osborne in the budget 2012, which included a right of timber for the properties costing more than 2 £ and annual prices for the purchasers who choose to hold properties in the framework of a company instead of individual.
The timber right is already applied to resident properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 M £ on the fiscal exercise 2012/13, which exceeds the total quantity of North Ireland, Gales, Ecosia, North East, North-East and North-East and the region of Yorkshire and Humber meetings.
Mr. Cook said: "If the increase of the timber right on the properties of great value and the introduction of the anti-evitation law in the matter, it is very difficult to prevent that the properties of large value are submitted independently to the effects of the obsolete room rate system."
“But this change could make foreign investors in the idea of buying properties in London or the current properties in the idea of selling,” added.
The prestige immobilier – 5-10% of the highest prices of the immobilier market – in the south-west London prosper sector, which is from Fullam in Wimbledon, increased a percentage of 11,8 % in the last year.
The prices in the center of London shows a regular growth of year in 5,6%, but they have been explored by a “innermark” full growth, South-west of the city, the north (7,4%) and the east (6,5%) with a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientifics come in light how the movements of a dog are linked to his humor.
Previous studies have revealed that the happy dogs moved more their hair to the right (in view of the dog), while the nervous dogs moved it to the left.
But then scientists say that dogs can detect these subtile differences and answer them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscient of Trente University, stated: “All of us know that the left side and the right side of the brain is differently involved in the styles that exceed positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what he was in other species.
He added that as well as in the man, in the dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and fast, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs' movements, researchers followed animals in training films where other dogs were found.
They measured the heart frequency of animals and analysed their behavior.
It will certainly not need long before we understand why their cow is sometimes from one side and sometimes from the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We have presented the dogs of films where other dogs were formed – or a natural version, or a silhouette to lose any other confusion factor – and we could train the movement of the cow and present it as to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression turning the hair to the right (in view of the dog that turns the cow), they remained perfectly detened.
But when they repeated a cup of deviation mainly to the left (in addition to the point of view of the dog that turns the cheek), their heart frequency was accelerated and they had the axis.
Professor Vallortigara said that he didn't think that the dogs were freely communicated by these movements.
He thinks more than the dogs know by experience the movements they should or not be concerned.
He added: “If you meet in several times of other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their cow to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side brings a less friendly attitude, you will respond in the meaning of this experience. ”
Researchers indicate that results could allow owners, veteriners and drivingers to improve their emotions.
John Bradshaw, teacher invited to the University of Bristol's Veterinary Science School, declared that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the Chinese species.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University discovered that the dogs turned the head to the left when they looked at a aggressive dog and right when he was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study held by Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs were easierly going to a robot dog when his cheek moved to the left, instead of become anxiety – the inverse of what is found in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in various studies did not totally consider the animals of films or robots like dogs.
A study on the way the dogs respond to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
“Which many elements, reached in different mammifers, indicating that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details must still be determined – and dogs do not make exception,” said he.
However, when the facility with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not be long before we understand why their skin smoke sometimes from one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow because Alex Turner's disease
The Rock Arctic Monkeys group reported a concert to Glasgow after we diagnosed a laryingite to his song.
The Sheffield group should be celebrated in the concert room of The Hydro in the center-ville.
However, his laryingite forced the song Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was contrary to report a concert in the LG Arena of Birmingham Jeudi.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to report the concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham tonight and after they have asked a medical opinion, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the spectacle to Hydro of Glasgow on Friday 1 November.”
"Alex Turner suffers a laryingite and regrets that he can't produce in concert."
The spectacle at the LG Arena of Birmingham will be placed on 20 November and the Hydro of Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All ballets are valid for these concerts.
We want to excuse us with all the ballet detenants for all caused disagreement.
Thanks for contacting the client service to the billettery where you buy your ballets for any additional help.
Papa François will name his first cardinal in February
Papa Francois would notice new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Jewish Vatican announced.
The cardinals are the most highest church men in the Catholic Church behind the priest, and those who elect it, so François will name his first group of men who will finally choose his follower.
There's now 201 cardinal.
However, since a cardinal gets 80 years old, he can't participate in the election of a father’s choice – so it returns to a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In a statement announced the news, the father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican's port-word, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremonie during which the eggs will be higher than the cardinal dignity, known under the name of the consistry.
“Pap François decided to communicate his decision to convocate the Consistency of February to the advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings required by the participation of cardinals of different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero des Catholic Vox stated that from February, the number of electoral cardinals will probably be reduced.
He stated that a father named in general so many cardinals that he needed to get the number of electoral cardinals at 120 and so many age cardinals of over 80 years as he wanted.
The next year's consistant will be important because this will be the first since the election of Papa François in March of this year, said Valero.
For this time there is a kind of trend to privilege Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new father will name the cardinals of the rest of the world to restore the equation," he added.
40% of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first chosen since Francois has formed the counsel of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals of the whole world loaded to examine the ways to reform the church.
Before, Dad decided to be alone.
“Therefore, Francois chose these eight cardinals to help him, ” explained Valero.
He added that he was “all possible” that François requested advice to cardinals.
But we never knew such a situation — it is totally new.
Valero indicated that the patterns were generally designed to represent large communities at the cardinal range, but that Francois was “plen of surprises – so we don't know who he would call. ”
GM reminds some of its new pixmaps in the United States to repair the seats folder
General Motors Co reminds about about 19,000 of its new chips Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to resolve a problem with inclinable documents manually, according to a Friday declaration of the American organization loaded by the safety of vehicles.
On some pickups, the seats were able to present a failure at the level of the inclination mechanism.
The documents therefore do not respect the federal safety standards of vehicles relating to head-heading.
“If the vehicle is lost by the back, it may not be protected correctly by the passengers, thus increased the risk of worsts”, according to the statement shown on the National Highway Traffic Security Administration (NHTSA).
The reminded models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of vehicles for the first American builder since his failure and its restructuring in 2009.
GM reported the owners of the failure during the first 15 October.
The NHTSA could not examine the information letter to the owners because of the arrest of 16 days of government activities, which raised the growth of vehicles in October.
Silverado and Sierra, which were restored for the model 2014, increased by about 20% during the first 10 months of the year, declared the GMF on Friday.
In October, GM was sold 42 660 pieces of Silverado and 16 503 pixels Sierra.
The currency of GM actions was 1,4% to get 37,47 dollars to New York's office after-midnight.
A worker died under beton blocks
A construction worker is dead under decades of beton blocks, judich before-midnight, in Montreal.
The drama has arrived at 11 hours, on the street Marquette, near the intersection of the Beaubien Street, in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to all real estate, the works on the foundations were deployed to this place since a certain time.
A mid-based wall of funding came out in the last days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim came to come on the chain to recover its tools.
I walked in a car, and I saw the wall flowing with a big fume cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who stays near the chain.
I'm departed and I went to remove the big bricks that would recover it.
We just saw a part of his kids, it's so happy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an older man in the fifty-fifty who worked for a coffee company.
Reanimation manuals were tested by urgency services, but without success.
The man didn't survive his serious wounds.
An inspector of the Commission for Health and Safety of Working has been denied on the places to investigate the circumstances of this drame.
The cry of disappearing from a Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believed in the possibility of change
He says that Obama has made loyal efforts from the obstructionism of the Republic Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare site, nor drones attacks
Obama's campaign of 2008 is a triste reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in 2nd Medicine Faculty of Harvard.
I'm trying to read a book very threatened in these days.
It's a book that, I thought, I would encourage me during the second year of medicine and would renew me from hope.
It is called The Audacity to Win and it is a memory of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.
When I ended the medical accounts of my patients at night and I sleep, this book remembers me at the time when the policies inspired millions of people and where the talks could cut you the suffering.
The election has been completed by an extraordinary victory and the presents of the newspapers have taken the time to think about the history of the moment.
My companys have wept with joy, and my parents have stored all the journals they have found.
A young visionary team progressed to the House-Blanche and the nation was ready to change.
During the transition period of Obama before his function in 2008, he had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Return to the present is a hard reveal, it's like a dream.
It is difficult to remember these full-optimism days, such as a lot of memories, a serious reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change was actually produced in the years who followed the first time I voted.
That was nothing to see with what I thought.
I put to Obama's credit of great realizations, from the past of the Affordable Care Act (law on the advantages) to the Iraq's department of our army, through the end of the "no-nown" and the murder of Oussam Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the partisanism has destroyed too many efforts to prevent our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and closement of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after I have defensed Obama's administration against my partners and colleagues, I'm not yet going to provide explanations.
I'm on the border of the political disappearance.
Republicain obstruction cannot explain the setting of foreign leaders or the attacks of strangers who are innocent by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, or the implementation of denunciators who reveal the mistakes of the government.
She can't justify Anwar al-Awlaki's murder, an American citizen, without a process, nor the evasion of public finances and the expenditure authorized during the presidency campaigns.
She can't justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the House-Blanche to reduce the media in silence are “the most aggressive... from Nixon's administration.”
And, recently, she can't excuse the possibility of concealing a simple Internet site for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that the Government could against the political campaigns who were before it.
Of course, the electoral function is not preventable, because the political part of opposition and events, such as the Newton's massacre, influences our public discussion.
However, all the examples that I have obtained above seems to be greatly the choice of the administration.
That's what I'm worried.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was threatened by his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented a little confused and raffined alternative that seemed not to allow its policies or positions to determine.
I felt that Obama, chosen for a second mandate, freed from the pressure of future elections, would have the promises that we heard to speak for so long.
However, while the favorable views index has spread under 45% of this week, it is still more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
He wants me to want many promises that have been involved.
This week, I read the part of the book that described how Obama has lost great losses to the benefit of Clinton to the Primarities of Pennsylvania.
At a meeting of the next campaign, he said to his team that they should go back on the good path and remain faithful for their cause.
"I want us to recall our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I'm not agreed with you anymore.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, at 15 hours, a violent collision between a moto and a car was produced from Retine to Fléron.
The motard, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleron, didn't take a box.
Although the rapid intervention of safeguards is declined in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer suggests that Mr. Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on the parental congest system.
Mr. Clive Palmer advises that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental congest system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefited by this system.
The miner extraction magnet, which consists of the payment of a carbon rate of amount of 6 M$, has valued this argument to try to exceed the issues about an accidental conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control to four voices in Senat, which could be critical when decide whether carbon and miners should be deleted.
But Mr Palmer suggested that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that the daughters of Mr. Abbott were prepared to benefit personally of these policies.
“It will be an important conflict of interest when it will be paid to the parent congest because if one of his daughters is born, he will have direct interest in the fact that she gets or not a congest," said Mr Palmer.
Two months after its election, the electoral committee officially stated that Mr. Palmer has submitted the Seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 voices after repeating.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of an amendment of the suffering system to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Does this election be decided two months after the vote is completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark vote bulletins.
Is it possible to remove the result if someone doesn't agree?
Since our days, there's a paper crayon seems extraordinary.
The electoral Commission studied the options possible in respect of the electronic vote and recently published a reflection document together with the New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, stated that his political project understood an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “best serious. ”
The exercise of public functions is a public service question.
"We don't seek a reward, except the reward of the history because we have to serve the community at a critical moment," added.
A team of biologists guided by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of dauphin to the woods in the north-schools of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientist mission carried in the Observatory for Conservation and Animal Study (OCEAMM), returns for the Express on this discovery and explains the long identification process of new species.
The discovery of this new specie of dauphin in the boss is surprising you?
It's a good news, but it's not particularly surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on morphological, anatomic and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of classification of species.
Furthermore, this progress in genetic and molecular biological is not impossible that the classification or apparentness of a kind of species, a family, even see a order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, Morphologists classed animals, based on moral differences between species.
Today, some of these classs are rejected because of the progress of genetic progress.
In the same way, two very close morphological species have been distinguished through genetic.
This is the case of the new species that comes to be identified.
A decade of years ago, the scientific community recognised two species of this sub-famility: dauphins in the woods of the Pacific and the Atlantic woods.
Recent analyses have been allowed to distinguish four species.
Why is it an important discovery like the Wildlife Conservation Society?
In a view to conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by researchers, they didn't know that she was part of a new species, she presents only to this place.
Thus, if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral or accidental capture epidemy in the region, we could have been a matter of extinction of a species, instead of a local disaster of a population of a more widely expansioned species on Earth.
This loss of genetic patrimoine would be much more difficult.
A species is considered threatened or extinguished by the number of existing individuals on Earth, and the possibility that she should be restored from near stocks.
For the kind of Chinese Susa, which the population of the new type discovered is issued, its stock automatically became lower, which makes it so vulnerable.
Why is it amazing to discover new species of marine mommyfries?
The marine mammifers are located above the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open, in which there are many genetic switch between populations and individuals.
This genian brassage limits the creation of new species.
In contrast, the closer ecosystems favore the genetic isolation, which can generate the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the middle of the most known.
We are prefering to send robots on Mars, but to know what's living in the woods of the Marians, only 11 miles of the sea surface.
We spend more money in life research on other planets than in the sea research and it's a lot of time to change it.
RBS suspends two traders on the market of changes
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its market division of changes according to two nearby sources of the document, which shows a new time that the global investigation of regulators on the market manipulations of the devies begins to bring its fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the framework of the most important financial market in the world, where 5,3 billion dollars every day change.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the broadcast of the investigation that makes the scanning of the Libor interbanc rate manipulations.
The bank, which refused to comment the suspensions, confirmed that this month has received information requests from the rules.
“The investigation on this matter continued and we will completely cooperate with the FCA and the other regulators,” stated a representative of the bank for two weeks ago.
Last month, the next sources of the document stated that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages, sent to and by an old trader, to the Britann regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This training, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from its European responsibility of the training account for JPMorgan's debts.
Rohan Ramchandani, European responsibility of change training in Citi, has been set at the week, while Matt Gardiner, leader of advice to Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No of these traders made any accusation.
The folder of Mr. Usher understood instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup, added nearly sources of the folder.
The UBS explained this week that she had tried an action to meet some of her employees after the Switzerland regulator, Finma, stated that he was investigating the suspects of the market manipulation of changes in a number of Switzerland banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Authority of Switzerland competition Weko, the FCA, the United States Department of justice and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong – examines the achievements on bankers who would be understood to manipulate changes.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Swiss have also launched internal research or received regular information requests, have indicated close sources of the document.
Banks explore instant messages and emails sent for years to find a re-respectable action.
The news about these investigations have broken training in a sector that was one of the largest growth engines of the training units of investment banks during the past years, but it has been rejected because of the lack of volatility of views that limit the opportunities for specialists.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the business, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large market of liquid changes, but the elderly traders explain that it is not necessary.
An elder trader stated that, in the absence of the high volume of quota change transactions, the fragment of liquidity between scramble management platforms and the use of more frequently by the banks of their own internal platforms " explains that it is possible to have an impact on the market at a lot of price."
The news arrived even on the day when the Sweden Credit announced that a trader was sent to his office of the funds negotiated by the London Bourse this week after he had caused a loss of 6 M$ last year.
The bank has rapidly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the business has been dominated,” said a representative of the Switzerland Credit.
The investigation on Madam Rob Ford has been built, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that he had put his hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford fumping from crack, Me Clayton Ruby has never seen a "so bucked".
My Ruby said to the Canadian Press that the police had "ignoned or minimized" the evidence elements against the marine.
This Jeudi, the police stopped the optional friend and chauffeur of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, 35-year-old, and accused him of extorsion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was a frequency contact with the madre.
The police also said that he had observed this man who delivered coles in Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
My Ruby has qualified "incrementable" the fact that the police had never fought the car of Rob Ford or his home, or have listened to his phone, supporting that the policeman Bill Blair had chosen in knowledge of reason to not act against the master.
According to the law, the police, having been a witness of suspected transactions in their own hands, would have been very well to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, to stop the master, and to perform an investigation - even without mandate.
She could also require an instant investigation mandate if necessary.
The police boss not commented, but his por-word Mark Pugash qualified the proposals of Me Ruby's "expected and unexpected intention" to be valuable to media in a case that doesn't matter it.
In pressing conference, Jeudi, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute " reasonable reasonable reasons" that could lead to the deposit of a criminal accusation against the marine.
The European Bourses are down to the average, except London
Without London, the main European Bourses develop in a half-second bottom, flowed by some news of disasters, while Wall-Street is expected to be high.
Furthermore, the investors remain careful because they consider that the American Federal Reserve may renew its quantitative assessment policy as soon as proposed.
In contrast, after the announcement of an inflation to 0.7% for the whole euro area, the idea is expanded among the market actors that the European Central Bank (ECB) could apply its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street allows an opening of American actions in high, after two follow-up sessions of reply.
At values, Renault (-4,63%) records the strongest response of the CAC 40, which was struggled by the warning on the result of his partner Nissan Motor Vendredi.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, and then published the results in lowing this morning and announced the creation inside a deficiency structure ("bad bank") with 38 billion of the most risked active books.
From its side, Vodafone (+2,45%) is maintained in the head of the EuroFirst300 heights of EuroFirst 300 in reaction to a pressure information that AT&T will study an OPA event.
On the market of changes, the specifications on the development of the monetary policy of the ECB will be good training, such as John Hardy, a Saxo Bank strategy.
The only mandate of the ECB has always been inflated, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week meeting.
We're going to get a strong potential of low euro.
In this context, the euro continued its replies against the American monkey and touched one lower than two weeks to $1,3517.
The same conjections support the obligatory market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court is valid to the Reform Act of the Health System of Obama
Great victory for Obama administration: The Supreme Court of the United States stated today that the law of reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges have validated the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of diseases and adherent care) – which requires that citizens subscribe a health insurance from 2014, in the absence of paying a amendment – and declared that it was constitutional in accordance with the Government's imposition authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, was advised to the four freest members of the Court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Act of 2 700 pages and, in addition, considered that the provision of the Reform of Health System Reform Act, which indicates that the level of equilibricability to Medicalid should be able to lose all federal finances of the programme, was coherent in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law has been committed by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major republian candidates at the presidency election at least during the primary year 2012, including the candidate designed by Mitt Romney, have been oppressed by the law.
Vibrant hommage made to old fighters in Menton
In the heart of Trabuquet's citizens, civil authorities, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotical associations, made this Friday after-midnight, an honour to soldiers and disappearances of all wars.
There were two of the three military squares of the cimeter by Jean-Claude Guibal and various persons.
Agreement between Palestinians and Israelites at Gaza border
Four fighters of Hammas were killed and five Israelian soldiers were violated July 31 October 2013 in the evening of a violent crossing at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only electronic center of the Gaza band has stopped working on Friday 1 November after the exposure of its carburant stocks, has announced the Palestinian energy energy Authority.
A local commander of Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another frame of the army band of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, was killed by a car car officer in a front of the Israeli army in the east of Khan Younès, in the south of Gaza band, according to local medical sources.
Two other local responsibilities of Brigades Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when a Israeli helicopter opened the fire in the same region.
Their bodys were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters led a monitoring operation in the border area between the Palestinian key and Israel.
A attack against a tunnel crossed by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli car and a blind bulldozer made a centuries of meters in the territory before they turn away.
The opposite has been a half-hour, according to witnesses.
In a communicating, a port-wort of Hamas, Sami Abou Zouhri, made four "heroes" hommage and said that Israelian soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
The Hamas welcomes the heroes of Al-Qassam who have fallen in defending the territory during a missionary employment in Khan Younès.
Many enemies have been killed and hurt during the operation.
"The Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupiant," threatened the door.
At his side, the Israeli army indicated that the purpose of his operation was a section of a large tunnel crossed in the country of Israel since the Palestinian key, discovered on 7 October and destined, according to the army, "Terrorist activities".
The Hamas invested the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, as it was the purpose to remove Israelian soldiers to switch them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was expected to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communicating.
During the operation, Hamas declared a explosive engine in respect of the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli Army) and struck five soldiers.
Israelian attack in the north of Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israelian citizens," also indicated Peter Lerner's army.
Moreover, Israel struck an aircraft base in the north-west Syria, in view of a load of missiles destined to the Libanese Citizens Hezbollah, reported July 31 October the satellite chain Al-Arabiya.
An American responsibility confirmed a "Israelian flag" but didn't give detail on the target.
"For the past, the targets were transferred to Hezbollah," he felt to add.
The Israeli government's responsibilities refused to confirm all information on such a attack.
Since the "exclusive sources" that she has not been named, the Saudi Captain Chapter indicated that "the bombardment has shown a carrying of sol-air mixes that were destined to Hezbollah in Libanon", referring to the strong libanese movement that fights the rebels at the side of the Syrian forces.
Moreover, a Syrian NGO, Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, had made a number of explosions held in the air base of a Air Defence in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian Coast.
This organization was not able to identify the origin of explosions by military and medical sources.
Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, which presents in Danse its two new group chlorographies: the first inspired increasing and poems of Henri Michaux, the second insufficed by the famous solos of Gymnopédies of Satie.
A evening that allows you to see the whole capture of Chouinard, the art of the tickets and the black white white.
A white screen of ground wall.
On the board, like white, in the large space that is the Houseuneuve Tea, is going, profile, end like a line and black clothing, a body.
On the screen, Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simple trait, take its form.
And this form will be the entire room: a physical emittements of designs.
Dancers, full of black clothing, only the hands and the face discovered, wait for each side of the game air, are precise when the next graphy appears, the incarnant, resident in the current.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in relationship with soldiers, in group with unisson (a mass that makes a single), in a large group of twelve sols where each one runs his sign.
It is thinking about "Gloire of the morning", where Chouinard had been a series of crossographic tasks written on the carts, located online on the front scene.
It's the same principle, the PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, smoking and electronic guitars.
The energy is high, the ritme is always fast.
There will be case when Carol Prieur will flee under the dance board, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or holding, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocorde and monocorde in the cry, and continue to dance.
And the music to distribute, and the sequence of recovery.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if it can be, ended by assurrection and energy.
As it also makes the regularity of the visual ritme.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a force in the Chouinard - such as those hairs that are explored or these black tissues that have long lines.
But the crossographic approach is missing composition.
We are impressed that the crossographe, instead of to meet Michaux's work, was imposed, with its tickets.
Result: Bodies seem to be platt before the designs.
Michaux's growth, such as Gestalt's forms, opened a larger and giboyable imaginary than the dance, more painful.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers held by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black teatro, touched magic.
The public loved, the accusation was healthy.
The Gymnopedies, after the tract, is more rich.
The scene is part of grid dragged, dancers and a plane are covered from tissue, such as mubble in a lot of house.
At the plane, dances are relaxed to play partitions.
Their mal addresses in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On the scene, the couples, in two lovely, very sensitive, even herotics.
Group work, small transitions, together moved, choices, writing is less binary.
Boupons appear, also Family officers of Chouinard, woodening the red nest, in very polarised men's loved paradies.
Love are carnaxers, fuckers or players.
The gestually, ries and small crises transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the body in coat, beasts based on.
But the room takes its real involving after heal.
A clown comes back to scene when the public leaves.
There, everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explosed universes are superposed, caboting dancers, descending among the spectators, glooming, fuming, short-circumcising, playing codes of applaudment, spreading the sauce in a calculated sauce that remains sensitive.
The joy and fault transformed, and it's the art of Chouinard, there, to count the public.

Egypt requests the First President freely chosen to offer pleasure
Mohamed Morsi prepared the vote to invest, but it is less probable that his triomphe day marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergency of a new “Egypt” when he prepared the vote to invest to the President, so he became the first freely elected President and succeeded in Hosni Moubarak, who was disappeared from the power of 16 months ago.
In its investment before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first islamist President freely chosen from the Arab world and the Fifth Chief of Egypt's State since the reversation of the monarchie has been 60 years ago.
He made a pleasure before the 18 judges in black clothing of the Court, which the building in the border of the Nil was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
“ We are aspiring at the next day, a new Egypt and a Second Republic, ” said the President Morsi during the solemn ceremony distributed directly on the public TV.
“ Today, the Egyptian people put the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability, ” explained Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed in the United States, as Muslim Brothers, a fundamental group considered for more than 84 years since its training as an illegal organization and sustained by the following governments.
hundreds of soldiers and police keeped the building when Mr. Morsi arrived a little after 11 hours, local hours, followed a small conviction.
Only several hundreds of supporters were gathered before the Court to call the new President and, beginning from the fast president of Mouarak's years, the circulation was only shortly interrupted to allow the transition of its conviction in very frequent streets relating to the center-ville to the South Banks.
Considered as the "profit road" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige was significantly strengthened from his victory and his feast talking during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work under 2011 against the President Moubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red coast, addressing the judges present in the room of trees, where he swore.
Afterward, Mr. Morsi went to the University of the Caire where he spoke to instruction.
He was officially achieved by a military fanfare who played the national himne while he was guarded to you.
The marrechal Hussein Tantaoui visited the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was achieved by the song "The people and the army, hand in the hand..." toughed by thousands of people gathered together in the great amphithater of the university.
Based in 1908 and old laick education based, the University of the Caire became a fifth of the Islamist students groups in 1970.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic vote on the place of Tahrir, from where the submission has finished in Moubarak's authorised regime last year, and has sworn to reach the President's powers which the military advice, which has replaced the elder president, has deposited it.
But by accepting officially a priest's vote before the Court, instead of the Commission as it is useful, he is inclined before the will of the army, showing that the fight for power is not completed.
Mr. Morsi's talk on Tahrir's place has been attached to spectacular populations management.

Do you think the travel agencies were in the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to turn the trend.
The society has revealed its net benefits to the highest and hope of record results through Australia and the United Kingdom vacancies.
The travel agency is then expected to fulfil a sub-jacent benefit on the total of the exercise between 325 and 340 M$ before imposed, against a previous preview of 305 to 315 M$.
If the current previsions are achieved, this will represent 12 to 17 % of growth in relation to the record of 290.4 M$ in 2011/12.
The Director of General Graham Turner stated that Flight Centre had produced 8 % of benefits on the first semester and that the second semester had started in force, in particular in the respect of the travelways other than the business travels in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"After the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are rewardable, and many of them are in a good way to realize record results on the whole exercise before deducting interests and impositions," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally countries that generate the greatest benefits.
In Australia, the traveling sector was rebounded during the second semester, which allowed to compensate a home market of lower business travels.
Like the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre traveling sector has recorded good results while business clients have expensed less.
His office in the United States reached its losses during the first semester where the saisonary request was lower and had to take a benefit on the whole exercise for the third consecutive.

Schools are encouraged to concentrate more on mathematics, orthography and grammar
In the framework of English literature courses, students must study at least one part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British fiction work in 1914 in our days.
The exam will also present new texts to encourage a more diversified reading.
A combinating literature and language course will be removed.
From 2015, students will have to pass a independent language GCSE, and they will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate quality in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must tomorrow publish its new English and Math programmes – the first materials to get a radial review.
It will proceed changes in other fundamental materials in the next year.
Furthermore, the Regular Office of Experts will devote a change of the GCSE structure, with a new notation system and less course.
In expression during the earlier, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a large consensus about the need of reforming our tests system to restore public confidence, instead of the fact that GCSE would be more stimulating, ambitial and more rich.
Studies show that English schools consist of less time for maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools propose in average 143 hours per year, and the students of Singapore are about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to celebrate more hours of employment for mathematics, the nearest sources of coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of Flood Maths – even the greatest importance given to materials in international classes – would certainly encourage schools to ensure more courses.
The programme will further accent on the “real world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in this State and that largely rejects the right to advocate will be able to enter into force.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroun villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team are nearly all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in this country of West Africa, at least 1 for 5 000 people.
Voice here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the election of "Heros CNN in the year".
This person will receive $2500,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
During 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his father's disease to change the conscious and unconscious periods and get into hospitals who were not equipped to come to him in help.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroun.
In the beginning, he had only a brain cut off, but he contracted a infection that was propagated until his brain, creating a hematome that he was going to bring as the rest of his life.
“ There was no neurochirurgians in Cameroun, ” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him to the stranger if we had enough money.
Instead of this, Dr. Bwelle passed years to attend his father in hospitals and hospitals, so that he could receive any treatment he could benefit.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 hours, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father's death in 2002.
In Cameroun, there are only 1 doctors for 5 000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In comparison, the relationship in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 residents.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounais could not pay the consultation.
Two of five people in the country live below poverty, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure are fulfilled in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is the poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't benefit from life.
After seeing his father and so much of his compatriotes suffered, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his welfare team worked more than 700 cyrurgic acts freely during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular chirurg in the centre hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a humanitarian association to non-profit objective, ASCOVIME, which comes into the rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of welfare helped about 30,000 people.
Almost all feasts, with a 30-year-old persons, they feel in fugonnets after they have fixed the medical material on the top and traveled hard lands to go to villages that need most help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They had to put the vehicles once to travel rivers or bullshots.
But when they arrived, they were received in heroes: the community organizes a feast, sing and dance and offers the best available apartments.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to make the feast, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great sorrow and its dealing energy – is more happy to join the festivals.
The team begins to receive hundreds of patients next morning.
“ We receive 500 people every visit, ” said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live at 60 km from the village, and they're coming to foot.
In this early hospital, various health cares are provided.
Many people receive a treatment against paludism, tuberculose, malnutrition, diabetes, parasits and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others may receive bottles, a couple of collected balls or a free birth certificate – document required to go to school, but many poor families can only not allow them to buy it.
On the evening, the practical team of simple chirurgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practical in a school, a madrid or a house; after intervention, the patient rises up and goes into the reveal room to leave his place to the next person.
With the lighting of the electrogene group, the operation room and the sterilisation of the material, Dr. Bwelle and its benefits work until the first hours of the morning.
It's an exciting ritme, but musicians of the villages generally help the team to stay motivated.
“ They shoot on tambours all night to keep us awake, so we can continue to work, ” explains Mr. Bwelle.
Wednesday, the team returns to the city, fatigue but honour of the work she has done.
The group, composed of camerounian doctors and doctors in medicine, has worked freely 700 chirurgical acts during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the differences for those who are in help.
A man explained that the free operation that he had taken up to heal a hero would allow him to work again.
“ This will change my future and my family, ” said the man.
More than to live this hospital initiating and working as a chirurg in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle works the night in private medical cabinets around Yaoundé.
This is the second employment, explains, which finances to 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of the University of Drexel to Philadelphia and welcome in the group of Dr. Bwelle.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to make these campaigns.
For medical students and sick students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to meet Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is a opportunity to learn on the land they are not home.
“We could participate in operations to help smoking blood or to pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” explains Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying medical in second year.
Favourite students generally pattern their journey to Cameroun, and often come with the collected medical material.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," says Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his effort to help the camerounian people is not near to exceed.
For Dr. Bwelle, relatively constant work charge is not a difficulty.
Help others to live happy by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him a great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” adds Mr. Bwelle.
And I think my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
Smile people and smile pain are the reasons I can do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, colleagues have long-term planned to define and sit on Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphiteateries and course salts?
No doubt, but underlined his low ways for travel paths, sciences-Po, the High Etudes.
Orbiting other works in his office of Gaston-Gallimard Street?
In fact, however, ignoring the hidden work and the subterrane writer of the editor.
Heritage of the Honor that works Fontenale in France Academy?
Certainly, but, knowing that such holy saint would not be able to replace the true holy oil, the thées, which he has passed.
They have recognised in him a great survey, animator, and federator of their work, but in order to observe that he would have been a little inclined to produce himself.
To this incertain image, the monument of the "Memory places", which he added his name, also contributed.
The bad languages have seen a giant market to the pockets, presented by a intelligent commentor, covered by an eye of eye, but incorruptiblely delegated.
The two works published by Nora here about two years have already established that he who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book that is here should make him definitively justice.
However, a more time, the temptation of urbicity, the intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation made to escape as joint feet of one of the other.
But it is quickly understood that the abstracted objects collected in this book in such a beautiful title brings the brochure to a single and even passion: it is to discover the constitutive news of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to the national unit?
Identity: it's a time concern.
Here's a little bit, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the perpetual spirit of our leaders of others, the French identity was an immediate existence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, jacobinism obvious, was trusted to prefects and subpriefs, authorized interprets.
The one who tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He is not in heritage of an everlasting France, he refuses to definition.
Analysis is concerned about a family strange, he is mistaken in a forest of symbols, stopped every step by an object in the form of rebus, turned to irrigant issues.
So this, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so sustainablely installed in its borders, as anciently charpent and solidly making, hear these dramatic calls at the unit?
They're not so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, but to conjure the born problem of French story.
Frances and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and protestants: divisions forces, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one who runs in two national history.
At the series of the Revolution, the French have two historys, and they have two nations, one monarch, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without coming to the near; congratulations against finding sacrality and even more avoidable unit and invisibility that she had cut the head to him who was the clear and powerful incarnation.
And from there a nation invinciblely binary, divided between left and right, lacicity and Catholicism, worship and hate of revolution.
To make this singularity of the French identity, nothing is the four steps outside Hexagon, although the American shipping of Peter Nora could be well the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and another a revolution, reported a declaration of the rights, wanted to fund a new society.
But the American counsel is only better to underline what is our own.
There were men who had left their old Regime in England and had no longer to take care of them.
Here are men combined by a Indien Regime, and now more rare.
There is a consensual revolution when she has seen the drama and the confit.
There are fundamental fathers always honored, and here are revolutionary ancients who are concerned to make models, and who are the rest of them.
There is a institutional consistency, and here is a box of constitutions, such as errors to ratify and try to recover.
France who's gone, France who's coming
However, there was a time when Frances believed that they could recover the decreased clothes of their history, and win the destruction of the two numbers.
In this IIIe Republic, the central and creative moment, Peter Nora showed much interest and even tendency: welcome those who were then employed to reform the revolutionary fracture, teaching schools all that in ancient France was clearly prepared for the modern France and proposing them a unique version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was just a time.
This is the new debate, which is broken by an immigration of a new type, injured by amount of revendicative minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers it once fascinating from France who goes and the examination of France who comes.
With, first, the story port, which should keep some surprises.
We discover that the road was a marriage.
The man of multiple interests turned, lightly obsessional, around the same idea.
The lisar roaded in the center.
And he who had deposited, here is more than a halfth century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but he was submitted to the initial exercise of the thées, we trust, with a great outside, that he would have finished it.
Certainly under a less raid form, more exclaimed and higher.
But we don't throw up there, even contrariant.
Since the figure imposed by the university cursus, this theesis says the internal need of life.
An older otage in Libanon: "The return is enough complex to control"
To Beyrouth, March 8, 1986, with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" came to film a manifestation of Hezbollah, the journalist John-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later on November 27, 1987.
Retraction since 2008, he participated in the creation of the defence association of the world's otages, which he preached for several years.
His main objective: to obtain the opportunity for offences to take clearly and to carry out their challenges before the International Criminal Court.
In more than 1,000 days, the four accommodations of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb), Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Peter Legrand and Marc Feeret were released March.
After medical exams at the military hospital of the Great Val-Grace Mercedy after midnight, they could, since, find their families.
And try, sometimes, to take the course of their life.
"The New Observatory" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old reporter, retreated since 2008, President of the Association of the World Otages.
Since the evening of your freedom, you were on the board of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your freedom today?
In particular, in Beyrouth.
When I'm free, I'm in the box of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He said, "We're freed," but I'm not sure, and I say we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tendent.
This is the war, and those who lead us are too very tendent.
They put us on the border of a trottoir.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we're coming on the site of Summerland Hotel where the pressure is present.
Frances are bringing us to France's embassy.
It's the time of the first couple to parents, family, friends, pressure...
I remember I took a bathroom for a hour.
And I've been dedicated to the th-shirt in France's embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we don't have ways to move to the Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
When you arrived in the helicopter, we take a private airport that returns us to France through Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarca.
How was your arrival on the French ground disappeared?
We're driving to Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is there.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible bosculate.
And a lot of media.
When I went, there were three television chains.
I'm back and there's full.
The descent of the aircraft, finding them with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
between the airport and my home, many motives follow our car that Roussin drives.
Motors took the ball to make photos and followed me to my home where I have to do the police a little while to stop some of them to get up.
Medical pressure is great.
It doesn't stop. We're well placed to know...
But the emotion and fatigue state is as difficult to see it clear.
We're out of a shoe, and we're all under the mediatic fires.
It's a bit complicated, a little violent, enough complex to control.
But we did the hardest.
Tonight, I'm at 20:00, the next morning I'm at the television.
Then starts a kind of readaptation to life, very hardly, for one or two months that are a little like vacances.
How have the medical tests and the DGSE debriefing been past?
I had the right to a first medical control in Corse.
The rest was made in Val-de-Grace the following days I came back: radios, tests in all kinds and meet with a psychiater.
It's not a meeting that makes everything, but we know that we can count on him, remember if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the information services.
They have asked me questions about the officers.
It was logical.
It didn't win me.
How do you react today to the freedom of the four Niger's otages?
I'm listening to what he says.
The debate on the weapons, in particular.
Some things energy me, at least.
I'm trying to make the part of the matters on my past as an attempt and my president's assessment "World Otages" that allows me to make a distance, and I seem more interesting to approach.
I ask for example about the definition of the resistance.
In particular, I struggle, with others, for the recognition of the legal statute of the toggle.
I mean, there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify the presence of "political" taxes - what is the case of the most time - and allow the offences to have access to justice, to take clearly and to bring their taxes to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once more, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices the freedom of these otages.
But who says that these occasions might have access to justice?
A court in the Haye is done for this.
Why wouldn't we seem to the officers of the battle's rules, such as those of all Geneva Conventions, we'll bring you to justice?
I think I'm founded, legal, smoking of a good sense.
This message is listed, but not listened, and that's what I'm doing.
It's my main fight.

Obama takes back on its reform of the health system
Under a critical balance, President Obama has been returned yesterday to his promise without emergency and often repeated according to that “if you are satisfied with your health system, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of people have received opinions of resistance from their providers, the republicans have criticized the President during the last days by accusing the US people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The greatest majority of people who have a health security that they have to keep it, ” he stated in a conversation in Boston.
The President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to search for a new insurance on the market.
Most people can obtain full health regimes and better adjusted for the same price, sound for less precious than the proposed.
"You will go out of it," he said.
The Administration announced that the 5 % of the population who contract themselves were able to change the regime because their coverage does not satisfy the new standards required under the Afffordable Care Act.

A resident of Avervilliers launchs his part of the bank
We don't even throw up.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Banlie Party" is not only addressed to banlieusards.
I've chosen a French map as a logo, justifying you.
When I speak about the bank, I'm addressed to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented in press conference in its natural community of Aubervilliers, is born from the desire to defense multiculturalism, this great cultural melting that characterizes before all the quarters.
My proposal No.1 is to create a multiculturalism minister, indicating it.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territory attached, is now revendic as "100% apolitic" even though it is not always neutral.
Militant in 2002 at Jean-Pierre Chevening, he then supported locally Dominic of Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I predict in my program are cut off to the left but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them.
There's only extremist parts I'm not talking.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune builds its - consultable program on the Internet - from a number of issues to speak to the residents of banlia and in particular to young people: vote right for strangers, legislation of cannabis, citizen majority to 16 years, rehabilitation of building guards...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the municipal elections of 2014, it is risking to be just, recognizes it."
It's a problem for time and money.
The Party of the Bank should even be represented by Aubervilliers through my candidate and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven list headers in the Metropolitin France and Martinique.
"And the support e-mails I received since yesterday are not all exchanged from banlieue" he rejoiced.
John Kerry admitted, done without previously, that American spionage “with too far inappropried way ”
John Kerry indicated a defense attitude of the United States in respect of its monitoring programmes in order to admit, without previously, that in many cases, the speed was “with too far inadequately inadequately.”
The State Secretary-General also admitted that he had, as Barack Obama, governed on "auto-pilot" when a series of fire reveals of the delegator Edward Snowden on the NSA spioning activities had seen the day.
The flights have set the American government in the center of a diplomatic temperate with his alians.
Without a intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is indeterminable that the President, myself and other members of the Government, have taken knowledge of some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, since the Second World War and to the difficult years of the Flower War, and then on 11 September."
Afterward, he became the first member of the Government of the United States to admit that the American spione had exceeded the branches, but insisted that the rights of each person were not violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far in a way inadequate. ”
And the President is resolved to try to clarify and clarify clearly the people that he now processed a close review of these practices, so that no one feels threatened.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuses in the framework of this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, in the fact that the NSA had been a power to be able to do well and that its monitoring operations had been saved of many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to save themselves. ”
There is a radically extremist in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to explore and attack governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they're done?
We've been amazing and disappearing aircrafts, explosion buildings and people to be killed because we've been able to know the facts in the past.
At least, American legislators will come to Europe to respond to concerns on the proposed American spione business and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, the President of the Secretary-General on the European Affairs.
The Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut stated that he was expressed before the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that it was concerned about the threats they had pronounced about an possible anti-terroristic organizations because of the feeling of frustration that surveys the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that the Europeans remain at our side in the mutual fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democratic democratic servant of his first mandate, and President of the European Secretary-General of the European Affairs, during a treatment from Washington.
And I'm going to go to Europe so that I will understand them that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, although the wrath of the NSA programmes has been carried out.
The pressure that the NSA has taken millions of communications in Europe, which has made bad relationships with some United States alities, however, the Director of the Agency declared this week that it was unexpected and that it was a misunderstanding because it was concerned with metadatas that the OTAN aliates had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have been made of documents developed by Snowden according to which the NSA had intercept data and communications from the Portable phone of the German Angela Merkel and of the 34 other State Leaders.
The Director of Information Services, James Clapper, justified the spioneing of aliates in indicating that it was necessary and that it was a current practice of both sides.
In this Tumulte atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was a traveling from the Congress, which should have been located this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would understand the members of the two parts and two rooms.
The names of other participant legislators should be devoted in the future.
He indicated that the ingredient remained to define.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this travel was to enhance the relationships, but also to make evidence of “acceptable closeness”.
He explained that the heads of the European States should be honest with their citizens about the type of spione programmes they apply themselves for years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes to be better protecting the rights of the Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only world to do the spione," said Murphy.
At the same time, Mr. Kerry was proposed to take up this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the rancure born by the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and the United States overseer activities.
The London Bourse closed in low judicial, plombed by the evil results of Shell and the next day of an announcement by the Fed of maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as proposed.
