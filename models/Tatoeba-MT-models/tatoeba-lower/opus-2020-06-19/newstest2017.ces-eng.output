The Czech Roads invested to modernization of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have climates and new toaletes.
In the last six years, the State transporter invested more than 31 billion corners.
The third car is currently built by climateing, the half of the flowers has a new system closed by WC.
However, the participation of modernization in individual years with exception of 2012 is progressive.
The Czech Roads in the last six years invested in modernization of the vehicle over 31 billion corners.
Third car is currently built climate explosion, the half of the flowers has a new system closed by WC.
The funded money appeared in the reduction of the average staff for two years at location and the same units and six years in classic vagons.
The larger part of the investment gave the transporter to the regional transport where the rate of 60 per cent of those money was measured, and 40 per cent of the company invested into the renewable vehicles for continuous transport.
The average stage of location and unit in the present time has 19 years.
Modernized old vehicles are, but in this shower, they are used as a whole new.
If the modernization of the vehicles would not be calculated, the average stairs of the NGO driving for 10 years would grow.
Some of the elders are in the middle of personal vagons, which a average age in modernization is 23 years.
If it would be considered only a year since the date of production, the average staff of these vehicles would be 33,4 years.
Classic arrangements based on vagons and packed location, however, in the last years of the Czech and the global ferrovies are replaced and are replaced by motor or electric units.
In the middle of 2011 and 2015, 280 to 223 cups were located, as well as the number of classic vagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in half aeroplane.
The carrier was saved, especially the old vehicles saved by cows and the doors without the possibility of locking opening during the vehicle.
From January to June, the vehicle left 110 these cars.
From the investment planning in the vehicle park, the CRD planning to purchase the near future, it is possible to introduce purchase 50 vagons for speed to 200 kilometers in hour, which the transporter plans to put on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapš, or a framework contract on the purchase of electric units for tuberculous speed trace.
The Treaty calculates the repeat to 30 motor costs and 20 electric units.
Fourth year, the Offices know about the illegal statement, they can't be able to escape her.
We're absolutely unfortunate, they recognize.
For the fourth year, online editor of the journal currently.Che follows the story of billboard in South China, which now loves motorists to visit Lipna, where it is not only touristic interesting traveling in corner trees, but also the Olympic Park.
The remote managers know that they're staying in the night, but they say they can't do anything with it.
Like records are hundreds of hundreds, maybe thousands.
According to the officers, it is a chat law that is not possible to remove the illegal mobile billboards immediately.
The requirement is based on the burrocratic ring.
I mean, but the company changes the name and the office is short on it.
Or the reklame is enough to move on a few meters and the official process must be restarted.
The guideline of the carrier and the training for fourth year has been accepted: on the main tattoo of the Czech Budayjovic on Lipno stands on our ground at the state street of the billboard in the night.
Not three months but the officers did not have enough to save the unautorised transported constructions with the insertion plot.
Like nobody said that they stay close to the cars, in a 50-time-term protection steel, where nothing can happen because of security.
The motor manager says that they can't be able to advise with the billboard because of the robbery law.
You need to put it out and take it out.
"We can't just allow this," says the speaker of the Motor Directory and Nina Ledvin and refers to a comprehensive burrocratic cold that the billboard should be exceeded according to the law.
The event of this specific billboard, which has started online journal currently. But details to look on the ground, then it is not unique and shows the general problem that does not have to stay effectively and quickly resolve the offices.
Only in South Czech Redaction, 10 similar mobile records were located against rules closely by vehicles or near their nearby.
They're like that and other countries.
"We have difficulties to require companies to remove the travellers," confirms the Board of the Board of Transport of the Czech Buddy's National Agency of Jiri Klasa, whose college like story is resolved.
According to the book, it's a famous law that the officers cut off.
First, the billboard leader must make the officer to give the reklame away.
Only the chef firms are often untrusted or knowing the pent already currently. However, in the past, it was described when the problem began to be more interested: enough mobile staff with reklame to move on a couple of meters and officers can be previously designed to remove black insertion to go to the waste.
That's because the office needs to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone sends her and the coordinate is unlikely, it is looking at it as a new device, and we have to fix the manager again," explains Jiri Clase.
The new law can't help.
The change could bring a new law which will prohibite billboards at the southern and limit them even at the I. board.
The criteria shows that the rules for compliance of illegal and easily transmissible reclaims remain the same as still.
And the officers don't like that.
The firms can continue to make ten to hundred million corners a year and no one can't be on them.
For example, billboard that loves Lipno is a company of Comercist Billboard.
The officers know it well: the Checobudijovian governor with her currently leads three administrative managers for the night established billboards.
The company is worried in every tristed test.
It is one of more reports that were not allowed to be located in the protection box of Class I.
The Government is not yet finished, says Jaroslav Miza, the captain of the Chaskobudejovian Government.
But it's interesting, but it's not yet figured between these cases, but it's quickly to come to them with the most probable possibility.
According to the RSSD, Niny Ledvin's companies did not respond to repeated written calls to remove, and the case will be achieved at the table of the national and, likely, to the government officers.
The community of the Commerce Billboard is to the underlying company that can't be contacted.
She doesn't need an e-mail and a official seat on the River has been interrupted more than six years ago.
It's not clear who's behind her.
In the past, the company went to the southern company of Anton Fischer, who asked an asteroid shop with the chief captain of the Hyundai mark.
Fischer, whose company of Euro Billboard has workers from Comrz Billboard and offers them to incertains, but in the past refused any relationship.
At the same time, when RSD started to reach the Reklame at Lipno, Fisher left the State Officers to send a letter for the secret company Comz Billboard to his pension where the new seat company was given.
However, no one of this address was invited to the remote managers today.
Morning fight.
The similar smoking or transparency changes of the steel are not normal.
One company has been tried for two million corners before a few years ago.
It just changed the name and ICI and it was nothing to resolve.
The executor returned, the records continued, maybe in other places.
We're contrary to similar companies and their business practices are too inevitable.
It's like battle with wind milks, recognised under the conditions of preservation of anonymity one of the officers.
The new law in this regard, no one will fix.
Currently. Some messengers have been talking about the problem.
But there's no activity.
They also appeared messengers who wanted to extend the terms to maintain billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for public, but also national and general policies very citizen and some skizofren issue.
On one side, they know about social questions after their limits, and on the other hand they need for inheritance in the pre-selected campaigns.
I don't stop that directly carried out that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.

France's going to get on the products of judgeists.
Without help of muslims, it's not going.
France have a fight against radically islamism to help Muslims themselves.
The Government of the Prime Minister Manuela Valls is also clearly the fundamental changes in the work of measuring and education of spiritual education.
We closed 20 measuring and prayers from the lone scenario.
And the others will follow, he announced the Ministry inside.
It works over hundred gigant producers in the country.
"If the Muslims will not help the State in battle against those who discharge public freedom, it will still be more difficult for France to resolve this freedom's recognition," announced the Premier Manuel Valls.
In particular, to ensure that in the fields and prayers, only immature that were trained in France.
He wants to stop financing from the border.
At the moment it comes from the foreign at least 20 per cent of money to build new massage, most of Marokko, Algerian and the Persian Affairs.
And then, in the middle of the ships, there are catastrophes that can develop radicalism in France.
"Our country has to show that islam is consistent with the democracy," added the premier.
The key that will ensure the fulfillment of these objectives will be a new French islamic position.
It should be worked as a monster between the cellar State and the Muslim's smaller.
There's no money out of the strange.
In the country now, the French position for the islam based in 2005 by the Premier Dominique de Villepin.
It had already had to contribute to the extent of financial toxics between the messians and countries financing their construction.
Only the institutions have immediately raised internal differences and rivality.

One of them is a special payment or payment on food balls.
There'd be a payer in the practice for the sales of food, and that's for the delivery of the certificate.

The French Government is currently in the challenge against radicals.
And the others will follow, he recently announced the Ministry inside.
In France, there is no place for those who speak to hate and respect some principles of our country, such as the equality between women and men.
In the land, according to the disobediences, almost 2500 measures and prayers will be made.
It seems that 120 of them are under the effect of the radical islamism.
Since 2012, the officers have exposed 80 imams, and in some other decades it is considered.
Not everybody thinks that the steps of governments will be explicitly able to fight against radicalism.

Traitor Kelemen was playing in 1 round sprint with the Baugem star.
For the procedure to the eight-final, the Czech tree cyclicist must be struck in the right drivers.
The tree cycleist Paul Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro after the progress of the quality of sprinting between the best eleventh was played in 1 round with the French major Gregory Baugem, the gain of silver from the old herds in London.
The procedure to the eight-final must be struggled in the right drivers.
At the beginning of the king’s discipline on the road, 27 captains were set and the best Czech Traveler was writed to the fourteenth best time.
The two-year-old started for 9,969 seconds.
In the main equipment phase he expected him to qualify the fifth Bauge, which has already been from Ria Bronz in the team sprint.
Kelemen, however, at the end, looked at France's experience, however, looked on the process.
It's a great trial with the jason Kenny gold officer.
Eight-year-old-year-old Brit took the third fastest two-year-old story and qualification played in the olympian record 9.551.
Then, as he expected, he also advised the last procedure, which was German Maximilian Levy.

Young doctors Button: They want light wind in the field
Young doctors were assembled to approve new steps in their relationship with the new covenant.
The Council of young doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) should request the full Council of supporting other operators from the beginning of September.
JDC says that the ministry's issues were not able to resolve.
Young doctors and medical students in July refused to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 % of its members who participated in the choices.
In the letter of the members published on Friday night on Twitter, JDC Ellen McCourt showed that the Government remained “and continued to be inquired” to ask questions, which is very important to refuse the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive authority decided to reject the proposed new agreement and request a new formal action in all questions."
The Executive Council of the Government has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to apply the executive programme of exploited counsel actions from the beginning of September.
Spor led young doctors a year to state to six stages, including the first general stages in the NHS history.
The leader of the young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawan, rejected the decision to refuse the agreed conditions that BMA recommended.
Members of the BMA at weeks before voting 54,000 young doctors and medical students said that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the voting of the Ministry of Health, he said that the agreement would sign for medicine in England.
Russia and Turkish: United Nations “not-readable”?
It was a genius that ended the crisis.
The Russian Leaders and Turkish joined their hands and announced the formal end of eight months of long vocational wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin admitted a Turkish antistrain in the surface balls in Petrohrad, I had to know that Ankara wants to use this more.
It's got hands, yeah.
But Putin wasn't excited, and a lot of him was surrounded, and it was also according to its measured standards.
Recep Tayip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his “beloved friend ” Mr. Putinov - five times as one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relationships with the Russian will not only return to their level before the crisis, but they will be better.
The next day one of the local news wrote that Erdogan had been doing as no evil happens.
According to me, his overseer was a proper tracking.
But the overliving hungry that was struck out of Putina showed that the Russian leader didn't forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his executive words: The Turkish battle aeroplane on Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was so weird.
Putin ran around herself, and Ankara convinced that Moscow's neck was cut down.
The worst was greater than it came from the other friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, maybe even impossible.
The Russian public measure was also amended since December.
In the state of controlled media after month, she led a massive total campaign against Ankara.
It seemed like Turkish could be done for everything.
It was more important to convince the supervisory representatives that Erdogan’s own family had benefits from illegal trade with a role in the parts of the controlled Member State of the Islamic State.
That's what he's done.
But in Petrobahad, the official message came that it is time to move.
The end of this meeting was only because Putino had been forgiven by President Erdogan.
Russia could also tell how to win.
Ankara's offers are clearly clear.
Firstly, Erdogan was the last month during the unexpected puzzle at least delivered power, and therefore he needs all his friends.
Reacted terrorist attacks in Turkey were visiblely explored.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian sanks had a significant impact - especially the disruption of charter aircraft that transforms a number of millions of Russian tourists on the north of Turkey.
This number was reduced at least 90 %.
If it is about Russia, the tour of operators and the charter companys will be achieved in the case of a year's refrigeration.
They're on the middle-shirt road in the end of the sezon.
Even this week, the State TV has promised more fair fruits and green, until the import of agricultural comades from Turkey will be authorised.
“Turists there, the rackets back here, ” as it reported in the News Vedemost.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is wounded on the West for what he thinks about the chae reaction to try to turn back.
Furthermore, long-term conversation about entering into the EU and entering Putin, which will smooth after to use and overcome Turkey's way with the West.
The Russ Leader was sure that he received a bonus point when Ankara asked her to help the elected authorities after trying to steal.
You have to understand that for Moscow, who has deep fear of the change of the mode, it is given.
So the summit in this imminente, maritime rules of Russia and Turkey allowed me to imagine what one of the analytics described as “the unleavenable association of the unleavened”: as the forces of two countries that feel to be denied and used by the West.
On the other hand, the major differences are among these two countries.
First is Syria, where Moscow has recently been set in the role of peacework, but where Russia and Turkish are standing on the sides of the areas.
It should be said that, after at least three hours, the President of the Print Conference, they were not mentioned or mentioned about this question.
The Turkish President expressed urgent response to the question on the differences between them while Putin decided to exit these differences.
There is no clear agreement, based on the basis of which both States could find a common word in the question of Syria.
But after months of open enemy - and in view of the risk of simple catastrophes, when the NAT Turkish member shot the Russian battle air - it is really better that both leaders talk to at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappeared for contacts outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS should be attached to the role back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for the clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan said the BBC Scotland state that the RBS tag was connected to global bank emotions.
She fled from them when she had almost been arrested for eight years ago and had to be busy.
At that time, the loss marks used “RBS” to protect other consumer financial tags.
There were millions of books based on the international sport sponsoring, from the Sex United Nations ragby championate after Winbledom Andy Marray.
But now it was decided that it's better to give more to the national marks.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used in the Scotland customers, but will not start new trades.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, except centres and encoding actions, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank has already been used for registers in Ireland and North Ireland.
There are other, smaller tags for private banks that will get more to the front - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
In the way to the lawyers and employees in Inverness-shire McEwan replied to the question of Ross McEwan.
The BBC Scotia state said: "RBS is stopped to be our investors' mark and mark for which our employees work, because we are more bankmarks now."
Since the bank was a global mark, it became a global mark and RBS.
Now I say we have no global aspiration, we have experienced at home scene.
Each of these marks will mean something very different in their own communities, and our workers will work under these tags.
RBS has already stated that it would not continue to continue in its consistency of the Sex Nation Shampionate, prepared a profile of a single sponsoring sport.
“It's not a appropriate time to move to the bank, because the basic question (which we are) is how to take place to become better bank for the lawyers?", the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we would say we would be a great bank for the recorders and those tags.
But together with the way we were looking for the needs of the customers, and not on our own, I think it's a lot of changes.
We can remember these tags again, I think that the right time has arrived.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket at the chair Predilection brought to the target 3000.
Dettor discharges the champagne after his double winning in Newmarket brought 3000 winnings
Frankie Dettori's kidnapped 3000 winnings in Newmarket.
This milk has received his other winning yesterday on his local trait - on the horse of Predilection who treated John Gosden.
The Fifty-fifty-year Ital is a six-year-shooter that resulted in the rovine gains.
His chiefs are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triangle champion of Dettori, who first won the Ghayar horses, said, "It's special."
I'm very busy because my family is here.
I'm not surprised that it came to Newmarket because I just got a thirty years ago.
It's not a great action, it's not Royal Ascot -- it's a fifth night on the earth with 20 000 people.
I'm very grateful.
Dectors gather gratulates when Predilection leads after winning
Two chickens of this milk got in the override gains - shempion, Richard Johnson, and a 20-year-old champion at the pension of Sir Anthony McCoy, who brought up more than 4300 winters during his carriers.
Lester Piggott, Nineteenth Weapon of Derby, 4 493 winds in the carrier
Frankie is one of the best modern-times, and it's not surprising that he got a milk that only got a few leaders before him.
It's style and strong, but it's just his taktic fistron that separates him from the other leaders in the ship.
He's a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his supervision and charism applied fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom, that if he wouldn't just have been in the weeks and a big guest, he would have already six thousand winds!
Of course, the truth is that Frankie led a victory in the United Kingdom in the largest part of his 30-year carriers, and that's really something.
He's a living mind that's good for the British getting sport, but it's more important that it's an incredible sport.
Frankie Dettori declared his success by his public year-by-school
From the age of finishes after a late school - Frankie Dettori was a poster of the British rovine ships of two decades.
It was like a ship on the mountain road.
The increasing number of wines of great convictions, including his known “seconds seven” in Ascot. He also survived the aircraft and had the command of starting for drugs.
Three years ago, he stayed first when he returned after six months of launch, but showed an incredible internal force and all the mistakes returned to the best form.
And maybe it's not the last -- Dettori had already announced that he would like to continue in the least to 50 years.
Russian President Putin allowed the chief of the President office Sergei Ivanova
The Russian President Vladimir Putin left Sergei Ivan from the boss of the president's office.
Ivanov was one of the neighborest Putin cooperators after many years.
Thirty-seventy-year-old Ivanov was called a special representative for ecological and transport.
In the statement of Kremlu, Putin “lifted Ivan from his head of the Russian President's office, ” but it was not mentioned.
His place will be transmitted by Anton Vajno, who was the leader of Ivan since 2012.
40-year-old Vain was diplomatic.
He was born in the main city of Estonia Tallinna in 1972, promoted the prestigious State institution of international relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked on the campaign in Tokyo.
On web pages (in Russia), he states that he later made the boss of the President Protocol and the president officer.
At the name of Putino, he said: "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important tasks of administratives are to support your activities of the State's head in the meaning of the proposal of laws and controls of your views.
Putin on the fifth of the Russian TV station showed that Ivanov requested her to release from the post and recommended to replace him just Vain.
Revealing dreams?
This step was totally mystified by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was along with one of the neighborest partners of Vladimira Putina and the same as Putin worked for KGB.
As the chief of the president officer was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At the meeting with the President Putin, who has published the State TV, both men declared that the chief of the President's office would go to its own request.
But the dreams in the camera were just a few few people - especially now, in the presence of Parliament's choices.
So, is it about the consequence of a fight about power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that the man who had ever considered as a possible president would like to lead a Russian environmental policy, was meeting with great unbelief.
On the Cremlu pages, the notes defined by Putino, which Ivan indicates: “I was true that in 2012 I have asked you to talk to me this very annually post, even if I would have been talking about a problem post, he was raised for four years.
As it seems, I was the chief of the president office four years and eight months.
Ivanov held his post in proceeding 2011.
He was maintaining the functions of the Government and the Ministry of Protection before.
It is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of 90 years, when Putin's great Federal Service for Russian Federal Security (FSB), which replaced KGB, was named Ivanov.
When Putin came to the power, Ivan was one of his five neighborhoods.
His time was even speculated that Ivanv could be an advice of Putin in the family of the state after its second election period, because the third time would be contrast for Putin.
But this post took another neighborhood of Putin's co-operator Dmitry Medvedav.
Putin came back to the President's office for only three and half years later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series of criminal thoughts, was released after what the register had done.
The last month in Los Angeles Gibson was attached to the physical exchange of views on the scene.
The ABC and CBS television stations that produce the series have been announced in the common statement of its authorisation.
Gibson, who played the special agent Aaron Hotchner, was excused in the fourth month before the announcement of his exhibition.
It's been achieved with creative differences on the scene and independence.
I'm sorry that it's done," he said in the statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television stations, Gibson's position is deleted from the series that follows the storys of the FBI agents, about something later.
Four-four-four-fifty-year-year-old heritage, which has pronounced the main role in the Dharma and Greg site, has effected in the series since the first series in 2005.
“ I love the thoughts of criminals and in the last twelve years I gave them heart and soul, ” Gibson brought Gibson in his statement that he gave in the fifth.
I hoped that I'd be in him until the end, but that's not possible now.
I would still want to express my thanks to the authors, producers, heroes, our wonderful team, and especially the great fans, in which this show could hope.
The return of the series to the twelve series is expected on September 28.

Kevin Bain thinks that 75 fish fish can be a single branch that left the water dead there.

Queensferry Crossing: Now connects to Fife
The project for 1,35 billion books must be completed to May 2017
Ingegners connected the north desktop and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - most now connects to Fife.
It is therefore about the first of the four confidence between the “believers of the plots ” which are now at least completed around each of the three pillons of the monkey.
The part of the monkey from Fife is now 600 meters long and weights 30 000 tons.
It's in her 10 000 tons of ferry and 20 000 tons of beton and 46 grass.
The project for 1,35 billion books must be completed to May 2017.
The Economic Secretary Keith Brown has visited the building today and was among the first ones who came from the wall on the bridge.
He said: “This is historical time and the symbolic time of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnesses of how structural engineers used more than 300,000 tons of beton and achieved to build this part of the monster.
In the middle of massive dimensions and the massage of the monkey was the end of the conference between the viadute and the delicate monster, which required an extraordinary excessive excessiveness.
In its place, more than 79% of the whole monster desktops, beton for the last parts of the board is now departed in Rosytha, so the entire board is prepared to uphold on the bridge.
Michael Martin, leader of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The main confidence in the establishment of each monster is always an important milk.
In this wonderful project, this conclusion represents the branch of the ground stability.
After installing the last part of the motor boards and its connection to the extension of the North Tower, then we had to close the last space on the north side - direction on the pevnin.
We did this by the protest of the north nearby travel of 700 millimeters in the south.
This was massive and currently very delicious operation.
The massive because the viaduct is a long 222 meters, amounts about 6 000 tons and it was required to be carried out at about 3 %.
Delicately because the tolerance with the team was very small - only a few milimeters every direction.
Everything went very well to be happy.
Safety in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy they are alive"
Three men are "happy that they are alive" after they broke water from their fishing ships in England.
Moelfre RNLI's safe staff reported the ranks at Friday at 13:20 of the British airport after the incident in Moelfre had seen.
All three men tried to pay safe, while their member continued unregisteredly.
“ We have seen their neighborhood in their neighborhood and it's the worst, ” said the guarder of Moelfre Vince Jones.
“The strong wind turned away from them before we have gone out,” he added.
Two men saved the local fishing ship, the third man in the age of 60 was found without saving clothes broken as they keep the battle.
All were submitted to the border of the Safety Member State and returned to the Station of Safety Members.
Jones said: “Thre men who are in the water are happy that they are alive and are completely without destruction.
The ship engine had a lana for the noise disappearing, but somebody came to his offset from the person who was guided by the member when it came to convert.
Somebody shocked on those holes, keeping the protective hand.
Judge refuses to resolve the case because of the Tluchor's wife.
Peter Tluchor is one of the three messengers who had to be inquired to get from the Premier Netem and his next captain John Nagy's political trafic, so Lucrative post for political procedure.
In 2012, the payment package was approved.
Snajdr, Fuxs and Tluchor allowed him with their reactions.
Then they discovered the impact beds in the state firms.
It was therefore the subjects of the table, and they ended a month in the construction.
But according to the court, it was unrighteous, and it was expected to be totally 2 million corners.
The plot now comes as a witness, and it is after the Supreme Court of Justice.
His wife works in the Court Building on the Flower Market and solves civil sports.
However, he wants to be the court of Helena King's career (see the criminal issues - not. red.) and to submit to the potential measures.
There will be such a case that will be obviously obviously to be concerned with another rule of judiciary.
However, the King has made the sins of John Immediately, before Nagius.
It was about the details of the use of military discussions to monitor the first wife of the Premier In time of Radky.
In this case, Tluchor didn't figure out.
According to the lawyer of Jaroslav Ortman, it's about reactions too excessive.
I think that the instantness can't be made such as to excuse the judgment if the witnesses have a wife or a relative in the court.
I'm afraid it wouldn't be judged anyway, he recognised for the journal.
"I think it's a worst," he added.
In the case of political trafic, Roman Bočak, an old officer is also accused.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, the accidental ship would have a chance to succeed.
The Executive Court for Praha 1 proposed the 13th June requirement of the leadership of the Premier Peter Negative Jan Nagyy (day-time) and other offended in the case of the use of the military report.
It's a photograph of the Intime with a husband to judge.
The plot had to solve the comments about Parautko.
For example, the husband had to judge the statements of President Milosche Zeman on the Democratic Premier News of Ferdinand Perutko.
Zeman told him that he was sympathy with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schools is dead!
The girl, of course, has been departed in the aircraft of connection forces.
To Syria, with her two old friends, a lonelier left a lonely from the London Airport Gatwick.
The British Ministry has not commented the report on her death.
The young Londonians who fled from the house were held secretly transferred to Syria through the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana married the media after their other old company from the London school Bethnal Green Academy.
The event of the lone has called a serious field of attention and also in the relationships between British and Turkey.
The British Security Directors say that there were about 600 British Muslims from about 50 young women and girls.
The series of them have been linked to the radicals of IS and other groups.
Those who return home are representing a terroristic threat for the British.
The work of dreams for hundreds of money.
Great work you don't need a high school.
So it looks like the first look of the work of the guy.
And often the second.
The expenditure is not only for the Chess' measures extremely high pay (in Prace you work in IT to 180 000 Kč), but also extreme costs.
It's the reason that the IT specialists are a serious deficit.
There's no thousand specialists.
In Germany, at least 20 000 IT specialists are missing.
The most viewed is the statistics of the Grafton Personal Agency programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between some of the work offers.
It is therefore not sufficient to candidate the work position, but the employment position on candidates, comments Jitka Sučk, the marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't needed.
The high school education is therefore not for the needs of employees.
High school education means a good basis and is a complete indicator of intelligence and education of candidate, but often does not have a common power to know the development.
The developers have to be still learned new things that a high school is not played once, says Peter Cubačk, Director Monster Career CZ.
It's the best thing to do in Prae.
The grounds of the cities are moved up higher than the republic media.
At the most money they're coming to Prace and Brna, it's not already such a hitparad in the regions.
"Work conditions in Brna are comparable to those players," confirms Kubač.
In the highest section, the technical directors will be achieved.
In Prague and Brna can come to 120 000 - 180 000 Kč.
In other regions, there is a lower payment, but there is not more than 800,000 Kč.
Reviews are also IT project managers.
At the income, they can make 60 000 - 100 000 Kč.
Get them, and it's absolutely.
While in some professional professions, sometimes it is not paid to the office of work.
If the companies have to be transferred and transferred from other companies, they will like to get a solvent.
They can actually resurrect him according to their own.
They won't go without a language.
The knowledge of the strange language is in every profession, but in the towns, it is needed to be a minimum fulfill English.
The knowledge of at least one strange language is in some IT positions of need.
On the other hand, we meet the number of cases when the companies are looking for an extraordinary and experienced person, and only with the average English knowledge.
However, if, for example, the supporter controls more external words, it is interesting for his employee because he can serve more employees from different countries, he adds Director Cubač.
Jonah in Googlu, there's a paradise.
It's just silent to employees in Googla.
Of course, it is a permanent work time for them, the possibility of work from home or various disagreements, not only for moms.
"The newspapers offers the company four weeks to be allowed, more after the birth of the child," says Martin Jonek, speaker of Google.
Experience also increases health care for employment and family, training, transport, school, wellness or massy directly on work.
Whoever wants to learn is green and doesn't depend on what news wants to learn.
But the costs are not finished.
Such full driving driving is also decisively not to deal with.
The healthy food (in some localities and lunch and evening) is available every day.
Furthermore, in all officers, the microscopes called where people always find healthy, they're talking about.
And to get nothing out, so what's wrong, gives it to the box that employees can take home evening.
And the causes of the Czech's incredible expenditure?
Creating creative and motivant environments!
"For Google, it is not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," adds.
The Office of the United Nations crisised Bulgaria for the criminalization of the surface.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, Commander of the United Nations for Human Rights, convinced in the fourth of Bulgaria that systematically disturbs human rights of criminalization.
The Office Strategy of Bulgarian Government "invokes serious concerns in respect of that Bulgarian does not obtain international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in the statement.
He noted that "it is especially concerned to be a witness of how important and influential public persons express public support for criminal weapons whose trees are ordering horns on the border between Bulgarian and Turkey."
"I'm going from the most important problems is that at least all people who go to Bulgarian fields are automatically affected," said Zeid.
And what's worse -- sometimes they're threatened and prisoned - for a year or long - if they're trying to go out of the land.
Their trials to go out of the country are criminalized, in particular, in accordance with the international law, the right to depart from any country, including its own.
Bulgaria has 14,000 migrants, 21,000 missions for the same time.
Pokemon Go - Honba for health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.
Number of people during the last decades says that the teengers and children are no longer playing out and give the presence of the training of the free time before the screens.
Pokemon Go brings people out of the ship and leads them to the active.
Time scaned before the screens with originally killed on the TV, later on video games and the most recent on smart phones.
It's amazing to see that technologies and activities are not involved outside.
Of course, I speak of the way Pokemon Go, the application based on staffs that first appeared in the video games at the end of 90 years (and later occurred the draft series, playing cards and others).
As well as in many cultural fenomenes, this new game has arrived before the beginning of June in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then deposited because of the potential interest that led to overcome the servers.
Poquemon Go received a few days more users than Tinder and almost much users like Twitter.
How does that work?
Shortly, players on a smart phone will go out to search Pokemons who monitor GPS, and when they find them, they can 'foot' (the Screenshot on the phone) or 'that'.
I have gathered a generation that played in the younger age, brings her out of the seat and a woman out to look for Pokemons.
In the United States, this game has come to the expression number of steps that a "medium" person will do each day.
Cardiogram for a clear hour from Applu, which seeks 35 000 users recently for Washington Post, declared that during two days since the start of the game, the number of watched people who were watched each day after 30 minutes went from 45 to 53 per cent.
The Community does not have information about who Pokemon Go plays - sees only several data on levels.
A lot of public campaigns that encourage people to find "30", "they'd be taken from the gaucher" and "they were active every day" falling into unnatural grounds because most of the public health messages are nugged and certain people who don't look well.
However, the importance of refugee should not be highlighted.
Those who rule regularly reduce the risk of the disease in a skin or depression.
Physical activity is involved in the control of substance, high blood pressure, sugar and long list of offers that we can't be able to entire.
But the beautiful game Pokemon expects him that people go out and do something that's crazy.
So you hide three pills of health - moves, smooth air and sun-shirt pairs.
Some people even get new friends at the honour.
As soon as it is, they will, of course, find the dads of nuts who seek any lock to be able to suffer.
And yeah, somebody can go into the door.
What, like?
He got a half.
In their time of application for smart phones, such as Fitbit, they had to watch our activity, but we didn't have reason to do something like this is in this game.
The news is looking at, and it's going to be interested in a certain moment.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokemons, there will be more games that will be combined with applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in the honour for activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles received gold in the multiboy of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the respiration.
Simone Biles is in the front of all this immunity.
It's dynamic on the shoot.
Nothing on the board.
They've got all on the simple ones.
Excellent in all.
And now, finally, an olympian champion.
The 19th-year-year-year-old American smoking went to the right road in a multiboy and the other on full lines under the olympian reflectors.
The total result of 62,198 confirmed clearly its smoking before the silver medical and the member of the "final fifty" Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronzo Medyalist Aliyou Mustafino.
Simone Biles (USA) in the fourth century during the shipment in the final multiple units in the sport range at the air-olympian games 2016 in Brazil Riu de Janir.
Billes became a fourth American in a series that won more balls, and the fifth totally, when she confirmed her news of her best nuts and might be the best of her generation.
When her full final assessment on the table and her long path was finished until this time, she appeared on her face of slides.
These successs set up it into the same lines of a single atleta's time, as Michael Phelps, who added a new size to their sport:
The Biles's sport for his last three years, he played 15 medals on world shadows - including 10 gold. Her constructions are ambition and exactness and olympical shadows from 1984 Mary Lou Retton's “the best dream as she had seen."
The last trial was waiting for her in Brazil, not between the Balesa and the rest of the conviction, but between her alone and severe expectations too much.
Anything else than returning home to your family to Spring in Texas with the full of gold medicals, would be considered as an excuse.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raismans are involved after the winning of gold and silver medal in the Final of Women's Multipower Unity on the aircraft olympian games 2016 in the Brazilian Riu de Janir in the fourth century.
The first Biles received a threat when he was as an exclamator in the front of the national team coordinators of Marthy Karoly.
The Biles continues to think that during her long way on the top of the buy was never looking forward, but it's not exactly true.
The part of her meetings in simple - that contains a typical triangle salto with double-profit - is set in Latin music that is just hours to home, outside the olympian rib in Riu.
That's not an agreement.
The girl adopted her birthday as a bottle, and her talent showed the mother of Aimee Boorman's treachers to the road where Boorman trained, and where he got power.
The ship in multiboy hasn't been played since 2013 - it's a range of winning that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Although Mustafin's moved on a short lead by two turns, it was just an iluze.
Kladyn and simple - where Biles's world championate - wait.
She came back to the chair with 15,433 points behind the board, and was cut down with 15,933 points in simple.
Raisman's little discovered her when they waited for the final scars - only formality - and around the thick red, white and blue skins, the Biles’s slides discovered when they were fulfilled as a small writer in the diary.
The Court of Raisman was so little payment for the olympian four years ago when she had been dealt with Mustafin's third case, but then her bronz was because of the number of three best meetings.
This time the two - twenty-year-old team captain of the Americans called "babča" was enough forward.
After her simples, she sent a driving balls to return, which sometimes has been insected.
For Bileso has an article that this ninety-year-year-year-old atlet this week put on Twitter, where it became a simple hite, was entirely a new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial murder were shooted in the audience of music in the car
According to the police reports published in the fourth, two women and girls died in 12 years during the greatest attack of the decade, in the case of the first series murder in Phoenix. They were shocked when they were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The Offices stated that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephen R. Ellis and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were struck on July 12th in the car parking on the coming road.
In the report, the army man was standing on the side of the company and broke out of the hand weapons eight morning, and then he shot in another car.
According to the police, there is no triangle murder, because the attacker had no money, nor the total of $2,900, which had one of the adult victims.
The police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that the investigators realize whether the shooting had no relationship with some of the previous four attacks.
In two overwhelming fourth of the Spanish four months, there were nine attacks in which seven people were killed and two other persons were destroyed.
"It's going to do in the village quarter before the house," Howard introduced this month for the KHO Station CBS.
The police thinks that the surprise used some cars, including the fat Nissana from the end of 90 years, the black BMW from the end of 90 years and the White Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to examine the evidence to conclude that the attacks were associated together and were carried out by the same murder.
Ellis (33) was transmitted to the hospital where he later had suffered his suffering.
Liner (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died in the place.
The police witness said that it wasn't usual that women were sitting in the parking car and listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the fire, which was once an empty addiction was only half an hour before the trial murder.
The investigators found the camps and the rest of the balls in the seat and the motor caps.
The mother of the sexy child with the microcephalie: "He has better"
Edmund Picciuto, as the most children of his age, loves songs, players, and of course also his mother.
But in the difference of their boarders, the microcephalie is the result of genetic pain that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during the depression.
When I first came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do that.
I'm not ready for this.
Whatever isn't true - of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, found that Edmund might never know and maybe he can't survive.
Some doctors even proposed to be placed in the setup.
“ My first reaction was that I thought people did not do this today, ” explains Picciut.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
He wasn't able to sit down until three years, and he's still not talking.
Some limits are already fulfilled.
He's coming with help and leading on the road.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and loves songs.
Elizabeth predicts the character word that Edmund says "come, sing me."
"We teach him a sign speaker," said Picciut for CBS News.
But it's not a regular word -- it says that Edmund has imagined some characters himself.
Microcephalie can be exceeded from a number of different states: genetics, such as it is in Edmund, and after infections in the infection of the viruses, such as scalders or Zika.
Symptoms and prognoses can be able to be cutting in a basic way.
It's too soon to tell us what effect will have Zik's virus on the lives.
The Picciut reminds the citative reward that will choose the future.
I still ask, "What will happen?"
What's going on?
And it's still not sure.
Actually, I never asked what's the whole prognosis because I don't expect someone to tell me that.
But Picciut has an emergency report for the mothers of all children who suffer the natural weights of Zik.
The situation is better.
You know it'll be better.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.

Mahaj Brown (6) - "Shooter shooter as a shooter," survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, he was assaulted in Philadelphia six hundred horses, and this week is a second shot on the child in the age of six years in the city.
Her birthdays identified her for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
Proverbs say that the boy has suffered several shots, including slambin, feet, feet and smoke, but when he was in the hospital, he was in knowledge.
“ He had a terrible power, his small body was broken as a solution, ” said his grandfather, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe that.
The boy's in a critical situation in the hospital and he's understood a few operations.
The family for the staff said that the boy should be healed.
He had to go to the first class of basic schools.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were killed in the Germantown part.

Two more victims were not in the car and the police tried if some of the crazy men could be a shooter.
CBS Philadelphia investigators said that it was probably a shooting between some armed men.
In the place, the camps were found from the guns of a fucking type, with a variety of avoided weapons.
I'm sure it's been fully about the continuing battle.
On the street, there were ships on both sides of the traveller.
So it seems that there were some weapons armed persons who were actively attached," he brought for the staff of the Captain of Fildelph Police Anthony Ginaldi.
A number of houses and vehicles were also built in the area.
Nobody has been arrested and the police explores videos from the camera.
Next six-year-old kid, this girl, was shooted in a damn shooting shooter in the house of West Oak Lane.
The girl is repeated and the police still looks for a surprise.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie?
I'm just like to imagine a female team to the aircraft olympian games, and it's just some reasons.
First, I was in every air olympian since 1984 and the United States were never so dominant.
And the second: In this team there are three shoes, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is hungry to put this team, which adds Aly Raisman, which is the Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also approved the presentness of the black and Latin Americans on the sport.
The genetic number one in the four-year-old years was a African.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and the second boy.
That means something.
At the last olympian, Gabby Dougals was surprised to become a shampion olympian herd and the America's smoking.
Now the world could be a testimony of the incredible exercise of the trineous world winds of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, which had been unexpected but mysterious magnitudes.
On Friday, Simone became a fourth American who received gold in a woman’s multiboy.
And the member of the team Aly Raisman got the money.
We're witnesses of the sport, but in the hours of the land, it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie sold the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are "final fifth" because the team of the next olympian games will be based only from four atleta, and this is the last year when Marta Karolya treasures.
But the fact is that the gymnastic is financially an annual sport and dining treat overwhelming in private gemnastic clubs that maintain parents who pay the costs for training, building, training, dress, packs, hotel residence (for training and their conviction and family). And it is not far.
Most of these sport clubs are in rich areas of business that can support activities.
In these clubs, all training treasures and for families of magnitude and magnitude are involved on the cost and long obligations.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles trainer, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez trainer, both trained athletes during the time they started in the gymnast.
It is our responsibility to bring trenic treasures that are more available and accessible communities without number of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I've based 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer a weakness of harm or low costs in Harlem for more than 15 000 young people in the field of the city (former black and Spanish origin), and we trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (mi born town) where we will provide quality magnitude to young people who serve the opportunity to learn and to take care of this great olympian sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, intensity and coordination of the body and hard work, disciple and decisive thoughts.
This combination means useful benefits for good health, success in school and work.
The inspiration of this team will be sent to us thousands of young girls who will want to make a magnitude, and that's great.
The participation of this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, because you have shown the " girl's power" and you won the olympical teams of gold, and I thank you for motivating a lot of young girls all the origins to be in the way with healthy, strong and successful women.
After refusing the proposal of Jeremy Hunt, young doctors are ready to enter the other stages
The Ministers hoped that after the concluding of the transformed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the Treaty was rejected.
Hunt in July disappeared the plans to conclude the agreement with that NHS was in the “nobody” country, and another afternoon would have an increasing impact on employment and patients.
First young doctors have already signed a new agreement that includes changes in night and week work procedures for improvement of disagreement in non-social hours.
The doctor Ellen McCourt, President of the Commission for young doctors in the report last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns on the proposed contract, especially in the meaning that the current crisis of work forces will be achieved and then to be held with all doctors.”
Eight weeks before the first group of doctors passes under the new contract, it is necessary to get progress and get time.
The BMA efforts for the solution of sports through the exhibition were meeting with unexpected introduction of Dr. and often with a sensitive silence from the government's side.
And this is the promise of Jeremy Hunt from the past month that this option is still opened.
“Jeremy Hunt must now be treated, throwing out and resolving the fear of young doctors.”
If it doesn't happen, young doctors are ready to carry further steps.
During the last stairs at the end of April, at least 13,000 rutin operations and 100 000 visits were invited, because sisters and specialists were invited to reach the doctors who were among the protestants.
The Ministers hoped that after the concluding of the transformed agreement, the British Medical Association (BMA) would be concluded on the amendments.
BMA wants more payment for weekly work for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, President of NHS employees, called young doctors to not go into any stage.
Mortimer said: “The boat action will be only a little or nothing, but the press will come on so difficult teams and services and growing fears, disturbation and disorder for patients, careing personal and their families."
In the past two months, we worked with the Council of young doctors and with the Health Minister and others, positively responding to them in respect of the role of supervision and information.
The employees hoped that continued positive introduction in other important issues - such as the efforts, flexibility in schools, other education for those who return after a disruption of carriers, costs for schools, the recognition of objectives, study freedom and difference between the heads - was exactly as the serious employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health Health Health Health Health Health and the Minister of Health Health Agreement Agreement Agreements that BMA had agreed in the list, and notice.
Medicine for 60 corns per day can reduce infringement risks
Thousands of patients infected will be able to use medicine that stands around 60 corns (2 libres). The authorities recommend to give it more patients after a longer time.
The medicine against the blood of Ticagrelor reduces people with the heart’s disease that will be reached.
The medicinal product is now given after the infringement is given for 12 months to reduce the danger of death or other rescue.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine should be given to people for four years to reduce the dangers of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends to be given to people for four years to further reduce cardiovascular problems.
In England, almost 140,000 people and fourth of them will continue to safeguard or heart mortality.
Infarct and deaths are made by the storage of the arterial walls, which creates a compatible layer.
If it is possible to decline this layer, it may be caused to cause blood smoking, blowing blood access to heart and cardiac infarc.
If the fuel is free, the blood speaking can continue, lock blood in the brain and make the brain dead.
People who have already sold infarct are designed to be a higher risk of another reserve.
Ticagrelor, who produces the British AstraZeneca and sold it under the trade name of Brilique, reduces the risk that it is less probable.
In the proposal of the NICE Directive, which has been published today, recommends that patients get 90 mg ticgrelor after 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, and that is twice a day after another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NCE Health Technology Assessment, said: “In the case of the efficient secondary preventive treatment there are four patients who had infarcts and who will have another heart saving or death - often with disasters.”
Repeat fear may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
It is indicated that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is efficient in reducing the dangers of other heart safeguards and deaths in people who have already infected.
We're happy that we can extend the possibilities of treatment that are available for many thousands of people who will use it.
Because information on the efficiency and security of Ticagrelor - especially on blood risk - over three years are limited, it is not recommended in the proposal of treatment over this time.
The computer culture began to exceed in Muslim areas
The old city of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was called last year from the function because of corruption, which was linked to the government report
Political correction culture has been carried out to supervise broadcasts in Muslim communities, today in the Government report.
The ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles is criticising police, choice inspectors and racists because they ignored the use of volunteers because of the “privilege of ethics and religion”.
The first secretary of the community, now the governor of anticorruptical principles, said that the fear of the volunteers on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons before the choice rooms and the scattered volcators.
He allowed the choices to take the evidence of identity with themselves and to show who they are.
In the present time the electorer is enough to enter his name and address.
In the report, it is further proposed to a single person when the vote is exceeding an immoral inquiry to make it possible that someone will vote twice.
Whistlebloods should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the pressure may be greater access to documents of meetings and decisions adopted by non-official committees or group works.
“It is not only one of the protection against the choices, but also on the protection of local governments from the largest corruption and financial income,” he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scenario in Tower Hamlets in West London.
In the long-term year, the special election court decided that the governor of the city of Lutfur Rahman should be revoked from his position after condemnation of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court considered that Rahman had “cinickly threatened” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and declined his critics with racism and islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his word, “with his campaign to be religious obligations of the Muslims to vote for him. ”
When 300 voices were discovered or as the result of the reality, when a person votes and gives it to somebody else.
Sir Eric showed that there are evidence of conduction in the whole country.
He expressed special concerns on the grounds in the corespondency voting - that the older members of the Muslim community during the time he developed a pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations to clear the optional system, including transmission of the evidence of identity.
His report states: “I had been submitted to evidence that on the ransom members of some ethnic minors, especially women and young men, was exhausted to vote according to the desire of elders, and in particular in the communities that come from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"It was afraid that... the State institutions had avoided such eye because of the "politically correct" rebellion against the ethnic origin and religion."
Mr Eric had submitted 50 recommendations to clear the system, including that political activists should be prohibited to manipulate with the corresponding voices and to prevent the “reporting of votes”.
The report currently valued Theresa May is also required to reject the use of the optional lists for immigration doses and doses.
Consider the opportunity to request the choices to provide evidence of identity before the vote.
Using an insectable inspection to a simple person in voting to show that someone will call twice.
The implementation of systematic national controls of persons to ensure that they can call.
Requirements for automatic corresponsional vote to limit for three years.
Disable political attorneys and activityists to manipulate the exclusive corresponsional voices and choices.
Give the police the right to create around the choice rooms of the cordon.
Change the laws to be easier to smooth persons who exercised unjustly in accordance with the reform law from 1983.
Disable photos in choice rooms.
Only English (excluding Wales) are required to work in choice rooms.
Send schools and ensure that the workers keep the rules that the choice cabin walks individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says that it's "wunderful" that, in the case of Tower Hamlets, no offence was taken from criminal acts.
“The question of the choice excluded Lutfura Rahman and his agent for the Lithanian Corruption and the illegal practices,” said.
A number of reasons was considered guilty on the frame of the reasonable doubts - in the power of evidence of criminal action.
It also criticizes the unexpected "control of locking boxes" in the separations for the registration of phones on the railway.
Sir Eric said: “The lonely court decision in the case of Tower Hamlets.
Our nation has a horrible link to the democracy of Parliament, but it is concerned and hidden to extend choices and the status of refusing certain authorities of these reputants.

How to protect the attack of the weapons through Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com could be safe for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a very federator of Krav Magy sitting in New York, to find how to join the weapons of weapons at the near distance.
This video will show you how to get this over the violent overseer, to come close to you before or back.
If he's close to you behind, he says Mizrachi, then the first thing you need to do is to turn back to see your traveller and "they have a free train of shoes."
Then you will understand the weapons between your front and the branches before you set it in the face of a free place.
Then he follows the ring into the slide, and while the steaker blows in the pains, you cut him the weapon out of his hand, you throw it into the face, and you'll start to access, then you will keep the weapon on him.
If the armed man is near to you, it's like the technology - get your body out of the palm line, take the weapons and cover it so that the gift can't shoot.
Give the weapons to the weapons and shoot the shooter into the horse, then shoot the weapon out of his shooting and start to access, still look at it.
Does it sound hard?
Look at the video where you're going to see exactly what Mizrach does.
But don't forget that the most dangerous way of getting out of the surface - if you're not a very mysterious Krav Maga - is to make all the preparations.
Instaurant Ian Wright is the most deepest place in Europe to the travel manager
The British traveller decided to make a hard test of his immunity system and a long-term reflex - the olyzation of the most poor and the latter places in Europe.
Moderator and author of Ian Wright (51), origin of Suffolk, in the evidence of the power of his immunity system, looked on his language of the euro bank, boarded on Piccadilly Circus, the  button rolled on the toalet in the ball and the Russian public phone.
Before all the subjects, he used lightmeters to show himself and to us all that is going on.
Experience based on the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, he brought interesting results.
It's not possible to increase the bottom of plots used by thousands of other people, but in the cook tree, it's actually much more cold bacteria.
Ian Wright, during his whole way after Europe, talked with doctors and specialists in health in the strength of the battery of the air flowers and his own health.
Successfully, nothing of his oil was left in his mouth worse than the damn.
Ian Wright was exclaimed by testing his difference on the paths around the world and to eat wonderful and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested its immunity system - from public traveling on the flow stations after the floor
In a movie that touched it, he says: “I had no power in my health since my childhood, and I gave me everything possible, from the eating of red and bathroom waters."
He confirmed his reputator in his film.
The only thing he refused was the springs of public in Russia.
After a simple star of lightnometer, he showed more than 4000 units.
For comparison, the low wise hands should be less than 60.
One of the public challenges in Russia but refused to refuse after his lightmeter showed more than 4000 units, while the pure wise hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Financial manufacturers of milk products Valio touched the traveler film with the name The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of battery in various places, such as in the bucket
In a movie he said, "This is almost the worst thing I felt on the west."
Nothing worse than this!
I'm not gonna have anything, because it's incredible here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was involved in cooperation with the Financial Manufacturer of Milk Products Valio.
Wright's community offered a preparation for Valio Gefilus, which contains the bacteria of milk cylines and vitamins C and D, which helps people to strengthen the smoking battery and immunity system.
Niko Vuorenma, Vice-President of Valio's company for obstacles, juices and new category, said: “We wanted to offer the consumers something really new.
Something they'd seek to be able to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We have thought of a lot of false ideas that have finished by the idea of "Let's call Ian."
It says that the interest of the health of the stress is a global phenomenon.
Instead of speaking only about products, we wanted to give them to larger consciences - good and bad bacteria in our entire environment, health care and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growth of health care is the global phenomenon and through this document we have brought the consumers a interesting way of information.
I also think it's a great sense for humor!
Tom Hakla, whose movie rejoiced, adds: "Let's say so, Ian would lose my respect if he would have gone something of what I wanted after him - as if the rare Russian business that appears in the movie."
Some things were more easier for Ian, and others were very difficult.
I'm happy that we've got some of these scenarios."
The Valio Community carried out in 2015 an investigation, according to which 84% of the respondents had driving the bactery of hydrates, especially with the health of injury and steel, and 58% of the responsibility showed that, at least, the products contained in addition to oxide.
The family of socially needed before exhaustion decreased the general building in Saltash City in Cornwallu

After their strong exhaustion from the house, the officers of the animal type were shocked when they discovered that the ability is located in the air condition.
There were trees, the basic crisis was broken, everywhere on the ground was warned, and the walls were numbered.
The family has already been departed and has lived in private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, the director for the issues in the company of Cornwall Housing showed that she had a fear to save the house.
She said: “For people here it was a nightmare, and I don’t think people should live so.
It must be considered a number of circumstances, because this impossible is, at least, into the conscience as "not even a beautiful part" Cornwallu.
This family is unfortunately known and their names are unfortunately known.
A couple has three sons in the house of sometimes, and the police stated that the rhythmic government that the family was employed was a lot of bits with the use of baseball patterns, the fear of circuit citizens, the use of drugs, the distribution of drugs and the voice crying, the challenges and the reliefs.
The Skeldon (47) named in the respective contract was made in June a penalty for anti-social behavior.
In some rooms in the house that may be built, they were found a rear disaster.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the basic crisis was broken
The companions say they saw them on the street like a pit, and they regularly called the police.
The company Cornwall Housing was her and her partner who violated the house this week after they received a additional period of 11 weeks to go freely.
The companions of the complaints were exhausted with the fact that their lives were living in the hell.
One of them said: "They were not aware of anyone."
We lived near them 20 years, and it was always like that.
How many times we saw the police here, it can't be counted.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence -- we're not normal!
It's gonna be fine when they're finally gone.

It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extremely and their actions, according to the witness, had to shame her neighbors.
I assume all the work that he sent my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall and the members of the local communities who were fully informed of us.

The half of the sepulchre services does not hold the provisions.
The half of the tomb service providers does not hold legal provisions.
The Chess trade inspection (CHOI) found it in controls in the second fourth year.
Several services in accordance with it are most often not informed of the rest of their prices or do not provide a written confirmation on the exchange of units.
The CHOI has set 41 rate in total 73,000 corners.

Inspectors detected the surprises at 47 of 95 controls.
In addition to non-price information and failure confirmation of certain sepulchre services also sold products or provide services for other prices than was agreed.

It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schools who had gone from London to connect to IS, died in Siria.
The director Tasnime Akuniee said that her family had learned about her death in Syrian Rakce a few weeks ago.
ITV News, on fourth, announced that it was probably killed during the Russian aircraft attack in Rakce, which is a basic group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family she died just at the moment she was prepared to escape from the war of the successful country and to return to the British.
“ The man wants to believe that the only goodness of all these things - as a message and excuse for others that these are real dangers connected to the way to war zones - is that they turn people away from when they decided, ” said Akuniee.
Sultana and two other schools from the east part of London arrived in 2015 to the airport to Turkey and then to the bus to the border of Siria.

Leader in the Senat of the Democratic part of Harry Reid says that it is convinced that the candidate of President's elections for the Democracy Hillary Clinton named the judge Merrick Garland in the highest court in his election.

Where's winyl: who really buys graphphone disks?
Vinyl loves men in the middle age.
Before you decide the sections of the comments to pay the perpetual notes under the writer NeAssemblyMusiVeMedium, we are sure that this exhibition will go out of the real data.
According to YouGov, so many discussions of the graphphone deceases are not connected to the booms of miles who want to love the originality of physical property, but with the nest of the middle age.
Those who buy the album in the recent times are probably people in the age between 45 and 54 years.
Young people in 18-24 are at least likely.
It does not actually beyond the smoking of the surface fanus - it's all the emotional size: old people who buy graphphone disks, they probably want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are pleasant to themselves (69% versus 66%).
But youGov's real results?
If this blog was broken as a television reporter, she would have seen me as a camera, as I carried out to the road streets in Soho, clothed into the decent seventh clothes and the width of the gesticling. Then I'd stop, I'd put his hand out and said something authorised as, "We'll see it."
So let's see it.
While the heart of Soho is shortly eliminating his sharm and cooling - buildings contained independent soldiers, now are filled with hotels, restaurants and foods, conflicts and office requirements - a number of fantastic specialized businesses with gramophone deals remained.
Maybe I'd like to ask a camera to stop locking up for a moment, I'll stand close to various men in these businesses and try to see how their age is and their emotional disposal.
Stuart (55), a family of Glasgowa, whose sister Ray (numeration: two young women, three men of middle age) to Reckless Records (numeration: eight men of the middle age, one woman around 20) has a meeting at London afternoon, and he looks at business to complete a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so," says he.
I've probably got 3 or 4 thousand cards.
All these loads leaving the walls of his residence - on the image above (the photo sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This large number of albs and singles also have thanks to that you can allow it: you can now buy gramophone disks that he couldn't allow when they went originally, and buys what he sold in a young man and had no wind.
“A lot of what I'm buying is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. There are things that would be delivered when I was 11 or 12. I was too small and I couldn't do it, ” says.
It agrees that those who buy ships are mostly introverted that they love their own companies, and adds: “I do not seek, and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of clients who are meetings is in the YouGov profile.
He also observed the new age of people affected medical freedom. People who heard about the comback and felt to buy their old graphphone disk back.
According to my discussions, the people of their congregations saved the most part between 1998 and 1999.
Providers who sold their graphphone disks and buyed a CD, now they sold their CDs to buy their graphphone disks back," says.
This could explain the bows of the loving gramphones of a certain age.
But what is an emotional importance of the graphphone scene?
You will not take you any more than a few seconds to find you in the area like Phonica that you will find a favorite community with similar thoughts in music business.
According to Weze, some of the elders are particularly deprived by the non-contact payment system.
Some gramofon disasters can feel plotted in digital world and decided for the knowledge of the graphphone decorations, things that call to reminders of peaceful dose.
“I think the fulfillment of spaces or property of something mental can bring a certain comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector, it's me, and I think it's a lot of people.
It's easy to fill the place in the head.
"We are all as their social workers!" says a co-operator from the gramofon dishes.
The investigation of the ICM company in April declared that at least 50% of people who buy wine albums before months have not heard it.
According to the investigation, it has 41 % of the demanded graphphones that never use, while 7% of those who buy graphphones has no graphphone.
In this point, the report was likely to be very worried when the complication boss was trained.
The aspect “troffee” and the survival of interest is something that Jonny considered (42) that works in Sounds of the Universe (the number of three middle age).
"Anyone came recently and said, "I don't have a graphphone yet, but I want to buy it on the road of Radiohead, so we can put it on the board," she says.
The percentage of such is not big, but it's going to be.
It's more about the product page than the music.
They come to us who say, "I have no gramofon."
They're younger people, not the elders, they grow up the puberts that get to it.
Fopp, where at the time, almost one of the entire boards are exhausted by a graphphone box, has a lot of different visitors at my coming.
There are a couple of seventy, tourists who do photos, puberts and women in the middle age.
While the atmosphere is not so free, as businesses before - of the players in place of the taste language calls the most recent pop from Wild Beasts full synthesators and sex, it is good to see the various recorders.
No one of them looks especially exciting, but you'll be hard when you're standing near someone 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks a few minutes in Fopp and looks at different graphphone disks in the left.
It's one of those who's almost looking for the expenditures than to lose horizonally.
He doesn't make a power, so it doesn't look at the view of the gramofon board.
It's a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on the computer or similar, but the graphphone boards have their cups... "It's easy to hear music on the computer or similar.
I can't explain it -- it's unique.
My last stage is a business that has inspired a new generation of favorite graphical decess: Urban Outfitters.
I think I'm very excited for girls in the nuts and seek a group of girls who are just assembled around the Poloroid photographs. Then father and daughter decided to buy Crosley's graphphone.
Left is a board that covers the wall of the graphical board Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: the current and classic music, based on any average collection of graphical boxes.
Nobody looks on them - maybe because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't get them.
It's clearly a "winyl trick."
But because any accuracy to him could mean more money for the exploitation and send a few leaders to Soh's deepness for another, it's not much to do.
There is no surprise that the demographic area where it is probably more time and money than in other areas, it is also where the most loss for the most luxury goods that are certain.
But while I realize that youGov's results are exactly - so at least in business with graphphone deals, they don't look at a large number of collectors and loving wines that exist in reality, in businesses with gramophone deals and online fores.
These people are probably hard to work in schools or officers.
Probably the fourteenth morning of the exploitation after trades with gramophone decks in Berwick Street, traveling and exhibiting the view of an apparent, thirty-year-year-year-old television moderator, which is hidden behind the back of nothing of the misunderstanding men of the Middle Eastern.

The Court in France refused to build trades in the U.S. D. J.
The Court in France rejected the command of officers in Calais to deal with ten provisional trades and restaurants in the Djungle camp, where thousands of officers live.
During the Court Development this week, the Offices in Calais said that the State should be able to abort the total 72 provisional trades where people in the camp sell goods from cigarette after energy drinks, providing hairs, the provisional restaurants sold the tea for 50 cents or the basic food for several euros.
The prefect officer in Calais argumented that the location is necessary to break, because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay the data, and because they mean the dangers of consumption and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations in the Court have stated that trade and restaurants are vital and that the food of serious foods offered to the State supported association and other groups are not provided for food additives for the increased number of branches in the board.
Short provisional trades and restaurants often provide helpers and eating serious foods to people in noise.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there is no legal basis that people would take 72 provisional trades to carry out, but he said that the prefects of Calais are "excellently understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, carriers and restaurants have a lot of greater role than the only delivery of food to people who are “wounding in extremely sustainable conditions”.
He said that the spacers provide a peaceful place to meet the bottles and the bodies.
One of the places that democratics had been a chair in the board, Jungle Book Kids, which carried out the non-zic organization, which offers 200 foods, English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of unlawful persons without carrying in the board.

He thought he was dead.
Learning is crushed by yourself and the volatile.
"On March I could normally treat," he reported to the start of the air preparation in full power.
What did you have?
I had an excited explosion, then because of the problems with the heart.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he made long years to Asia?
I had two years in the ship and I didn't know about it.
I was scared, no one found me anything.
Then the shot got up.
It's desolated in the lake, it's still pain, especially when it's got or changes the time.
But nothing that would be limited to me, you know, it's an ethical thing.
Have you been afraid of life?
He had it.
Last year in the air tourage in the fig tree, I didn't know that I had an embole, and I couldn't be smoking there anymore.
I've got blood on the night.
The doctors told me that it's something else, I was still five days completely sold.
I actually thought I was dead, my friend and my family.
I've seen somewhere.
How did you compare this?
I think I've had to live it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems that I have to watch more when I fly.
But it's gonna do everything.
As soon as I wanted to go back to the Money's preparation, there were still problems with the heart.
Now it's all right.
Since March, I was always prepared home to be able to play again.
I'll get it. I'm physically better than before.
What are you waiting for from the Court?
I'm happy, the part seems good, I know most of the boys.
I'm aware of the other two strangers who will come.
Maybe we're sitting people to pass with us.
You're going to take the Courts?
He had a report of a spectacular, but every session is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now the second ended.
There's a new team in the mouth. Only a few players left.
It was the last in the extraly, so it's a big space to improve.
As we use him, he's on us.
We'll see the first time, who's gonna be a shooting, maybe not.
Is Brom's locking success?
He's already experienced and he's raised a lot of things, he's gonna think about better than the last place.
But my commission with his unbelief, I've spoken before.
In the game, there were other trainers, with one of my big friends, and it was agreed that he was going to get here.
I'm not gonna say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I like it.
He's a great name, he's in good clubs, treasure a lot of ten years, he's a good player.
He's going to get us up.
What are you doing?
This team will fight that is my position.
I like fighting, love hecue, and I like to get an opportunity in the non-speaking team.
I've been two years in the Salmon, but it's a greater call than to be in the sixth team, because it's starting from the ground.
You mentioned a stranger, Australian Boehm is already tremendous.
How's it looking?
I know the circumstances that we played against us in a group at the universe.
And a couple of times we were talking together, sometimes we sat together at night after we'd beat, so we've already known friends.
We shoot them 3:1, I just shoot him on the start of the airport in the Coast.
He's a dictionary friend, he's a sympathetic.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazil Z.
Do you know something about them?
I wrote with the American, it looks like a good boy, Brazil who's going to learn English.
You contacted the American?
I looked like a good idea.
I'm a player, so he who creates, so I should communicate to everyone.
I immediately discovered what it's for player, I found on the Internet as he plays, I saw some videos.
He's all right, kid, he's high.
We write a couple of messages on Facebook, it's like an idiot, it's gonna go to us.
How are you happy to player unit position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm just gonna be 40 and I don't have the opportunity to keep it.
I'm nicely in the center of the division, and I'm pleased with the team I'm than to lead someone else.
I think I wouldn't want to play if I should be like a second player and take it up for a full time.
How many times have you been one?
The half-term in the Silver when it wasn't going to Kusto as Captain, he was hungry, then there were problems with money and he went away.
Since that time, we stayed up, and I was still playing.
In Brna, who I've been driving, I ordered one and two.
A great year was in the Old City, and I had a lot of offers, and I just chose the Silver.
They wanted me to Budayjovice from there, I stayed, but I wasn't finished because of that embolicy.
Now it's the new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half of the Phelps' domain remains.
"By again on the grade winnings and hear the hymn is sweet as always," Phelps smiled, and then he had the eyes full.
His dream and his mother were lying again, but Boomer's son, this time, was silently lying on the ear.

Bronz received China Wang Shun, the Bronz Medicine in this discipline from the lonely mystery of the world.

After the majority of the commitment with Phelps, there was another American Ryan Lochte and the house of Thiago Perreira.
While the purchase of the gold in the fifty-fifty-fifty cross, they were disappeared outside medical position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand its uniform medical collections.
A short time after the celebration statement of the half-term was set to the end of 100 meters of the motecle.
Legend couldn't smooth the country Ryan Murphy, who received the signary double - after hundreds of he won in Riu and a double train.
In the Final, he left 37 weeks of the Australian Flight Mitchella Larkina, the third ended Russ Jevgeeni Rylov.

From the mental throne, Larkin sent to him the same dual at the lone world championate.
On the olympian, but he got the medailles just now.

I made a big mistake one time.
But I played in the court, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm scared of that, she said the Russian ball.
The right starting right in Rio has been helped to be in the special panel of the CAS Sport Arbitrary immediately before the beginning of her.
They stayed with my call, and I won.
If it likes someone or not, or if he has another opinion to turn back to the arbitrary court, he's added.
Hermann: We could win.
And starting about the north?
I don't remember that.
The chickens are alive a special day.
They've learned about who they're going to fight.
They had to control the tactic preparation.
And then, in the non-traditional time, the shoes started on a small curve number 1.
The first hundreds started not well, then they found a smoking of the supply, but at the state of 19:19 they didn't control the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and compared, however, the decision of the tie-break didn't leave them.
The first number of showed services signed the progress 10:15 and wearing with the olympian tour.
"We could shoot Russians," she said Hermann.
How would you assess the shoes?
Hermann: After a bad start before I was disappeared, we came beautifully to the game.
At the end, I'm in the last balon, I'm going to get the reach that I've used before.
We lost the hundred keys.
In the next seat, we came on them with a view of sins, others, and we stood on the service.
There was a horrible training in the training, and we took this side.
It was a crazy because we could get Russ.
Slave: The challenge of the beginning of the first seat, it's gone out there.
We could get it up, but the bottoms were missing us.
The second hundred was super, and in the third, he decided the service.
We did a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and about those five it was, we've got a lot of pleasure there.
It's crazy because Russia's been playing.
How did you play at the small room number 1?
Slave: Like in China on the neighborhood.
The average and atmosphere were different.
She was one hour in the night, full silence, music didn't play, nothing.
It was a difference against the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was it prepared for the ball when you discovered the names of the comfort of a hour before the story?
Hermann: She was special.
We started growing up on the ground, unless we knew the players, so we couldn't make such preparation as the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch) took a taxi almost on all the options they were there.
He had prepared a lot of papers with a taxi, so after this page, we were perfectly prepared.
Do you remember that you'd ever start a half-night shirt?
Hermann: Maybe not.
We played half the eleven, but not in the twelve.
Russ' Birlov's blog at the front-off play-off at OH in Rio.
Market Sluk and Barbor Hermann's board volatile in the front-off of the OH in Riu.
Was it uncomfortable?
Slave: Because we played the last two chains in the group since ten, so we had the mode already held before.
This was about two hours more.
It's special, I'm not supposed to imagine that another sport has sports who have to provide their best exercise in twelve hours.
But I think we've prepared the best way we could.
We knew that it would be, but it's totally typical, and it's probably not gonna have a favorite time for playing.
How do you value olympian experience?
Hermann: Because it was a progress from the group of our goal, it's on one side, good.
We've got what we said.
But now I'm so sorry.
Slave: I'm going to sleep from this, and frommorrow I'll be on an olympian turn only positively reminded.
The big brother is here, the first SIM is coming.
You won't get her.
The new rules shall be related to all persons without Thailand, which are decided to order some of the local operators in Thailand.
Then not only on tourists, but also for people with long visions working or closed marriage in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National E-mail and Telecommunication Committee Takorn Tantasith informed that there are no exceptions.
The SIM sale plan was designed to be a national telecommunication regulator in the beginning of August.
New measures allowed to monitor their positions are decided to carry into six months.
According to Tantasitha, a means to preserve national security, which allows to resolve the criminal activity of the foreigners.
Such tourist SIMs also have a help to discharge people who exceed the permission of the residence.
The purchasers should also find the special SIM for the foreign.
The difference will be just the monitoring function that will be permanently enabled at the card of individuals without the Thai pass.
It's not possible to disable it.
"This function in the SIM for Thailand is not because you can always look easily," added Tantasith.
It is essential to add that in Thailand there are no anonymous exhibitions as in Germany.
The vendor requires evidence of identity.
On the other hand, one of the operators distributed several starting SIM tourists on aeroplane.
You were full of anonymous.
The implementation of the same measures as Thailand also considers ten telecommunicators of other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapur.
Even in them, in the present, the SIM registration is required, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
The mistakes, however, does not mean for the foreigner's obligation to introduce themselves when entering the local SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own SIM, in such cases, the Taiwan authorities will be short.
The operators of the country have given the same time after the border, therefore, after the SIM logging on their network, only know the relevant network information.
They therefore know the phone number, but not information about the owner.
However, the difference of the roaming prices to reverse local operators is so propaganda that most tourists in Thailand will start looking at local SIMs.
The vision of the officers to monitor the movement of strangers from strangers who lived in Thailand was legally expected a periodic crisis.
The Tantasith situation calms and, in relation to the protection of the private system, it is compared to the obligation of offering resistance addresses in immigration documents.
In addition, if the police needs to monitor specific individuals to need a court command.
For any disagreement of the system, the nearest disagreement will be threatened.
"If the service provider will follow the SIM position without a court command, it will be accused of a criminal action," adds Tantasith.
The system should also maximize and use preliminary carts.
While in the present case of a specific number will be recycling until the end of the 90-day period, after which the SIM was not reached to the network, it would be possible to reach the number after 15 days.
The Luxembourg in Vinohrade has a base and a trust in the teras.
Why did you choose to live in the new building?
We looked for an unfortunate residence where most of the pains of the ability of the manager's disaster.
The conditions were sufficient for parking places and expenditure in the house, which, basically, discovered an older stage.
There is no problem acquisition in older houses, problems with exploitation of grounds, high energy reliefs and similar.
The conditions were also large treasures, which the old scheme was not able to offer.

We should recommend cooperation with the architecture to each one, if it proposes to live from the beginning, it is also a very complex technical process.
The second equipment is a single design of interior: designers have essentially better representation of the shipping of possible materials and, based on customers, the interference is able to be able to slow.
With Lenka Langer's architect, we have already cooperated on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and in view of that everything was well working, it was a clear choice for us and when we rebuild our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and estetic requirements?
We've got a large-courageous society-above space with a responsible area for a four-quarterly family employed as modern, but no cold interieur.
The priority was to make a connection with the terases and to realize the intelligence of home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to carry out the quality of the exercise.
Have you left everything on the officers, or have you contained yourself in the final style of interior?
All proposals, including technical expressions and models of materials, we have approved, but the proposal has always been removed from the architects.
At the beginning, we decided what we expect from design, and showed some of the interior elements that we would like to draw up to the proposal, for example, copper or images.
I think just our collection of the Chess authors who had the work of Karla Malicha, Karla Aussuszyla, Vaclava Spala, or Otto Guttfreunda architecture helped to orientate in our income.
The combination of black, white and white tree was the idea of architecture as a single kitchen of the apartment, the walls, the board, the lightning, the copper, the textiles, the visions, etc. This is, whether all the boards of men were, then we were together checked through visualization.
Have you been discovered when you made some complications that you had to give original ideas, or have you been attached to the new?
Even in the draft fases of the project, when we came to the stage at the moment when the first was possible to go up to the highest of our border, and they found that the views we planned, in fact, the shadows of the circuit building.
Then we have changed the foundation by night.
It was used to be used on the kitchen line and to cover blood walls.
Then, in the interior, the tree grounds of the fulfilled ships, such as the exploitation of food and bar jewels Norma from Arpera.
How would you characterize interiors?
Do you want some changes here or is something you want to have a different thing today?
I'm sure it's about a modern air interference that especially fills his goal.
The changes we can't clear, most of the changes after weight have been declined in the smoke of thunders and inherited terases.
Maybe the only extent is to the ground when the oxygen tree shows us as too comfortable in the house with the dog.
Word architecture, Ing. architecture. Lenka Langer and MgA. Camila Hornym, manufacturers.
Byt is in the last page of the newspaper, therefore it was possible to implement completely new available solutions and some others.
The interior is an important element of the location of lightlights in the street of travel and main toaletes.
That's how we got the day light in the dark apartment.
The direct input from the main bucket to the base base from USSPA is one of the structures that was very appropriate for the function of the whole apartment.
The party is also basic and faithful.
In comparison with France, the Muslim lives in Prae.
You're going from France.
Where were you all lived before you moved to Praha?
My parents are the origin of Algerian.
I was born in the south of France, a cock from Spanish borders.
I've been driving enough.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied a journalist in France, thanks to what I got to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to go out of the land?
I started feeling that he was in France.
I just didn't want to live there.
First because of the atmosphere between people.
I came that every French is very negative.
People in France are generally negatively persecution, but the last time it has been worse.
It's interesting that you're reducing negativism.
Some people do so value the weight.
Trust me, you're not negative in comparison with France.
Some people couldn't come when they come to France because they don't know so much of the tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big theme is needed for money.
People feel that they have little money, but the minimum rate in France is 15 hundred euros, which is sufficient to me.
Now there's also a problem with human behavior of muslims.
That's absolutely incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my unuslimic neighborhood started looking at me through the skin only because I'm Muslim.
It's like I'd be a bad thing.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you just choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job in anywhere where I was, and I was on a free place with the Air France company here in Prace.
I admit that I didn't know from Prah's beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, the dad told me about what happened in the Slovakia, but I didn't even know what to expect from Praha.
Now I'm here three years and I'm not supposed to imagine I'm not staying here.
Is that a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
In particular, because of all other atmospheres.
Maybe it's because I'm not talking to Chess, so I can't take some negative reactions or reactions, but I feel that people are more free.
I can do anything, clothe anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, somebody still looks at you unbelievable, even if you have special clothes and similar.
I started looking very free in Praia.
The desires don't have such things according to me.
Where are you working now?
After working in Air France, I worked a minute for one travel web.
After that, we founded a friend a web site on which people offer and look for shared lives.
We're just in Pray, but we would like to expand it on the whole Central Europe.
Do you have some Chinese friends in Praia?
I've got two very close friends that are Chess half, and two other Chess friends.
I have to say that another Tschech's specificity is that the beginning is more declining.
Nobody's going to leave him soon to the body.
That's a very different difference in the place where I grow.
Everybody's on the south and loves the face.
It's different, but I understand that it's cultural matter, so I'm trying to adjust.
You missed you're not talking to the Chess.
Is there a problem for you in your language barryer?
I've got this too simple in Prae because everybody's talking English here.
Even in evening or in food.
I'd like to learn the Chess, but I don't have a lot of time.
And when everybody's leading a little communication in English, I don't need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there will be someone who helps me.
Have you met some negative reactions?
Do you think you're a Muslim?
In fact, no.
It may also be that I work in international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience looks like me.
My leader, Czechka, told me once to the French football team and said something in the meaning: It's not French but Africans.
That's all right.
But that somebody would have a problem with I'm a Muslim, I'm not going to happen yet.
And it's even because the colleague warned me once on a contrast muslim demonstration.
He said I'm not going to the center that they're going to get me there.
Protimuslim's demonstration is partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the present situation work on you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussel can be in Prace?
I feel safe in Praia.
But the problem is that it can be anywhere today.
I wasn't still able to imagine that something like this happens in France.
And it's not just muslims.
I'm not sure that the violence doesn't recognize.
People who kill are not muslims for me.
The Koran says that a man has no right to kill because he is not God.
What do you mean when the terrorists gain your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel stuff and guilty, even though I don't have to feel so much.
I'm trying to follow these reports about violence, but when I'm reading something, I'm gonna have to forgive something that's not my fault.
I'm totally another person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We've met in the room of Jiri's from the Popebrad.
In the middle of the Czech Muslims with Christians demonstrated violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that people feel needed to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they should do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't use?
Are you meeting in Prace and other muscles?
My cooperators are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious attachment than I, so we have sometimes a very wonderful discussion about the islam, because we're all considering him a little different.
I'm going from France, so I went through other education, they needed to learn the island at school.
We have different access, but we respect each other.
People in the island sometimes associate with the ground of a woman.
What do you mean?
I'm not in any case.
You're almost once.
I'm a woman, I'm a power.
It doesn't matter that you don't take a head cover.
For example, hidjab?
And it is signed on the main way I've been saved.
My mom is a really basic muslim.
It's praying five times day, but it's just not going to get it.
She always taught me that faith is clean.
She's driving on every way she interprets her.
When a man reads the Koran, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read in the Quran the past that God said to the prophet to keep his wives before the others, I said, "I am not a prophet woman, so why should I be hidden?"
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I have to access to Iran or Saudi Arabia where clothes are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Praia?
It's still.
I didn't feel so good in there.
I've been thinking about Poland, but I'm fine in Prae.
Even I have to imagine that I'd get my own children here.
Praha is a ideal city for me.
The Czech Muslims with Christians demonstrated against violence.
The Cozel's Fenclo Wind in Rio called a proceedings.
Fifteen carriers on the sea in the Brazilian Riu de Janeiro went out of the Chess Square Veronice Cozel Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she was sent before two final divisions at the tenth place.
That would be Chess to take part in the final ship.
You'll gather the balls as a pokemon.
They want to concurr to the translators.
For the idea of use of already planned paths for transporting the shipment, the television registrator Mathej Liška and the manager of Marek Greger.
Three applications with a variety of geographical experiences have been achieved with a thought.
National Application Transfer We started in May.
In this time there are thousands of cities in her, and we're going to expand the network.
In Germany, we want to learn this first before we measure more to the frontier, he says in the conversation for IDNES. and a 13-year manager.
How does the Transfer Application work, and who of it can have use?
Get her up and you'll be recorded.
Then you can enter the transport and data, how great a package you can transfer and how much you want to.
Somebody's gonna ask the transfer on that day.
When the traveling and time of advance, it is scanning, and both will come to the same notification.
It's opening a chat in that moment, where two are talking about the transmission.
How many people should be recorded by you to find each package always his curriculum?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't reject how many recorded and how much the path is needed to be hidden entirely optimal and each offer has been made with the question.
It's already working on the main taxis, and it's logically easier than the way between the villages.
More people, the greater potential of speed and exactity.
People also built confidence and make sure they're not with the package.
Didn't you have to resolve this case yet?
How many users have service after two months from the launch?
Now we have 5 to 6 thousand people who create the way.
We think it's successful, and we believe they're going to build others.
Isn't it hard that the sender's waiting for too long?
We hope we'll be competitive for the great conlomerates just because we can get things on the same day and for price.
You'll pay a couple of thousands in a large company for a charge to two hours.
Here you have to pay a hundred and less, because it's the way somebody's already undertaken.
Do the traditional transmissions to the future should be feared of the possibility of the customers?
We hope it's going to be.
Thrh has a large potential, a large overnational transporter here, such as the trade strings, where they all began to buy and continuously discover that quality does not respond to what they pay.
Nobody wants to find in the box of the box, noticed that he's able to take the ship, and it's the first day after 19 hours.
At that time, I needed a package for six hours and waited home because it was important.
We want better, faster and functional service that won't be happy to anyone and send the signal competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matthew Liška (39).
No one has never been involved in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of music clubs, Matthew Liška as a TV director.
In 2014, Shippannee LTD began to prepare the application of Shippancee LTD, which uses to transform packages already planned paths between world metropolis, especially the airport.
In 2015, there was a project for the processing of the company that created the application required for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programme was three-fourth year and the application was carried out on the market in March 2016.
The Transfer Application started to earn in the past year and delivered airports in May.
It's one of the local Shippannee-based version for the Czech market.
The Messiah and the Messiah Profi applied from the airplane and accessed users to the end of July 2016.
The purpose was to do all these applications on one day from the beginning.
In Germany, they want to contribute to the application and then cooperate with the strong investors to be more employed in the world market.
The shared economy is in the last time and this is the type AirBnB or Uber.
You don't have fears of the area that nobody can say where the border of share is and where the economy is?
It's the same, to carry another product.
We're clear that if it's successful and we're going up with this, we'll be another price in the eye through the economy.
However, although someone is surveying and makes somebody, it is not a purpose to achieve financial offices and money controls.
Each user, on one or another side, will be chosen to deal with his receivers if he does it.
Why do you judge that the service has so great potential?
The officer and the transporter makes it, respectively reduces the costs on the road.
It's the strong thought that involves both sides.
In society networks that people divide, we would like to be close to this.
They can get a good story, people have a pleasure of helping someone and to tell them about it.
Somebody needs to get you forgotten brakes, keys or pieces.
People, according to my longer time, missed personal access, about this application, we say that it's the service of people.
So how are you going to say that the cooking doesn't break up with the package?
Each user of the application together with the registration detects a citizen test and brings bank connections, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give the service and the faithfulness of humans.
Currents also collect stars based on the evaluation of the senders.
We're offering and confirming, we're still laughing.
For the unattached rate in the case of loss or disagreement, the core hands are in charge of the criminal law responsibility for the contents, if there is something contrary and does not know about it.
If the police stops him and finds a closed package in his coffee or ten kilos, he looks like a criminal responsibility to the sender.
Didn't the use of entire data from the database?
The records are in the case of the requirement of the supervisory administrative authority, which, as the only ability to look at it, we can't see them, data are protected against disagreements.
How much money will be getting after successful adding a smoke to the corner's hand?
The curriculum determines the price and gets the total part of what he says.
Refugees are counted in a number of percent in addition to the mediation of contacts.
These money are our shoes, but it's just a couple of percent because we want to click on the bottom.
Nobody can accuse that he has not added a steel when he actually carried it, the surrounding and reliance is confirmed by the QR codes.
Is there any limits?
Do you have any relationship with the size or the package content?
You can bring anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cocktail, middle as a egg, and big as a cup of drink.
Then there's no more limits, and if someone has place in the car, he's going to move the lead.
Plus a sender has the possibility to photograph the package application, so the curriculum sees whatever it wants.
Even if you don't want to hide the contents.
You forget the mickey, you're putting the curriculum into the hands and it's it.
Who came with the idea, and how long was the service?
Camarada had a idea for more than two years ago, then I did not have a lot of attention.
Then he showed me a demo application with an overnational increase, which goes mainly on the traveling airport.
At that time, I told him I wouldn't look for the investors, but I would like to stay with her and give it to the business.
The next year was developed as we founded in London's Shippannee LTD for the greater creditability of all products.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on now.
No, marketing we took place in the Czech where we are trying to achieve the application, because it had been a entire disease, and it is still something to resolve and improve.
We are trying to react on the review from the customers and the foreign market at the time we do not resolve so much.
We know that it's a long time ago, but we don't get it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippannee LTD was basic and most recent applications, two others were in their way of upgrade.
I'm going to move when we said that the national segment may be far more interesting and we're leaving it at least in the Germany.
The third messian application is local for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the second end of the world.
It works for the sender as the Transview, but it's the difference that you're in it as a curriculum, you see the shields in the form of points on the map that are close to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Applications for curriculums who want to live so we called Messiah Profi.
So, can somebody guess that he's going to get out of the town?
Exactly, the last application will stay in Prae needs taxer, student, mother on the parents' allowed, someone who wants to get the way to work.
Like now, all of them are crazy with them, they can fully collect the same.
Man sees where the cities are charges, he comes to it, click and see when it must be handled and transferred.
It's a lot more set than competitive services.
In this moment, we're doing more web interfaces that will be driving for the company to send a staff, on the web to make full information about them, or to create a map point.
Then we can use their services every month to make a factory.
Are you going to get the project to a full account now?
It's worthy of us, but we've got it normally at work so that we can use and develop projects.
We are two boys who had a genial idea, and the other attached to other introductions and ideas.
Now we are looking forward to the investors to be able to achieve us not the Czech market, but that should be allowed to miss the ball to go with us to the global product and to be another larger player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
Titanfall 2 has to bring a taxi forgotten pestry.
This makes the second part and only the game in it will be more pest than in Call of Duty.
The length will be moved around the eight hours and the fulfillment shall just go out of the shipment of the network in the first part.
It is therefore possible for the freedom of movement that includes the possibility of use of battle titan.
Furthermore, the game will also contain a level increasingly increasingly.
They'll remind the boards and rebuilding rebuses.
Therefore, it is essential for their convincement to buy double shoes, walking after the walls and the snake.
Sometimes the enemies will also need to liquidize.
The failure will not have any maps recalling the failure and specific concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to take and seek the clusters and shut the possible door.
That's how you're gonna be like a fighter.
The time of the game should be taking place between the weak actions and the more quiet moments for the research of the unknown planet.
We'll play for Jack Cooper's snow about pilot carrier.
Cooper on the beginning of the campaign, with Captain Lastimus, is a threat on the outside planet of Typhon, who is in the enemy soldiers.
And there will be no divorce to him.
Lastimusa also in the havarium causes death suffering, and Cooper is therefore able to make a task to take a capital titan.
His dream of pilot carrier is so full before he waited.
The first step, but the robbery battery will be required for robot replacement.
It will also be significant Coopera talks with the titan.
The player serves as a source of information about the military age, however, the robot exploited communications will reach humor moments.
For example, when the titan will be swallowed to exclaim all the threat that Cooper's worse at the planned expenditure.
First information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be able to judge for two months and Bonusweb will bring you first from the network games.
Titanfall 2 is 28 October, and it's for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ tag is living, but the original distribution remains dead.
Northic Switzerland changes the name to THQ Northic.
After the THQ exposure, the THQ has received a number of its tags and the right to use the logue and the name of the company in 2013.
Northic thanks for this, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Package Red Faction Collection.
In addition, it has not been deleted for the distribution of other 23 hers and 13 of them.
Thirty years ago, when I went to the east, my wife, after three hundred years of marriage, found about 20 years of younger man, our neighbor.
I knew that from the beginning, she was clearly trying for a longer time about him, and then they went together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because he walked like me.
She's totally crazy in him.
In those first days she even changed the voice, she had such a girl, loved news.
But when I told her I know what's going on, she hurts it.
I've watched it all.
Then he went from the work regularly in half of the fourth, so she always went out in three for buying.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
Afterward, I came to see that they're sitting in the front of him, in the railway.
How many times I knew they were right there.
I've kept the key, it's decided to get it there.
But I don't know why, finally, I've always been sitting home.
I never could go there, make this decision.
Maybe you're gonna be mad at me, but I believe that my wife has controlled me.
Soon after me she discovered that I'm a driver that I'm gonna do what she wants.
And I really did it.
Maybe I'm just such a bathroom.
Then the summers told me that he knows it too.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it's all about it, so it's gonna be bad.
Because it's all over the family, it's just a daughter.
So I've always put it down, continue and continue.
But one time I went after him to the apartment that I needed something to help.
He went there with me and I told him I got an anonymous that she's with my wife and she's witnessing everything.
I asked him what he's gonna tell me.
He stood there, smoked the branches, smoked to the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way from the business.
I told her that, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't answer it, and she didn't even tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything once.
I'm a man who never walked in a lot of way, who's got a problem to meet someone to find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I still agreed that it's over one day.
I said I'll forgive her all this, and life's going forward.
That wasn't it.
And I've never equivalented all of this in the base.
I've got it in myself.
Before I gave her it a lot of time, but finally I left it for peace.
He's still living in the neighborhood house and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's my business.
She's always doing everything, she's stripped, she's hungry.
She's working.
She always tried me to have no other reason to suffer.
And it's gonna say it's good.
But sometimes I'd like to watch her, get it, and she won't leave her.
So we walk together on traveling and buying, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage is.
But she told me she never loved me.
She had me, and she loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him today, it's her god.
And this life doesn't make me happy.
Now when it started, and I sent it very bad, I told her one time I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I'd finish it.
I wanted to know if she agreed to it or not.
And I wanted to hear this from her, yes or not.
But she thought, and finally said, "But there's enough place."
Premier Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French islamic position that should serve as a monster between the State and its Muslims.
After terrorism attacks, France is attached to radically islamists and to help the government and the local muslim minority.
"If the Muslims themselves don't help the State against those who break public freedom, it will still be difficult for France to reject the freedom of their recognition," said Press Manuel Valls.
This is appropriate to ensure that only the spiritual education in France should be given in the country.
It also wants to stop financing from the border, when the money often comes with the accommodation of the judge.
On October, Premier Valls wants to establish a new French islamic position that should serve as a monster between the State and his Muslims.
The new institution replaces the current French position for the islam based on the Premier Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It had already had to contribute to the extent of financial toxics between massage and countries that finance their structure.
But soon, it's been intrinsive, and it never worked so much.
"It's total success," stated Valls.
In the new position, it seems to be an ex-minister of the internal and protection of Jean-Pierre Chevenment, which is known as a resident of the sector.
In France, 2500 measuring and prayers are about 120 of them serves the radically islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities of the country have exposed 80 Islamian spirituals and at some other decades consider this step.
This week has also been a German police against the gigdistic spirit.
The immarians were detailed by fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them carried out a space where the faithful ones were radicalized and later turned to the sick temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Heddo in January 2015, in France, a new institution who replaces non-functional position.
All were attached to further terrorist attacks, which, in the name of the Islamic State, radically islamists.
The new location will have two main tasks − to ensure financing from home resources and to look at immature.
But it's not yet clear where it gets funds, although it is considered a few proposals.
One of them is a special payment on food salt, therefore, especially on the meat that comes from the ransom in accordance with the Islamic principles.
This price would pay the solds of the sales of food, and that's for the authorisation.
The part of the money would just put it into the budget.
Appendix 10 to 20 euros may also be paid by the French officers who go to Mexico.
Any year, their traditional refuge in Saudi Arabia will produce about 30 thousand from France.
Furthermore, the French ships should only be employed by employees who have passed through educational programmes on the Universities.
Their preaching should be in accordance with democracy.
The Government also closes radically.
"On December, we closed them twenty and they're going to follow," he brought the Minister in Bernard Cazenev.
"In France there is no place for those who hate and do not respect the principles of our country, as it is equal to women and men," he said.
Saragoza.
His old wife was hard to shoot the unknown shooter in the afternoon in the purchase center in the North Spanish Zaragoz, writes Independent Journal.
The shooting came after a woman with her daughter left the space guard in her car.
The man waited in the car before the purchase centre, from where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man turned the weapons against himself, written Independent.
The woman brought her to the hospital a unseen daughter, for men in critical situation, she had to get a sanitary.
At least 11.00 in the center part of the Arabon autonomic area, a local university.
With a call to the Spanish Agency Europe Press writes Independent that the motive was probably unresolved recent development of both partners.
We're cutting with Christen, we'll wake up rows, shapes and chills.
The late is easy, well-forwarded foods, but we are rebellious and we have our poverty and our head.
And then, from the aircraft, it's a grilled brain, a kitchen, a wheat colon.
Not much healthy, nothing too easy, even so sometimes with the exception of salt or green green.
Truth, grilling is worthy for time and goods, and it is a social interest, and nobody needs to be closed in the cook.
But there are also other alternatives, as to do well to the grounds that are especially struggling, their preparation represents small rituals, but there is no longer need to be exploited, cutting, cutting, and lifting up.
And they're still helping us to health.
It's already needed to be home sushi or sashimi, where quality surveys and some good raised griffs are designed to be ready and eat the same real exotic shop.
Like the more easier roles in the weight paper from today's receipt.
This is even a timely more cruel injury and smoking of the weights.
Paper can only be smoking in the water and then it's only important for the fantasie of the cooker, how it's going to play with full and completion.
It's not like a line.
The expenditure of a number of Asian cuisines is today and that the surveys are usually available.
Include the based smoking design, which is one of the basic packaging sushi or low agricultures.
You can also prepare him home, but the right red garrition has a single piece of the island, and also a nice poverty of the secret recipe, according to which it meets some kinds of oxygen and design.
It is therefore sufficient to buy a cup that corresponds to the size, and the annex with proofable antibacterial effects, supporting training and difference against the box or the shipping, is ready.
Banan letters.
They are particularly used in buddhistic and Indian cultural cultures to serve and achieve food in the most different areas of celebration and rituals.
The long-term balance lists of the bananist are very expanded in the number of countries of Asia or South America, as well as the "help" for the preparation of the most diverse feededing, broken and cutting foods, which are packed in them as well as in the alobal.
The banan letter then gives food specific property.
We have to buy in vessels with exotic fruit and green, even before he was born in the face of the cold.
However, choose only the green network lists, and then healthy - unprofit and without smoke.
Likewise, it is easy to prepare a sale from the row we wake, the seat and the seat oil.
He's going to buy it again.
Whoever often makes it up or prepares sush, maybe it'll be known in particular a number of nori.
In Japan, one of the most important species of the sea rows of which is produced by seeds, licensing and switched letters of nori – so the plants defined just to produce sushi.
We wakake - dark green row growing in waters around the island Hokkaido - it is also white and smooth and is like popular as the norri row.
Without those who don't recognize the field mission with the vacame, the Asian women use the payment to repeat after the plan.
And in fact, this series of effects are almost surprised.
Cleaning blood, strengthening blood movement, even efficiently carrying the seed hairs, and it is sufficiently infected mineral substances.
The smooth and divorced wakas also serves as a smoke, for example to strengthen the river.
Black rows first leave in the water, then they spread, put into the rent water and half-minute smokes.
Then it will be broken into the woodwater, the middle shirts will be broken, and they will continue, as a favorite salt.
Of course, to buy her ready, damn, it's the only one solution.
So it's only left to leave the role with a easy green, low and low, full of healthy poverty.
That's a long-term bomb.
If you go down and don't get a grilled kitchen.
Eat healthy, leading and flying.
Asystens know how to do it.
It's enough of a few special surounds and a bit of shockness, and you have interesting sights of food that combines poverty.
And it's ready two times.
Four cups of green paper, 40 g shirts, 40 g white line, 100 g green cross, 60 g salt eye, 60 g rows, and 60 g white chils.
Scarlet coriandru, lying lying of the black seas, lying lying lying lying lying lying lying lyrics, 20 g mag and 40 g based gary of the scarlet, a little pigs.
First, we're ready for the ships.
We're going to help the brown paper five seconds in the hot water.
Then we'll take her out and wait when he's smoking.
I mean, in the high water shortly, we consider Christendom shoes, the built after three minutes we're going to smooth in the wood water so that they don't lose the color.
We'll put a piece of green and we'll cut off.
Finally, we're prepared from the white wheel, smoke and salt eye that we're dragging on the dark neighborhood, we're cutting them with a smooth chellet, adding the white coriandr, we're just cutting up and put it on the rock paper.
On the banan letter we put Christian explosions, add cuts and fulfillment of food, we get a lot of wakage based by the design, the man's plot, we get a black seal, and add a couple of pieces of pieces.
The British needs to be satisfied with the money in the seventh rugs, Fidji's choice take gold
The private execution of the Great British in the seventh ragby ended with a bad piece on the last rebellion, Fidji ran into the final ship in the quarter of the evening of British at the Station of Goddoro here in Rio High 43:7.
Fijians brought mysterious lectures in the processing, shooting, shooting, subtraining games, running on the lane and brutal forces - and got gold, their first olympian medailled at all.
The railway came with an unexpected price of efforts in the form of silver medailes - for the third day in the United Kingdom - and the British could be on their executions in the inaugurated olympian tourage of the seventh rows of herds, struck the New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The expenditure of South Africa 7:5 in the seminar the same day, it may be dead in the final.
Of course, Fidji would have been a 15-year-old team in full health.
You can't write that for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have around the gold room tomorrow: the main fucking fidjans is Ben Ryan, the first boss of England from Wimbledon.
The Great British shot the way.
Eight years ago, under Ryana's leader, every challenge was played in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This threat is painful, but the progress is unpiratable.
Fiji started the grandfather, the britannicians rejected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchella and the other colleagues, it was like to run for a driving bus in the motion and the world's champions led to 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau was late.
Chasomirra showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down to the right road of the convergence.
12:0 and the Britannia's shoes are cut off.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the Great Leon Nakaraw and refuse him to shoot the third, but only Fidjian was disappointed.
The seventh minute Jasa Veremalua touchdown to the right round and the British played 17:0.
Nakara added after the return, and at the hours there was still more than 1 minutes... from the first half.
Then Vatemo Rava passed through a little British and accessed to the ground where he fell.
After conversion to state 29:0, the break was followed.
It was like Fidji was born for rags 7s, while the British had still learned the transmission.
It's just like that.
After half, the British have made a great change and the reform of the Fidjans stopped... for four minutes long, which in comparison with the first half was good until after the brilliant between Fidji Josua Tuis had not gone.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, touchdown to the left road increased in 36:7. But the ships had been winning the citizens of the silent islands and their fanoises were singing, having hairs and danced.
It was difficult to not observe the very amazing access of Fidjans.
At the end of the moment, Matt Viliame was still assaulted by another trial of the Fidjans' winning.
She called a letter, the Fidjians were scared and the British fell on the traveler.
Before the same day, Fidji in the seminar, was struck Japan 20:5, and the United Kingdom made the South African Republic in a semi-shirt semi-second - on the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown received South African in the first half of the lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hot work, broke the low line and cut down in the second half of the bottom.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony, from the fifteenth team of England, ensures winning - and finally silver medailles.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's victory in the Universal Flood inspired the treacher with the rabbit
You won't find more emotional gold on these games - and that's what you're saying.
From the first challenge to the last, during 220 criminal expenditures in the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their gold moment at Station de Lagoa.
Although at the joy of two, they were in the ship of three voices, when the ship was hungry inside the second olympian gold behind themselves in the cause of women's doubles, he was with them in the ship still in the current training of Robina Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport that had happened.
Their survey was absolutely absolute, and it was totally their 39. commitment in which they remained unconcealed.
What we see is two wonderful athletes, as after the water hungry flys with elegante labour - doesn't make the mind of the winning completely.
For each gold medal of shipment is a battleion of help hands that the cows sign the differences, and no hands were helped more than the treneer who didn't know whether this day is achieved when he was found a rakovine.
According to his words, it was incredible.
I've suffered a smoking melted smoke that can operate, and I've understood this operation.
Without operation, it could happen anything.
It would be a very bad situation.
If it changes your view of things.
Rakovina was detected by Williams in 2013.
Happy for the whole trio was that he could get a treatment at the beginning of 2014, beside the sezon, and reduce such cases to the minimum - if we can call it for such circumstances.
I needed to buy money, so I had to get me quickly together.
It was to take it.
I was in the hospital, and I went through the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said that there was a few steps.
That's how it started.
Sending the same way about yourself is the way, but this was something more amazing.
In directly after the winning, they were their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous tomorrow, talked less than usually as he tried to control his own disease.
Stanning, Captain of the King's mission in Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotions on day, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It shows it again how much it means for me how much we worked with Helen and Robin too.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so it's a lot of thanks to him, it's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have friended a better man for training, or a better cooking.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't spend the only conviction for five years.
The two girls had a great rithm which their rivals could not be equipped.
Even in the end of 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark had a very large reserve to Stanning with Glover.
We've been focused at the next time.
Helen cried, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important to leave off.
We had a good start, and we didn't even use to get something of famous.
We weren't happy for the fire machines today, we just wanted to send up, go out and gather the ship that happened to us.
You two will take a year to think before they decide what will happen.
Glover is going on the next week, she's a television goodshearted by Steva Backshall.
Now he wants to get out of this moment.
I didn't want to say that it would be my last order.
That would mean too big pressure.
In London, it was about six months before they discovered that I was an olympian champion.
All it was so new and I was too much in the stresse.
That's about four minutes here.
I have a lot better of that," she said.

The open industry loft in DTLA is expected to be amazing.
Bless us with the 90th birthday of the Central Library in LA. - What Next?
A prison?
You know, if you're going to carry people hard, the taxiimaphy Rubeš's taximphy, says to the surrounding disaster.
Six taxis and the former officer of the Office in Praia are as the CT has submitted.
You have turned a number of reporters in which you have rejected the duplicate practices and those who have to be in the group that will be before the judge.
You've made a lot of uncomfortable challenges with a disappointed actors.
How is the report for you on the request of members of the organizated group of transmission?
I was waiting for a court.
I'm mainly convinced to the judgment.
I don't think they should be in prison.
It's nothing to do.
They should first return all the ransom money.
And they should have returned them so they'll driving all the people hardly.
That's some of the solve solutions.
Does it mean that you don't consider the accidental crime as sufficiently efficient?
It's enough for me that some of them have such fear that they don't work here anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another spreads the pizz, and one completed it.
A condemnation can get theoretically two to eight years of prison.
Is that an adequate sadness?
I've actually got a problem with freedom.
I think it's a bad crime.
Close someone in prison, especially in such cases, it's unbelievable.
Such people should be returned to the company that they took her.
Through the fourth century, our land was struggled by the names of the people.
So now they're doing a good visit and developing people hardly.
I can't imagine it differently.
It would work as publicly useful work.
As somebody's going to collect disasters, they'd get a car and they'd driving people to Praza.
No, I really think they're finally getting a condition and it's gonna be one of them.
They'll find another way to get somewhere.
He studied the film academy of Miroslav Ondřeck in the Fisher and then on the University of Thomas Bati in Zine.
It's like people who started in the Czech Republic with virtual videos and videos directly for the web.
It works as a editor for the Internet Television Stream.cz where it shares on the orders, now prepares the Prague Guide order, which is particularly defined to the border dive.
These rubies are the form of short reporters of advice, which services are pleased to exit in Prae, and however he recommends to use without fear.
Before he called a series with names How is it, the city of ships?, living in luxury, and enough! and Praha you're doing works.
They are talking about them as a organizated group.
The police looked for her a few months.
Can such a fair taxi network mark as mafian?
They're like maffians, not as we know from Kmotra.
It's almost about mafias, juniors, but the organizations are sure.
It's only in that they look at the boards (taxical advice).
Praha is totally exposed.
I followed that, for example, the main training doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like taxis waiting at Karl Lasan (disco club)
Everybody just looks at its location and each group is organized.
It's obviously about the spreadsheet.
However, the committed are only seven people, six taxis, and one former officer who warned the manager before controls.
As you're telling yourself, no nobody's gone left out of the street.
How about the percentage of the railways in the tax service, then, is it going to go?
It's very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still.
I'm talking about Alesh Riyacha.
It's a person who is really dangerous - in his cars of telescope cars, and every fifth and Sabbath stands at Karlo's monster and the cars of people.
When I went the last time with him, he wanted to follow me seven hundreds for three miles.
His police wasn't holding for any reason.
They only chose a few people from all that big group.
However, the same situation is also in the other places of Prahy.
Thus, seven people are so hard to exceed a fulfillment of the steel, which, of course, has a larger size.
Of course it's not for nothing.
It's gonna help it, but all the wrongs will not be lost, it's true.
The taxers who run for the border tourists are still on the same places you have shown in the reporters, so in Carlova's monkey or in Paris?
Yeah, exactly.
In these locations, every day stands and every day disappears the excuses.
He ignores it as a city police, such a guarantee.
It's not a cocourkov anymore, but it's an easy illness.
Business of fresh taxis in numbers
However, some of them will only be taken before the court.
It's a half.
So I have to ask you: Do you feel a pleasure?
If I had to take it as an infection, it would be bad because my goal was, it's, and it's always going to improve the Centre of Praha.
And even if I feel that it's a bit better, I'm going to continue.
You need to press the door from the other side.
Even if the last crime remains there, we still have to do something to remove it.
It can't be happy.
But it's not like that, of course it's more.
Are you trying to confront them right in taxis?
Sometimes I'm doing test cars and I have to say that it's still bad.
Once last week, I got a taxi, outside the same group, and it was very surprised that he saw me again.
He loaded 560 corns for three kilometers, although then he said that he was 56 corners (used trick with a decimal line).
He had a board, a policeman came, and this taxi was so disappointed by the door that he was still walking after those police and asked them when someone finally gives him the 56 corners.
A similar case.
Taxictor on taxameter over the tenth row and robbed tourists with 357 corns.
Does it say that the dust taxis did not get up or after you showed the face of those who counted the insensitive parts for a short ship?
They're still incredible.
How did this happen to the taxer who's home 56 corners?
Policists sent him out with that they couldn't talk to him on the place because he had made a account.
And it will be, I think, the problem is also in the court (6 taxers and one ex-president).
On one side, there's some taxis with their accounts, on the other side of the police.
Only in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Master shall not use the secret loads of the taxi vehicle as a evidence in the court.
When I saw the parts of their ships, the taxis alone warned me on this precedence.
I'm a bill, but I always wanted to use it in the report.
Are you afraid that this reality could be protected even before the judge?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi could lead for six or ten corners to kilometer because he wouldn't live.
You talked about a trick with a decade, especially before the customers of the inner taxis.
Is it still current, or do they have a fear of this fish after the publication of your reporters?
I think we've made this trick to send up the order once.
Last time I went with one taxi, and I praised before me that he was the honorable taxi.
And then I realized that the taxameter's side of the black leaf.
When I asked him what it was there, he said, "You know what it is."
When the taxists did not work too much, can they carefully apply the judge with their colleagues?
Is there something that can repeat it from the ships?
You've been talking about the way they're always looking forward.
I think we can't give them anything.
But somebody can get them out of those places.
And that's the fair taxis, which should be busy more for them to get them really away from there.
Because of my experience, I have to say that the fever taxis in Prae are sure of lucky.
But do they want to go against those who proclaim the message of their servants?
They've got it, but they're missing their death.
They can't go in it, and they can't say exactly what they want.
When the demonstration was held (with the proposal for the entire restrictions from the office of Adriany Knacz), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
One of them said that they didn't protest against Uber that they just want to have the same conditions as he had this service, then they said that they want more than Uber.
It happened that they just locked Prah and just removed the best possible reputation for Uber.
How do you totally evaluate the access of the ship office in resolving the problem with the prevention of the shipment?
It's to see she had to go in to the crime police to resolve something.
The magic was short for it.
They had a cup that gave information, that means that the taxi division had been done for a few years.
I hope that the officer is in the last control of all lost controls to realize what he did.
That's the worst thing to me.
I've even been with him on one control ship that I've discovered until after their description.
From the publication of the last series of series has been a few months ago.
What's the reception?
I'm mainly thinking in the front-shirts before the series are actually the most interested.
Always when I have friends from the frontier, I'll leave them the video.
And when we're going to the Old-State Team, they're surprised that the same people that are looking at the shoes are really standing.
Unbelievable fresh celebrity.
But seriously.
I'd like to put a road around them to watch people on them.
Communist museum directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
You're taking a taxi when you need?
Sure.
I'm going to go with the services I don't have to pay for it, but the card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of suffering.
But it's too many disasters that are fair.
I just took a taxi on the street.
The leader said to me, "That's what you're doing."
I'm in the surprise of the Italian tourist.
It has already been written about the rate practices of taxis in 2005.
In the same year, Paul’s primator beam expressed the control vehicle in the surrounding of Italian tourism and immediately at the first trial of his leader exploited about two hundreds.
The editor of Rubeš had a worse experience.
The tax service leaders told him for a car from the Staromanist in Vaclov's 820 corns, which comes out of the crown of 195 corns for kilometers, as the reporters computed.
Instead, the Prague Manager established the maximum price for 28 corners for kilometers.
In the reports, there are also more surprising sums: for example, two kilometer paths from Paris to the Truhlarian Street are 400 corns.
Dear ships offered taxis waiting at Karlo's monster.
For an angel carrier, which has 2,5 kilometers, they have a number of six hundred corners.
Mramor's lowly cleaning water, which is most without chemicals and how long it is better.
The uncleanness of him will be well, even though sometimes it must be spring down the shoes, it must be broken from the wounds.
It's not easy, and it's not quick, she's close to her work of the restaurant Vanes Trost from Oldrich in Hajich.
The bottom bottom before it: the floor is obstacleed by the league where it is needed to get out and go again.
"Restaurant should be sustainable, patient and unnatural in the work environment," she concluded.
It's not far from her first restaurant work.
Thanks to her, for example, stone elements of fasad in the back training of the Friedland Council, she also restaured the sacred Mary Magdaleny in Zatai, the Holy John Nepomuck in Fridland, Pietu in the Friedland Occident street, the Mariana Sloup in Friedland or Atlant in the field of lazy in New City under Srkem.
With Melchiora, Kryštofa and Rederna was started in Frydlant in 2011.
Now the ground of stone elements will be cleansed from uncleanness and cross, free of stone parts will be secure against fall and smoke; or they will be cast into the wall or to each other.
It's also the surface and the concentration of the surface.
The letters on the sepulchre will be left again.
"Therefore the golden records will be started on the marmorous boxes of platical gold," introduced the reference of the State's memoratory of the city office in Fridland Vira Sobot.
In the past, there are no records about that the floor would have been driving some rights.
In the next view, you will take the opening in the moramor columns.
They're hundred years old, and it's about the rest after the explosion of the floor.
He was rich, weird after Sweden's journey for the Thirty-year Wars, everything lost.
The famous sepulchres were raised, she recognised Sobot.
In the Coast of Find the Holy Cross, there are restaurants with a peaceful accommodation as a house.
After the proposal in 2010, she was needed to give to the good of the flocks that were raised under the water, she was restored the baptist, a robbery in the grave, and now the grave.
"We'd like to go in the future," advised the Sobot.
Costel is different in a very good state, every year to maintain and replace money.
Restaurant work on the renewed renewed sepulchre will be totally 128 thousand corners.
They will be threatened from a question, the city will not income any of their money in this part.
A hundred thousand corns will just go out of the expenditure in the national coast of the Historical City in 2015, and the rest of 28 thousand corners are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culturality, the elder of Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
The procedure decided for the release of the expenditure for the restoration of the repository.
Experts on the future development on the selected foreign markets monitored by the index and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of a month and half year.
low volatility and growth controls on markets.
Who'd say that was the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which has passed 12% correction, is today to the new historical maxy, and since the beginning of the year, has been writed 7%.
Reaffirms the yellow rules that tradeholders should never go against the interest of the central banks, which, finally, have always been achieved.
In the situation when American actions are on historical massage again mixed volatility, which is currently less than 2014, when the markets are fully and without fear of the growth of the quantitative liberation of the American Central Banks, and as well as the VX index (VIX) has been permanently maintained under the border of 12%.
And that's not.
Although the Fed market continues to prepare progressive improvement of rate sazebs, quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full production and in the past week, the Bank of England, which buys in the past six months of billion.
The new balance of quantitative freedom is therefore pressing so lower expenditure still below and contributing to at least complete elimination of risks and fears from the future.
How long is this state?
Of course, it's a question for million.
However, at the moment there are no risks, the world economy will take nearly constant growth without greater expenditures, the situation on the Communication market and in China is stabilised, and the browsing is not already based on the subject, so that we should not be too much to differ if we have an American action in a similar quiet mode.
I'm sorry Juncker doesn't study Klause!
I'm very happy that my friend Michel Barnier accepted this important and generous task.
I wanted to do this difficult work of the experimental policy, and the Board of the European Commission Juncker, when the French policy (really experienced, because the only varied national political functions that the best example of European elections would be difficult to seek) was called the European Commission's main exemption of the conditions of the Condition of the United Kingdom from the EU.
Juncker's election has made a sign that it is a serious interest in the EU to look for the forms of future friendship coexistency.
However, most of the British media took the name Barner as the war act of Juncker.
Barnier is a royal European federalist.
Great Britain hates.
As a European Commissioner for the internal market (2009 - 2014), the European Bank law reformed.
He took her as he could only take her: an enemy enemy in England's free market and a model of capitalism.
Although multilateral regulations were a partner of the conception of the bank Union, and it was attached to all that comes from the London Financial Centre of City, he requested legislation to exceed the sustainable financial regulation sector and services.
So this is Michel Barnier, representative of Paris in the assembly with London, will be a serious, unexpected, obviously and uncompatible representative.
It's probably not a good news.
In this context, you don't remember the peaceful and friendly separation of the Czech Slovak Federation, which has so much contributed to development, overview and capacity of empathy of the Premier Vaclava Clause.
That is why the words can be the closest friends and friends today.
I'm sorry that Juncker was from Vaclava Klause, at least in this, he didn't teach.
It would be good for everyone!
Shooting around Putin?
Leader Kremlu left his neighbor Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday forbid Sergei Ivanova from the boss of the president office.
His place will take Anton Vajno.
She reported about this Russian media with a revocation to the Krimlu Printing Services.
But Putin stated that Ivan would allow his own request.
At the meeting that the Ross 24 TV station was transmitted, the President said that Ivan's advised to be the leader of the President's office for four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for the ecological and transport.
The report of exchange in the chair of the President of the Administrative, which is now leading to Vainna, is considered as an exciting surprise.
Ivanv, which is 63 years, is also marked as one of the neighbors of Putin's co-operators.
This former KGB member, for example, remained the Ministry of Defence and the Government's officers.
He will now leave the member of the Chairman's Security Council.
Ivanov, when he met Putin, said that he was a long meeting in the office of the governor of the State's own recordman.
He had four years and eight months in her.
In this context, he reminded that for 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been exhausted.
The chairman's debts or debts are not able to play finals.
No one of the fifth tenis treasures could be changed in a financial participation.
As his first battle, Peter Kvit, who was under the Portuguese surprise of Monice Puig at the centuries 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
They followed the Czech Devils of Shephery with Strick.
The transporters of sister Williams at the first seat ran after the outside, however, two hundreds, and the Russians finally used hundreds in the lost game.
The second hundreds were lost at 4:6.
Polar success in the last programme in Rio was notified by the Chess' holiday: Shivarer Ondrei Child, with examination, wind his seminar, when the second Damira Martin was struck out of Croatia, even through the election at least a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind was calm.
I've been trying to watch the best, he took the Son.
That's his support on the differences from him, they had to fight the procedure.
So it took them some powers, that might be easier tomorrow.
But I don't say it's easy, it's just playing me in the cart, he's proclaiming the guest of the Puzzle Dukly.
Myrka Topink-Kank wasn't in Snyk's shoes.
The fifty-year-year-old is in the seminar today in his quarter position and on the Sabbath waits to start in the B final and fight at 7 to 12 places.
The dear from London doesn't do that.
First, I didn't put the olympian into the final.
I'm sorry, but on the other hand, I was a quality deal and I gave all that happened.
The supply was just better, and it was a Topink Kappk before them.
She warned until the end, and she believed that she's going to get in her fourth games between the sixth elite.
The battle has been steadfast before the target.
I knew the girls were just aligned that there could be somebody out of that field.
The Chinese surprised me that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could go through Rakuschank into the final.
Today, she said mysterious world since 2011.
A lot from the final gates in Rio remained a young Phil Nepejchal, who couldn’t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be lying this time.
Nepechal was in 33th place in her.
The best quality went out to Russia.
From the first point, Sergei Kamenskij was 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Nepechal's shooter had 620,5 points.
In the first place, the Atlets also spoke to the programme in Rio, between them and the Czech Seven officers of Katerin Cach and Eliška Klučin.
The Cash is after the second discipline of the Olympian coast of the eleventh place, the Czech Recordman Eliška Klučin is twenty-five.
The British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, which rolled up to 198 centimeters like the second Belgian Nafissat Thiamova.
Both of them were the story's best higher execution in the frame of the seventh.
They were trying to shoot 201 centimeters, but they didn't.
German, Russ, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity such a positive questions: German company has passed a deep sequence where there is no Russian.
In both large European nations, the Dictators in the 20th century were produced, and they were able to ensure that they were neutral, brutal and horrible.
The Russian bolschevies from 1917 to 1989 contributed to 94 million of communism victims, which introduces the Black Book of Communism, to act on each day individual repression, goal honour, incompetent leadership of war or neutral experience.
The national neutrals have spread about 6 million Jews and the entire victims of the Second World War are declined to 60 million.
At the border or rejected territory, Germany and Soviet believed.
In Germany nor in SSSR, there were no only a few individuals, but the largest part of the nation had participated with these crimes to have already been actively, passively, or only smoking heads in a song.
This isn't the specific specification of these nations, we're the same guilty.
In Germany, directly the end of the war was the delegation, the Court of Norimber.
But it's the most important, but it's come later.
When the children were grown, they began to ask: Dad, baby, why did you participate in such faiths?
How you could!
This has brought real reflexes and the processing of society.
The German elite had recently focused on the prosperity of the land, the elimination of poverty, the beauty of their citizens.
Now there are others (timely idealistical) targets, but they will not be able to attach back to Alsasko-Lotrinca or somebody - to the revance - military - it is probably known everybody.
After the wedding war in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitively closed for a thousand years when the old KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin was obtained to power.
Many crime age has been glorified today in Russia.
The Russian Point Politics is a revance, a loss field, a Western reduction.
Health, prosperity and future of own people is not a value for the reality.
With their own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it's only those ten years of despower mode that Russians are not genetic or culturally minor - predicted to the Asian (see) Tyrannia.
Who wants to grow around Krym?
Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation on the Ukraine-Russ border in the Krim.
Who's the growth of infection?
After a longer relationship relationship was reached to the further distress of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian sides became the field of Krim, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and was part of his field.
The reports of both enemies are, of course, against themselves, and it's hard to verify independently, so we have only the opportunity to think about the old known question to whom it uses?
According to the reports from Moscow, the terroristic attacks on the Crim of the Ukrainian Party, which comprehensively rejects Ukraine and accuses Kreml from the vote.
For information on the arrest of Ukraine's special units on the Russland, Savčunk's famous response has already come from the case of the Savčunk pilot.
If we were going to the Ukrainian version, what would Russia help to disturb the situation around Krym?
The simple answer seems to be in nothing.
The scarlets around Krim can only be disappointed, especially from the West side in another form of sanction approvation and shipment of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the front of the immigration crisis came to Europe to take attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian rule has already lost a entire credit when the current support of President Porošenka is moved at about 15%.
The Ukraine Economic would have already been banched for a long-term financial injection from EU and mainly MMF.
In this situation, the Ukraine’s mode needs to renew the attention to his country so that he causes his further financial assistance and tried to improve the renome before the electoral in his country.
President Porošenko and other members of the powers of the companies are trying to show again as strong men who are afraid to set up the Great Russian.
There is no longer hope that all those who are trying to disappoint the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally know their great responsibility for life, not only for soldiers, but all the common people on both enemies and stop their enemy action during the time of their enemy.

The seventeenth-year-year-old Brittany wanted to get out of Rakky, she probably killed her Russian steel.
After the starting overcome and the fast snippet with a gigant who was killed, the exhibition came.
The expected Paradise of Califhate changed in hell to the earth, from which there was no destruction.
The girl was in connection with her sister Hali.
She called her again to British and told her she wants to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is as trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have a command to shoot without understanding, the The Telegraph's family lawyer of Tasnima Akuniee.
The last pieces led to Rakky, and the girl called the last.
Then she's already reported about her death, but she can't check.
The family communicated with her from the apartment in East London.
They joined how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped that they met the old student again.
But the Cadiza was probably killed before she could go up, because the house in which she was maintained was compared to the country in May, she brought the British ITV News.
The television added that the bomb was obviously disappeared by the Russian aircraft that was attached to the IS in Siria.
If you would take blue from the sky, just to get your child out of danger, said Tasni Akuniee, the family lawyer.
In the week, when (Cadiza) thought of a fugitive from the country of Islamic State, one of Rakuschanka was achieved at the trial of a fugitive of Rakuschank and, according to the available information, publicly visited to death.
I think this (Cadiza) has made it as warning and decided to nerve, less according to BBC Akuniee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana was with 15-year-old friends from Shamimo Begumo and Amira Abaso's school on the road 17th February.
They just said that they're out of the house.
But they've been married on Gatwick and from him through Turkey in the IS control field.
The family of the girls according to the lawyer did all that was in her powers to get Kadiz back.
If you would take blue from the sky, just to get your child from the dangerous area, and this family would do everything she could, she took all the powers to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without risking them themselves, he added a lawyer.
The only position is that the Court of Kadizi can serve as a fearful case for other girls or boys who are allowed to make the islamistic propagand.
"It's a lot of cases when people went out there, they realized how they had things there, they understood how far it was different from the promises of the Propaganda of the Islamic State, and they wanted to return," continued Akuniee.
It's not known by the Cadiz community.
Since they were deceived, their families have to suffer that they are with the most probable possibility of the dead.
In prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go for a murder and without a crime.
A lot of hundreds was the Inveraray National Center and the Argyll's seat.
Since half of the 18th century, the Court of Justice and Sutheren served as a local prison.
Conditions in which they lived were sick, and many prisoners were tried to escape.
Many of them and successfully.
Therefore, the citizens decided to move the prison spaces to a new place.
The new building was finished in 1848, and it was much more important to prison prisoners, there was exploitation and flaming lights.
So or that was not long, for the conclusion of its economy reasons, the end of August 1889, since smaller transport equipment was costed to carry out and was not too exhausted.
The story of the treasant and honey on the spirit.
For the public, the prison was opened over the whole century later, the visitors can compare the old building with the new, to convince themselves how different conditions were dominated in them.
The leaders in the customers are still achieved by authentic experience.
In view, there is also a mumble room where visitors can learn what forms of criminals have been applied to the criminal, to have already been the lambing of stones or to burn a mark on the body.
In the views of the tourists, the tourists can be closed in one of the objectives, most of the photographs on the memory, or to make their feelings that are under prisoners.
Mimoto is a prisoner of Inveraray one of the most known Scotland locations where he is very scared.
There have already been several groups of leaders of paranormal activities, and the museum allows people to get some spirits to laugh.
This night, however, gets out to 300 lions, which is in the repeat of 9500 corners.
Except this popular tourist attractions also loves great food, environmental panoramas and history.
“Anonym” effect on Snapchatu is criticised as a Assyrian caricature
According to Snapchatu, this filter is inspired anonymous, but some observers say that it is rarely unbelievable.
Application Snapchat allows almost 150 million users to change the reality and to play with the same way that is limited to absurdity.
You can make ananas, dogs, or position that would like to get out of the Roye Lichtenstein image.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved self-offs each day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
Snapchatu filters have served criticism to convince that the application propagate blackfacing or that supports the white shadow as a beautiful ideal.
So when the users offered a filter to the users this week, thanks to which they had smooth eyes, covered dawns and cutting faces, some critics have marked it as a rasistic carikature of Asians - "eellowface".
And they asked whether these repeated sports were not shown to the major problems of society - a differency problem.
In the middle of that Verge and Motherboard writes and newspapers and discovery were quickly expanded and Snapchat immediately showed that the function was interrupted.
The Community offered a statement: Filter was considered as a statement of accounts, not as a caricature of Asians.
But the observers who were rasism witnesses, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes in action.
Others disappeared with anonymous comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a student of the American science of Korea, whose tongue of photos was a wide party in the e-mail, showed that the filter was “the less fair and traveling."
He added: “It is difficult to argument against the comparison of the clear Asian characteristics and the effects of the filter.
It is shown that filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface), but that yellow face is added to the broken extrém.
Snapchat is not the only company that this cultural area has passed.
It seems that the American culture in himself has an infinite challenge of differences and inclusion, from the seats in the rooms in Holywood and the device that we all put into the hands.
And a large number of young people in Snapchatu -- who are more rare differences than their elder partners -- can mean that they can expect more civilization.
“When a Snapchatu filter creates a picture that is a striking image for some user," said the fifty-fifty-five-five-shue in the quarter of the conversation, “one of these things will be very difficult today without notice as it was before."
Katie Zhua, the product manager and the proposer that works for Medium, decided to remove his account on Snapchatu and called others to do the same.
In the Medium article and in the talk after the phone, it was convinced that racial motivated problems reflect the absence of differences in the employees in Snapchat.
Katie Zhua criticized the overwhelmed white, full man's leadership and the article ended the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It's so that they don't have a difference and a colored people in the moment when they decide about these things," said Zhua, who has a Chinese-American origin, “or the colourful people work there, but not on places to feel safe or pleased to speak."
Other observators shared her opinion - the weakness that Snapchat left in a significant way without responsibility.
The Community does not publish the numbers relating to the differences of its employees with the status of private community.
On the fourth of Snapchat refused to talk about the origin of his employees, but recently, according to the speaker's company, a Republic Worker, which should be able to take place for the unrestrictly attached population and to the internal management of the inclusion.
The Zhu adds: “I am sure if they really need other users that prove to say that it's not okay,” with that their account will be interrupted.
Army officers described reporting information on IS, says the Parliament Committee
The Parliament Committee in the report held on April, said that members of the Central Government of the United States have changed reports of reporting services to describe more optimistic images against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events of the country.
According to the proposed report of the Working Group established by the Republic Chairman of Armed Forces, the Committee for Report Services and the Advisory Committee for Protection, “great inquiry” was detected between the analysis of the Central Rights Services, in which their administration had changed their evaluation of the United States of the United States.
The Central Government, known as CentCom, is a military center in Tampa in Florida, which is regarding American military operations at the Central East and Central Asia.
In the print statement, the report states: “The outputs of the secret services approved by the officers of the Centrum of the Centrum are usually offered more positive images of anti-terralistic opportunities than the facts were confirmed in the land, and they were constantly positive than the analysis received from other parts of the Community.”
“What happened in Centcom, is inacceptable -- our fighters are cursed when the political creatives are submitted to false analysis," said Ken Calvert, the congressman and the Republic of California.
The shipping in the Centcom's guidance is achieved to the top of the organization.
The report of the decades are detailed on the surveys of the middle stage in the description and an analysis of the American ability in the training of write forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decision-making evidence that the above representatives of the Obamo's Administrators have established the report to be amended, the analyticals have received that they were from the parties of the Center leaders under the click to present more optimistic views on the dangers provided by the Islamic State or if IS.
“In the first half of 2015 there were numerous print reports of the central issue, statements and explanations from the Congress are essentially more positive than what events were in fact,” states the report.
For example, the representative of Centcom published publicly that the essential military attack for Moslu could begin in April or in May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains still under control of the Islamic State.
“ This is very clear after months of investigation, ” said Mike Pompeo, the Republic of the Party of Kansas.
Since half 2014 to half 2015, the employees of the Central Services of the United States were manipulated with the expenditure of shipping services to bacterize the risks of IS in Iraq.
The Republics established a working group after they learned about the fear of the analysis information on the information of reporting services related to the Islamic State.
After the report published in March, the further investigation should follow more detailed research.
In the reporting services of the Centcome, further investigation led by the general inspector of the Ministry's Defence.
The Democratic Member States of the Report Services have published their own recognition responsible for some of the work groups of the Republicans.
“In the middle of 2014 and 2015, Centcom has established a very strict process for the establishment of information on IS and write security folders”, reported in the statement of representative Adam B. Schiff, President of the Committee and the Democratic Democratic Manager.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “seemed to overcome the expenditure of officers,” he spoke the moral between analyticals and “respected the incompatible views”.
However, Schiff and Democratics say that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to press the Centcom's analysis to enable their conclusions in accordance with the "procedure or political situation".
The previous results of the Parliament's investigation were published in Daily Beast.
Loni in August of New York Times informed the investigation of the general inspector Pentagon, which was started after centcom's analysis.
Commander Patrick Evans, speaker of Pentagon, stated that the Ministry of the Defence of Parliament's report does not comment because the investigation of the general inspector continues.
However, he said that “the experts have sometimes not agreed to interpretation of complex data and that the reporting Community and the Ministry of Protection welcome a health dialogue on these basic issues of national security."
The investigation has impact on the framework of the issues whether the United States carried bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (the report that now announces the increased number of defence representatives).
Nevertheless, the lonely accusation has called the questionnaires on how far President Obama may convince that the middle challenges of the military operations in Iraq, Afganistan, Lybia and other crisis places.
The criteria of reporting on the Islamic State rejects conflicts more than ten years, when the analysis of the reporting services of Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote the investigation work in which the President George W. Bushe - in the area of many analytics - she had protected a small unit in Iraq and had only a little thought about what would follow in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in contrast to the Islamic Services.
The last year of the Offices announced that the Hooker team has succeeded to conclude that, in the area of the public state of defence, the air offices led against the rafinarian of the Islamic State were not explicitly financial resources of this terrorism group because the group has built a temporary rafiner and food sold on the black market.
The Times in September informed that the detection was not transferred outside the middle.
Commander Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, then was undertaken a critical year after many lawyers had seen the witness of the Senat for too positive war.
General Austin departed in April and in Centcoma replaced her gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States won in the land hokey in the fourth chair in order, so today will be playing a decision-making team in the Great Britain
Katie Bam in the front of Japan, who ended winning 6:1, shooted three branches and only one day after the American woman team of the earthquake shot the first two branches of the guard in which in the fourth America shot India 3:0.
Five gates in two boards are successful to remember, but Bam (27) said that she wasn't sure if she had something like this.
"I don't know," she said.
I don't think of those who record their branches.
But it knows: Americans on the Olympic Turkish lead to board 4:0 and shares on the first place in a group with the Great Britain, which remained in the fourth century after the Japonese 2:0.
The Great Brit and the United States are on the Sunday at the last side of the first round.
Both teams were qualified to fourth-final, and they decided who of the six teams end at the first and who on the second place.
The team of the first place will be able to make a lot of strong Danes who are on the second group.
As soon as soon as the weekend ends, the Americans here called their surprising ships, four years after what they ended between 12 teams of games in London.
It was Bam's in that team.
She grows in the Blue Bell, in Pensylvania, and a hooky on the earthquake took her first in her hand when her 3 years were (her older sister two girls played in Drexel) and came to the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player.
The olympian in 2008 uniformed her because she wasn't at the end.
Then it came to 2012 when it wasn't too much, nor the members of her team.
The next year was a trainer named English Craig Parnham, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have such work time in London as we have today.
We've made a full deal.
On the fourth night, Bam started in the first half of the shooting doors of the nearby.
Indie came without winning in the tourage, but the team showed it as a surprised and held the scooter 1:0 until the third quarter ended when Bam used the opportunity.
Unclassed on the left side of the playing field, then climbed into the middle and shocked the shooter into the gate to get the Americans into the direction 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last gate at half of the fourth quarter.
The explosion of the American branch, Jackie Briggs, who in each of three winnings helped one port was the first on the tour.
He's in a good form.
Like Bam.
"Now we're on a good place," said Parnham, but how good it is, it's gonna be the result of the Sabbath.
Trampolyline in the middle of olympical explosion
It's one where you are, it's one, how many hours it's -- it's an olympiad.
From the events in Riu de Janir, it is feeling disappointed, unexpectable and unexpectable control of life and efforts.
It's how the olympian origin is a smoking steafet cycle, which is transmitted from the shooting of the plots, the magnitude and the triatlonists.
You can't enable the TV, read news or listen to the conversation of your neighborhood in the front of the chair, and don't hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or unmortality between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the surrounding beloved woman with skins in the face, is on the first olympian and could also be among those who are named in households in the main sending time between the reklame and many sponsors, if it was a plot, magnitude or even breeding.
But Dooley (28) from the Forest Lake in California fights about the olympian gold in trampoly.
The olympian fire doesn't light on all the shoes the same.
In the middle of the middle, a little in the dark are sports that are not totally recognised: shooting from air guns, cluster, bacminton, tackvondo.
We'll always have success in the classic platform style - and it's probably gonna rule long.
But if I can name my marriage favorite, let me notice the accidental trampolyne.
Although the olympian sports are a trampolytical spot since 2000, when they were first mentioned at the games in Sydney, this sport remains at least 16 years of intervention - a lot of people I asked or didn't know that it's an olympian sport.
It can go to the regional loneliness.
The United States had never mealed in trampolyns, and there was no attorney until 2012.
The prices in the man category are usually shared between China and Russia and the women category between China and Canada.
Years will be gold medal from London to show Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The trampoline shops have more consciousness, partly because the ear of the unexpected ear will almost be seen that it's more hot to the class universe than on the olympian.
I have to confess that I'm not a department, but only a supervisor that looks out of the country.
It has comic potential - comics vibration of independent reversation - but also the lead of gas and packing, two sports that combinate in itself.
The word “trampolina” is declined from the Spanish “the trampolin” which means "Scocain disk".
Aspiring champions shoots a large trampolyne, which is shooting to almost 10 meters and prevents constructions with several elements (salt, rubbers and combination) before finally reaching them on feet.
The official olympian program shall be evaluated in accordance with the implementation, difficulty and ‘aeroplane’.
In Riu, there will be twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The normal olympian traitor traitor is forward.
Guerrers of gold medal must go further, faster and higher, sometimes until the end, there and back, up and down.
It is trying to achieve not only the target board or the starting wall, but as the TV reports, also other ideal lines: world or olympian records.
This unique trial is noble, amazing, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the wonders to the slides.
But it's just like me that's a smoking when you're looking at an olympian.
In this regard, the trampolynes are driving.
The trampolyne's driving is a way up.
I mean, it's not a move forward.
He or she turns away as if they were in the state as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without the top.
Unfortunately, there is no difficulty, but after the time of the construction, there will be no weak battle on the achievement of targets, no measurement of distance but only perfect, late time and gravitation.
It's just the nearest time the olympian and the zone are close.
The quality and final women are done on Friday afternoon, in 13 hours of east time, then the man's conscience is at the same time in the Sunday.
The NBC Station will finally send in the framework of the afternoon block that begins two days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the olympian dishonesty, they promise peaceful, happy moments that you probably look forward.
And if you have a attention to only so that the men's atlety will be the subject of loved views and disappointment - as, according to the Wall Street Journal recently proposed by the United States - then Logan Dooley only waits for their new fans that lay down after the deep.
“Protesting generation” in Ethiopia, a long-term connection of the United States
Protectors in Ethiopia
Demonstrators required political changes in Ethiopia have violated governments.
The witnesses say that in the chairs with the police were shooting many protestants.
Does it worse in Ethiopia?
It was one of the most stabilisable nations in Africa, a solid west aliance with rapid growth.
During the last months, the country has reached anti-governmental diseases that are still broken in more areas.
Only last weeks, thousands of people who require fundamental political changes were expressed in the street.
According to the organization of human rights, the reaction of governments was inadequate.
The witnesses say that the polices have struck and murdered the aggressions of unarmed demonstrators.
On the collecting video trackings of protests that probably go from the end of the last year or beginning of this year are captured by employees of security forces as young people who have been able to stay at the walls on the hands.
The High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights is now requesting a significant investigation.
Rashid Abdi, leader of Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group for research group, was always difficult to maintain this country together and to make a step before it would be more difficult.
Ethiopia is following Nigeria the second leaderest nation in Africa and its stability is supported by the West.
The American military and legal services cooperate with Ethiopia to eliminate terrorism danger in the area, especially in Somalia, and smaller from African countries, whereever there is something, gets such a help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown in a personal time.
Her infrastructure with basic ways has improved - in the main city Addis Abeba, even a new business floor.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
In particular, Ethiopia can be able to indicate as a model of democracy - organization fighting for human rights without approval talks about government repressions - the obsessions in the country were explored, and the disidents were effectively explored.
Many of them were discovered, prisoned, killed or cast out far away into the wilderness.
However, it can change.
“When people are ill and they have no other opportunity to protest, they will come to promembrance," said Seyoum Teshome, who leads to the University of Central Ethiopia.
He protests all the young ones.
Protests all generations.
The difficulties are much and are concerned with all of the sports on the ground after the absolute control of the power of the Governing Coals.
After the lonely choices which were criticized, the government side and its recent cross-christ has been held and now controls 100 per cent in Parliament.
At the same time, an increased pressure on the border with Eritrea. Conflict of this unexpected, a sport border requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separate groups, which were increasingly attached during the periods, such as the Oromian liberal front or the Ogaden National Liberal Front, may be tried to use and rearmament.
There are some factors who explain why now after years of explanation under the ground, these great feelings have been reversed again.
First of them is very inevitable: smart phones.
Many Ethiopans can communicate through social networks to several recent years when they were regularly available smarter phones and improved the provider of internet services.
And even if the Government allows access to Facebook or Twitter, as usually happens in the protests, many can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
Some young Ethiopans talked about how they were gathered to protests.
There is more solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural associations.
After a long age, the Amharians, exceedingly from the Christian highests of Ethiopia, went out in political and trade and used Oromy, of which many Muslims and lived in strangers.
But it also changes.
“We are on the path to the combined guidance, ” said Mulat Gemech, leader of Orom.
At the largest protests, Amhara and Oroma resident areas were achieved.
Many Amhares and Oroms believe that the Ethiopias are unrighteous of the Ethnic Ethnics of Tigrai, which create approximately 6 per cent of the population and control the army, the legal services, the trade and the policy.
Third reason for disease is Meles Zenawi's death.
Zena, the previous leader of the raisers, was the Ethiopy President of the Government of the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he was infected.
He was considered a tactic genius, a man who could see the roof.
Analysts say that, especially mysteriously, he has made the first signs of inhabitants and uses the elders to work and get the repository on his side.
“ The current mode raises the basic knowledge, ” said Abdi, an analysis of the conflict.
The new Chairman of the Ethiopia Government, Hailemarya Desalegn, was exempted from the relative unknown objective to replace Zenawi.
At the difference of Zenawi, which came from the Tigrin region of the north Ethiopia, has gone from the south of Hailemarya.
Analytics say that there is no confidence in the Security Services controlled by the Tigre.
Many are afraid that the results will be more bloody.
The last Ethiopia lived such a challenge in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what Analytics indicated as choices that the Government had broken and then robbed.
He followed a serious step, during which many protestants were killed - even as less than in the past months - and these disease periods have passed in relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated the Leaders of Ethiopia for the visa planning of infrastructure, which is a new business plan and a measured progress in combating poverty.
Of course, it is obvious that the progressive growth of sports within the Ethiopia government has not stopped.
And it's a dangerous ethnic forming.
The last month protesting in the Amhara City of Gondar, the business company of Tigrik was attached to Tigris and along with Tygreeans on social networks is still more common.
The analyticals say that the protests are able to achieve an unemployed situation and other western relationships.
The United States government uses Ethiopia as a base for the transition of drones over the Soviet Somalia, although recently stated that the foundation was closed.
While western wants to support the democracy, they do not want his connection in such an indefinite area.
"This," said Abdi, "it's a very worthy garden."
Donald Trump explains his explanation about Obam and financing IS as “arkasmus”
Donald J. Trump tried to vacation the most recent competition that offers his campaign, stated that it would not seriously think that this week had been a number of times that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “based” the terrorist groups of the Islamic State.
The explanation has called new questions on the capacity of the Republic candidate to the President to speak clearly with American publicity.
He also sets into an inadequate situation of his residents who cared on him in a loving time and has to explain that he might not think seriously.
After this proposal on meeting in the middle night, Trump confirmed the trial in the fourth, and in discussions he was not really intended to say that the President and H. Clinton's IS created.
In particular, in Twitter's report on Friday, Trump announced that he was only sarcastical.
The license was a review of an old one day when Trump in some conversations said that his accusation was serious.
When the concert vocational moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's notice to reveal that Obama has forced the destruction of IS, the candidate of the Republicans did not respond to the President.
The most recent story is coming at the time Trump tried to take care of his campaign on the economy while his preference in pre-selected researchs.
Trump and Clinton participated this week in Michigan's dual to economic questions.
At the fifth, Trump tried to return this subject again.
On Twitter he again warned that Clinton's proposals were connected to the increase of the data, and he showed that, according to someone, her words were weak.
Trump used the scarcame guard before.
At the end of July, when he struck the crisis when he went out with the proposal that Russians should go to Clinton's e-mails later to explain the words: "I'm sure I'm sarcastic."
This access to Trump allows you to press the borders of political statements and to maintain them according to the need.
“I think that it is his testing way, in which measure there are some reports of reaction to his advice to detect how they react, and according to the reaction, one or another means, ” said Ruth Sherman, the specialist of communication that observed the language that both candidates used.
I also think he's rejected in his statements, and he knows that they're sufficiently worthy to explain it differently.
Because the results of the pre-selected research in his efforts and continued to fulfill, Trump chose the last days more amusante tone, instead of guarding things for global volcators.
New research NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump was with a large distance from Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is trying to excuse me for the vocational expressions that says, but often his criteria causes false interpretations of his words or unbelieving his sense for humor.
However, as Trump in the end of the months of the President campaign has increased attention, the Trumpets have made the senses in the inadequate situation of his dedicated staff, which must be published in public, that its notes are already provoked.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the first primator of the city of New York, who is one of the most prominent Trump staffs, had to have a candidate in the fourth quarter in the CNN conversation content.
“I believe that what it says is the right political commentary,” said Giuliani, when the Trump's state was considered faithful that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama was almost unknown, a small organization who was entirely called a newspaper, and it happened because he got his army from Iraq.
Most of the regular republics are trying to argument that Obamova Government in which Clinton had served as a minister of foreign matters, allowed the IS to become and not have been able to control the situation at the Middle East.
Before the fifteen meetings in Pennsylvania Trump and still on Twitter, fired on the communicating means that they smoke each of his words and are struggling to him.
He spoke to the TV students who try to understand him, and said, "It's not possible!"
Some democratics are increasingly disappointed with that it is only another evidence that it is not possible for the President's office.
The cavarn has exposed from the price market, now he's returned to Greenpoint.
Camera Verb Cafe was a nice place in Williamsburg, where you could just pay, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee was given for 15 years.
Naturally, it happened that she was explored from the house to Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the business that Verb replaced in 2014 - sells mythes in the skin.
The locals struck it as the last loss of the growing city.
Molly Crabapple on Twitter wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel completed, and from Verb is a business now."
But if New York changes, it's also re-development.
The Remembered Verb Cafe was opened in November in Greenpoint, less than half north from the original place.
New Verb has a wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and dominates the similar, low atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verbu manager is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employer of the original officer, which is also owner and executive director of the new place.
Verb started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay a move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same additive and buyed the same machine model on expresso.
Even he used the light of the old Verb again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started to use new trials.
In the offers, there are sandwichs with shoe, birds, sheep and toppings, such as the camera and the shoe.
You'll also find the mixes with the wrath of the wrath.
The chairman doesn't have a drink, but he offers you a loud fruits.
After nine months, Rodriguez took a permanent rate of original challenges.
“ The rows of the original advocators were also needed to get out of Williamsburg because of the prices, ” said.
Last week, there was one of these conventions, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and in Verb Cafe often went.
She arrived even when the camera moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking a coffee for some time.
"I realized what I like is coffee and culture in Verbu," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, but on that day she's in place of her normal wood coffee gave a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term advisor, is leading to Verb since 2003.
He's going before work, and it's always the same.
"In four and eight here every day, like hours, I'm coming and I'm ready to prepare my hair with all and with the hair," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of new jury.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to share what is usually, but sometimes he's on his top with all the slanin, birds and shinks.
Rodriguez said he didn't apologize that he took his old place.
The reality is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him that Verb produces special meal and as a jurisdiction uses a filtered coffee from the coffee.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Poland citizens of Greenpoint also accepted the chair.
One of the new advisers translated to Poland, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would immediately show her to feel his new neighbors like a house.
The new place has more costs.
The local manufacturer of fruit sheet wants to stay in the lake and sell a filtered coffee.
It offers the opportunity to expand the cabin into the suburb building.
Many advocates are enough to get back to their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular lawyer, and when the chair closed, he was cut off his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the camera was opened again, entering and getting a coffee is like to come home.
"I've missed the boat," he said.
Depressive food from the crisis period - in "Square Meal"
As soon as the president arrived to the Office, on March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt seated in the Ovalent work and celebrated.
The Laboratory President Roosevelt bought himself on the selected foods of 5 avenue, as a pattern from the eggs and the Mariland field.
His menu on this day, but it was more threatened: the eggs of the devil's way in the paradise, the brambor pire, and as a desolation of a white pump.
“It was an act of cooker solidarity with people who suffered, ” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “This was the message to the Americans as they had to eat. ”
A couple who lives in Brooklyn Heights is achieved by gastronomic history.
The last book Andrew Coea "Cop Suey" was about the Chinese kitchen in America, while Jane in his book "97 Orchard" reports the life story of a resident house in Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which is in the Ukraine Public Harper, is an American kitchen history during a great economic crisis.
Sami showed a cooker solidarity and with the reporter met at Eisenberg trade with a small buffet buffet in Flatiron fourth, which is in the exercise of crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) bought a smetan shirt and a scarlet with oils, Andrew (57) made a step, a bramble box and a mixed green.
The Reporter had a mass carbanat that, according to a couple of goods, had to talk about food during the crisis.
“The carbanats were very favorable, ” said Mrs. Ziegelman.
He's sold bullshits, jazzs and fatal carbanats.
They were produced from their business and other living foods that the ingredient set.
Return the number of cups that you should have to eat to the dinner.
Andrew Coe loved him.
“You would be living in the prison as a lion,” he said.
In the years before the crisis, there was an American kitchen, especially in the foreign areas, given a form of food buffet, which you dream.
The teams were driving for the workers of the farm and to dinner, lunch and evening.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" follows the ways that the nation had been compared with that it was not the land of property.
“ It was the time when the food became a middle, feared point for the American people, ” said Coe to explain why he and his wife decided to write about it.
At the same time, the new budget diet was extended: the cookers could hide nonestical judicials under the ground of the crowns.
The black fruit was replaced by the leafest fruit.
The meat - after long years the middle American eating point - became a suddenly added luxury.
The similar nuts that were to serve as a caloric and consumption fulfillment had been prejudiced before poverty or even with a healthy understanding.
In the study of the book containing receipts, Mrs. Ziegelman prepared good food from the cup of the cybule filled with a rubber.
“ It wasn't a favorite axis on the evening table, ” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said, "It was surrealistic."
Burks are not together with a locked cibling.
It was typical for many home receipts.
As, as never before and never later, household economics - between them Louise Stanley, the federal officer of the home economy in 1923 to 1943 - led the pregnancy of land.
They published receipts and articles in news and magazines, invited women to overcome the budget's weight, and the lights, such as the smoking smokes, changed to poor food.
The book "A Square Meal" is a flat historical story.
The first law has become responsible for the governments of her hungry citizens, such as afterwards President Herbert Hoover, "I'm going to give a cocktail."
While he publicly praised a simple raw farmer cuisine of his childhood, he stood as a chosen millioner who became.
“ It was pleased to eat continent cookies, such as fish with the oak skin, ” said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in the nearly exposed room, he had a smoking on himself.
He was incrediblely steadfast.
President Roosevelt would probably allow the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor had not accepted to go in the example of his own prisoner.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt took an economy that was not interested in the worst, and it said that the White house had been “no longer given the most poor food in the whole Washington, but also the most unfortunately prepared."
The series of food reliefs from the crisis declined immediately when the land was set on the feet.
The reference remained in our unfortunate calorie and food values, says Mrs. Ziegelman, and in the way the knowledge is applied to the vaccination.
Parr says that during the books, it was better to understand the pregnancy of the mother's mother's mothers - why she couldn't eat.
“ She had a real fear of eating food, ” said Andrew Coe.
The Zeegelman reminded: "The people of her were wrong."
It's got a problem with the weddings.
When they were at Eisenberg clean tables, she and Mr. Coe went out the wilderness that prepared home: a low desert that President Roosevelt eat for lunch.
“ It's called a smooth crowd, ” said Zeegelman, and added that a normal trick was to give to the recipes of elegant names.
There was no crown there, just snow, a bit of smoke, sugar, water, and smoke.
Everyone struck the lying in the huge cold rods.
Surprise that was bad.
Andrew Coe added her, and then again.
And as the right economy said to his wife, “It would be a little cutting hair.”
Europe: Migrants are going for doses.
Most of the surfaces that are in Europe are coming from economic reasons.
Young Russians are playing with themselves.
That would seem serious if we had to touch them.
A group of Russian artists, named 2D Among Us, is playing from their born country.

Skat Callum Skinner's fast houses after the British got gold in cycle
Callum Skinner from Scozia came last night to the holiday street in a man's team sprint in Rio when three VB teams started in London 2012.
A thirty-year-old family from Glasgova was in the role of the ship that he took after his Skot Sir Chris Hoy, and a young man joyed when he came to the goal and struck winning from the hand of the favored New Zealand.
For four years ago, the British was surprised and Hoy received five of his six olympian gold medals.
And the same tricks repeated after the end of the sixth championship of the world in the tree cyclistics in March, even when Hoy finished his carrier.
The problem between Beijing and London was raised by the specialized leader of Jamie Staff.
The Indians, therefore, appeared just in time.
After Hoye was departed, he also tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British trainers and the potential search was now confirmed.
Kenny Hindes, who was with Hoy's champion for four years ago - and with Skinner got an olympian record in qualification, but triko took the first round in New Zealand.
And the British trio got in the gold sprint team.
Hindes was after his back low, but Kenny's team went forward and Skinner's leader.
The change of the strategie was a large part of the transformation when Hindes went to higher transfer to disappear and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep time.
He watched the BBC commenter's position and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes went out to the podium, he didn't leave their eyes.
A 30-year-old Skinner, a family of Glasgova, said, "It's a lot of comparison."
I'm here to get that best from myself and make honor to my name.
We created an olympian record in the final, and we shot the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumph near Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes recognised that he was approved after the late start falling on the road.
The note later returned, and the British supporters had no opportunity to call.
This time, around this victory, there was no such problem.
Hindes said: "I seemed like in London with all these British balls."
In the past three months, we were all as a team.
We have lost in many worldwhile, so to win the olympiad again is just wonderful.
It's one event, one gold medail for the nation who won seven of the ten-thee consents in Beijing and London.
If this should be a progress indicator for the past five months, then we're waiting for the field of five successful days.
With the form that Kenny introduced, it is not increasing that he would repeat Hoy's success and gathered on one olympian of three gold medal in the present.
This would be for Kenny - which is exactly a 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birth of 23 March (the date seems to be sacred for British sports, this day also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Morah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold and one silver medailles.
Like how much Hoy got.
As the other, Kenny will participate in the sprint that begins today and takes three more days.
Eight - year - old member of Bolton said: “I now use this.
The team's always the best.
You're playing together with the others.
To say the truth, play for yourself is a little funny.
The Indian said: "If he wins two more gold medal, he should have a rhythm title."
It was the only medical lead that day, but the British expected further good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were qualified as the fastest in the shopping of the group for four kilometres.
They ended at 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
First round and final (22:42) are confronted in the second day of the convention, on which Wiggins is achieved.
Yesterday, before the qualification commitment, he discussed with the Commissioner when the decisions had decided to measure higher.
In the general case of a woman who continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trottova, Joanna Rowsell Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie with time 4:13.260.
The VB team joined his strong tree cycle team and controlled the average time of olympian hero and received a lot of medals.
After real exclusive conclusions showing direct overseer in Beijing and London, it was reduced during the preparation for Rio expectation.
The dramatic events were on the background, in the last section of the technical director Shane Sutton in April because of sexualism and discrimination, and the end of the large carriers, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as it adds the first night of conventions on the planet, it seems that the legal reputable is that the Great Britain team can provide a spectacular execution with perfect time to confirm it again.
The most important future of the tariff in Portland after the end of the Treaty on Energy Add
The construction of the Portuguese Taiwan in Victoria - and the workplaces of hundreds of workers - is not aware of the electricity, which has reported on the meaning of one of the owners of the officers of the additives of electricity, and expects that all the additive contracts of the electricity will be disappeared.
In this case, the Government of Victoria has decided that it does not provide any payment that the business is maintained in the course.
The payment of twenty-year-old demand is exceeding in November.
In the Alcoa Portland company, it may be in a worm to 2000 workplaces.
When closed, it may be avoided until 2000 workplaces - right or unnecessary.
And as a tavern consumption around 10% of total electricity produced in Victoria, it can get to further lavinable impacts.
Alcoa closed the Taiwan Point Henry in 2014, which was led to close Anglese's electricity.
The Alco's board company in Portland is a pregnant and horrible closing.
This step follows several years of speculation on the future of the business, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the concurrence.
AGL, which adds an electricity from Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley field, has reported that some of the other three owners are also decided to fulfil the contract.
The majority of the officers are the common company of Alcoa and Alumina, small business parties hold the CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Portuguese commitment will continue to function, and other words, so that the excessive question will continue electrically from the board,” said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were thus called "assurance contracts" which should be entered into force since November 2016.
The Treaty has 12 months of explanation, so their efficiency will actually end in 2017.
“AGL further suggests that the contracts will be shared on the risk for the fishing year 2017," said the electricity.
Any possible impact on the AGL tissue from the fishing year 2018 is further limited by the strong view of the Commission market for the major market prices of electricity.
The AGL stated that there was already the value of the agreement according to its account books for up to 187 million dollars "for the case that it would be done."
The Alcoa Community declared that the agreement decided to conclude “no impact on her ... capacity to carry up the tariff or to ensure the additives of the electricity to the tariff.”
The American company declared that in 2010, Loy Yang contract was closed for 20 years, which had to start paying from November this year, even though he had to explain why he had been fulfilled from the Treaty.
Analytics are very careful if it is possible to close Portland boards in Victoria and Tomago's ship in near Newcastle in the consequences of difficult economy in the floor.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned into an analysis at the beginning of this week, said that Portland uses an annual use of 600 electric energy and Tomago about 900 megawats.
If both of these companies were downloaded from the market, it would be significant to reduce the significant reduction of the demands on the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only a real TV show of Kardashian - now is a close Vogue shooter
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of mothermanjords of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, she appeared on the title page of a closed publication of the American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, an ambassador of Estee Lauder, who predicted a week fashion in Milan, Paris and New York, announced a newspaper on his account on Instagram.
“ In the rooms of full people I love, I want to plot on this title page," wrote Kennall.
The title pages followed a bizarre (or simply to continue humoresc in Cardashian's training?) inscending videos in which the whole family of Cardashian-Jenners was (bars of exchangers of Rob and Caitly and with them all the favorite boys of juvenile, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On their sister's front, they only forgot that the scene could be completed by a classic defense: they prepare a party.
It's a limited story line at least every "born" of the child's TV show (Seacrest says: "You thought we've forgotten you?" with the rightness of the rocked Queen in order for eight hours of morning), but Christ had some need to ensure that the other girls could live in this public.
Because when we look at the close number of Vogue magazine, we certainly entered into the New Cardashian Eries.
The old sister Kim, possibly Kendall at Vogue's board (with with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the locked magazine is another link.
The Vogue magazine is the most sold number of the year.
The exhibition of his deeply recognised book for public purposes than the modem magazine applies to a total number of incertains (Fashionist mentioned that from 832 pages in the lonely publishment was 615 pages with a reklame content).
The absence of the stars appeared on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is not amazing that the pictures of the magazine were not yet unable before its official publication in the past two years.
In the middle of the women that have discovered in the front, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the title page has appeared more “celebrit that makes models” than“models that are celebrits”.
Jennifer Lawrence, customer of Oscar, and Dior's ambassador, appeared on the title in 2013, for a year later, the honor of Lagy Gaga was respected.
But even though it is very unprobable that Kendall, whose magazine, describes as a "the average model" of her generation, will fall into the first category, will be in a very good company.
These celebrites are not relatively known people, nor stars of real show, or children today who know how to make a well-screen video (and when Jenner presents all this).
They're properly talented women who are out of a funeral industrie.
Beyonce, who appeared on the title page, was one of the most strongest years in her carriage by education of the Alba Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone's success of Jenner's.
Her position in the world will always be difficult because of her participation in the show reality.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Haydo and called them "the girls of time".
These feelings were again discovered by the report that Jenner is revealed on Vogue's front.
But this unfortunateness is not on the place.
Kendall Jenner's on the guard Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right word.
It's for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sold pictures themselves on their own payers.
He sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughters who came to the LOVE magazine.
And in free moments, it affects show reality, maybe only as one of the ways to see Kurtney and her children.
The Community Centre of the legal assistance annual rejects 160 000 people
More than 160,000 of the worried citizens are rejected in the Community centres and in the sector itself will be rejected by further restrictions of financial measures on the overall service.
In Queensland, three of five people - overwhelming people in advanced age, immigrants, worrying workers, violence victims and people without financial instruments to fight wrongly and similarly - they are rejected already at the moment when they look for free legal assistance and accession.
Communities of law that have already been writed to be able to be able to fulfill other clusters.
Since June of the next year, this legal assistance centre will be achieved for more than 30 per cent of federal finances.
The Governor of the Communities Center's legal assistance in Queenslad James Farrell said that, according to the most common report of the National Association of the Communities Centre of Aid, it was confirmed that it was rejected every year five thousand people.
Mr. Farrell said that if the federal government decided, the situation would be disappointed.
“Communist legislation center in Queensland are chronicly undertaken, which means that thousands of people are denied lively important services that they need,” said.
People who joined the relationship with the violence, people with the overridged and reliable debts, families who walk in disagreement, workers who are wrongly prohibited - all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they don't have the opportunity to get aid they need.
The Federal Government from June 2017 reduces the financing of 30 per cent, which brings to that other thousands of people in Queensland should be urgent in comprehensive legal problems without help.
We call the State Leader and Senator Queensland George Brandis to immediately refuse this refund of funds to make people aid that they need when they get to legal problems.
The Government of the State continued to ensure the financing of the legal assistance to the entire international average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of the Community centres of legal assistance and society of their clients and the Palestinian government must invest to this important work.

British needs to expand the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be the source of renew and prosperity, not only for our local communities, such as London, but in the whole country.
For me, Heathrow is a great way to be attached, just as London 2012, when we have made a lot of efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to take care of the olympian herds.
Olympic games signed several contributions for Startford and East End.
And we will do it again so we create opportunities for local people and companys near Heathrow.
Only for our local community, we create 10 000 new school places, 40 000 new jobs and we end with the unemployment of young people around the air.
Like the London Olympia in 2012, there will also find tattoos who will think that Heathrow's extension is too big.
It was told me that the British will never be prepared for the olympian games and we'll be amazing at the world's late.
The hypocrites were wrong in 2012 and Heathrow also shows that they had no truth.
Heathrow will always be needed to fulfill overseers, but Heathrow will answer every question that is concerned with him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure in which many people and fire shares, not only a few.
The extension is the opportunity to create 180 000 new workplaces, the economic growth of 211 billion library, to refuse heritage in the form of employment and employment as well as in the aircraft, as well as in the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has carried in the term and with the established budget programme in the infrastructure for 11 billion library, starting by the T5 terminal, which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years after himself, after the T2 terminal, which was established between two the most vulnerable borders of the world.
Now they are ready to add third rank, for which 16 billion library of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a great success in the Great Britain and I realized that Heathrow's extension will also be.
It's time to continue to expand the spirit of the olympical herds and expand Heathrow, ensure business to the future, and to leave heritage and employment in which Britain can be hungry.
Mr Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the representative and the previous committee for the business of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game on a kitchen and Mouse in blocking the reklame
From the tests, how to obtain programmes of locking reklame, it became a game on the online marketing and the mouse. It says at least one of the companies that programme such software.
On the fourth, then only two days after Facebook announced that it would block reporting filters on their desktop pages, the Adblock Plus company published an article on their pages, in which users can update filters in their program and lock the reklame on this social network.
Facebook showed that his desktop web pages would change the encoding around the reklame to make it more important for the reklame filters to find which parts of the pages are recognized.
But Adblock now says that new codes have already found.
The Adblock Ben Williams reported in the blog that “the war between the community open source blocking and those who are trying to be obeyed, remains since the locking of the reklame was found, ” and that Facebook probably comes with another own challenge.
The fact that the most largest social network of the owners of the world has been established in the war, just proves how a big problem has been blocking the industrie.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe carried on the whole world filters about 200 million people - at least fourth grade before it was in 2013.
The mobile record is now 84 per cent of ships from the Facebook reklame, each day Facebook from the mobile device visits 1,03 billion active users.
The speaker stated that society is, of course, against the public filters on the desktop, because mobile filters are not functioning on mobile applications for social networks and Instagram.
Desktop reklames are still present as high as far as Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also showed that it would be updated tools for the "reklame settings" (in preferences) to give people better control how they show them.
In Facebook, he announced that new Adblock filters are worried because they could also block the contents that are not agreed.
"For people, this is not a pleasant experience and we want to resolve this problem," said the Facebook speaker in the email statement.
The locking of the reklame is an invalid tool, and so we enjoyed the building of tools, such as Ad Preferences, who give the control of people.

The CNN shall ensure that people in the air is the most loss for the balance of water.
The chairman sold Hudson's travel essencial stores published data for the last year, where 10 products in its aircrafts are buying most part.
The water was first.
They were usually very favorable, in the first decade they were eight.
The nineteenth place contained a large M&M bombons with a total protection.
And you can decide who's going to find the first ten?
As the only one of the above, it cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it's the Wall Street Journal.

The universe sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond smiled.
Assembly Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand are sovereign to rule two categorys without a cormilter for seven years and their dominants confirmed the olympian games in Riu de Janeiro.
In the first view of the non-governmental duties, the third competition has passed to a smaller seat after the olympiad in Beijing and since 2009.
On the lake Rodriga de Freitase, in the fourth final, the 69th expenditure was recorded.
What are we different than others?
We're just nice, Murray's smoking already during the olympical records when he had to answer the questions of the domination of the New Zealand twice.
We're not doing anything different to others.
We're just stealing, a lot of hard.
And we're still trying to improve our technology, that's our philosophy, Murray said seriously.
Their overseer is aware of it and because they are physically different.
Murray is at least two metres and stolic chass, academicly looking at Bond is about five centimeters less and about 15 kilograms is easy.
In addition, they have different attention.
Bond is studying and funding, Murray has a charitical boxer shop.
And because of this, without the celebration of the time, it will not be able to reach.
Eric goes to the ship based on we can't play.
We're just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be shown, admitted by Bond, who also predicted on the print conference that the dominant in the staff was Murray.
He just always replied as the first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
But on the water there is no suffering with peaceful strength.
They're going their time, and sometimes they need not to be in the half of them, and they have not found the receipt on their progressive acceleration.
We're driving on two miles, and we never wanted to go to the first miles of the air.
We're just trying to leave time that nobody else can do.
We know what we need to do to play, he said the 40-year-old Murray.
With his four years of younger partners, he received seven gold medailles for the mystery of the world.
Triumph was also in 2007 when both gold four members were without a cormidel.
Just after unexpected success, greater olympiad in Beijing for a year later decided to move to two without a cormidel.
On the olympians in London, of course, the greatest challenge of their carriers was declined and the dominants confirmed in Riu.
London was very intensive.
We did everything that the trainer told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a bit more funny.
We knew that it would be hard, and we had to make sure we were psychically well, he took Murray.
We know that everyone wants us to get out of the throne.
We're still on the back.
But we're trying to be half a step before all, he adds.
Climate model according to NASA: Venus was once resident
According to the projecting of the new climate model of the NASA, Venus was once resident.
Scientific scientists in Goddard of the NASA for the universe study have developed a model for the study of Venus through tools and algorithms such as scientists who use climate study.
The Model was proposed to determine whether on Venus, whose ground is horror, without water and CO2, could dominate the conditions of similar conditions on Earth.
The scientists have already proposed that the low speed of Venush can explain her humble atmosphere.
According to the most recent simulations, Venezuela seems that Venezuela had ever been able to honor a direct atmosphere like Earth, and then he asked to be soon.
The Model also had the previous topography of Venus.
At the planet, it was likely to be far more than on Earth, but once there was enough water and agricultural diversity to dominate life on it and to provide protection against quick disappointment.
The winds also used the sun, which was about 30% more dark.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venuses model, during a few intervals, it makes its day part to the sun almost two months at the same time, ” explains a scientist from GSS Anthony Del Genio in the new report.
This includes the creation of the rain and the rain, which creates a huge level of clouds that keep as the rainer and the grounds of the rain.
The result is subject to average temperatures that actually are less than in the present time on Earth.
The Model set the story of Venuses' similar evolution that has been the planetary scientists before.
Although Venus was probably resident in the past -- in a few billions of years -- it was established to a huge horse and ultrafial rate.
Her oceans were scattered and the water parks were burned with ultrafial light.
The car united and remained only a hushing atmosphere of oxyde carbon with a dead effect of the skin floor -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchs have received their results from the new climate model Venuses in the magazine of Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy was replaced on the training team of Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy, on the fourth of his trainer post and Vice-President of the Hoke Operations Team Colorado Avalanche, made a reason for the possibility of participating in the decision-making process in the issues of the team.
The Executive Vice-President/General Manager Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed a step and showed that the club will begin to search for a new trainer immediately.
“In the past three years I worked as the main trainer and Vice-President of Hoke Operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, yours and your decisions,” reported the 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
For long and intense years, I thought how I could improve the team, give him the depth that he needs, and get it up to the higher level.
In order to get it possible, it is necessary that the vision of the trainer and the Vice-President of the Hoke Operations are in accordance with the vision of the organization.
It must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions that have an impact on the implementation of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled in the present time.
Sakic, which Roye accepted on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team.
"Patrick informed me about his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we bring him to the future a lot of happiness.
Roy was named for Jack Adams as the best trainer of ligy during his first section with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He brought the team to 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. But Colorado was involved with Minnesota in the first role of play-off, and during the last two years, he had not always been raised.
The Avalanche team in the section 2015/2016 got 39:39:4, and he had five points to get the second divine cards in the West Conference.
The branch of Roy, who wrote to the Honor Seas, won Stanley Cuup four times -- two times with Montreal Canadians and two times with Avalanche.
Workers in the northern Sea renew conversations and interrupt the stage
Representatives of the Treaty Parties have noticed that the stages for the employees in the North Sea are interrupted, while all the parties of the sports were meeting on the new row of destruction.
To stay against the company of Wood Group's fields, I'm sportly located on the boards in the North Sea, which runs Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Affairs Organization of the Union and the RMT may confirm that the process has agreed to re-reform the current disagreements,” shall be concluded in the statement.
In the next week, we will have a number of weeks of global meetings in which we are trying to see problems from the new angles.
According to the organisations, their recent actions were first than 25 years, against the protest against the smoke to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group company reduced the taxes in aeroplane year and sold its additives in the North Sea at least 9% less because of the negative market pressure.
The reduction of the companies will come after the decimal reduction of the market company in 2014.
The Community claims that other scarlets of society would provide space to compare the market packaging.
On the other hand, Shell ran out of his payment lists of thousands of people and announced plans to department operations on rock and land plans to 10 countries because of modernization of its processes - directly after my fuzzy with the British Energy Society of BG Group.
The energy companies are under pressure because of the lower prices of the rope, economic situations associated with the Red Decision to leave the European Union.
Member of the Parliament from Scozia Dave Anderson, on the beginning of this week, met with the advocats to introduce one of the largest job difficulties of the whole generation that led to the ship in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he led, is important for the economy in the region of life.
“In the North Sea and in the whole country, we need an economy that works for all, not only for some,” he reported in the state.
For comparison, in 2016, at least 1,4 billion dollars of investment in new projects in the North Sea, while average for five years was about 7 billion dollars.
Kepler measures the speed of the storage of the stars in the floors
The most recent mission of Keplero's universal telescope for astrône help is to get at least the full list of the range of stars from the Planeda stars.
New data helps astronoms to understand why the stars in the star doctrine are tough to various speeds, and also how the time of exploitation is compared to the transformation of the planet.
“We hope that the comparison of our results with other stars are learning more about the relationship between the star, its maintenance and even his story in its solary system," reported in the new report of Luisa Rebullova, a researcher in the Centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
Stardoc Plejada is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in the Conference are now now achieved as a growth, and almost over 125 million years.
Now it's the fastest.
In the moments of the max. speed of sights, these attaching stars will allow a large quantity of star winds.
Because these winds are moved by the magnetic fields of stars, they have a decreasing effect on them.
As the star is swallowed, her speed is deceived.
Keepler measures the speed of smoking each star so that it measures time between the detective points on stars -- similar sun-shirts.
According to the most recent data on the speed of the smoking, the larger stars are smaller than the less massive stars.
The Revolution compares the stars to tanks, most of them make pirates smaller than those smaller.
“In the ballet” We still see that the plots of the stars are massive, while those who play faster are usually very easy,” said the Rebullo.
Because the star doc is so close, it serves as a ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the quality of the star and the speed of sight.
“ The majority of us provide a cat for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, at younger and older stars, ” said Rebullo.
It's still a lot of things we want to learn about how and why the stars decline their speed and say, "Speak their tane bottles on the tomb."
Revolution and its colleagues detailed the most recent analysis of the tracking speed Pleajad in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I hadn't come to me, then would the qualification agreement not be concluded and I could go to another hospital after a few months?
Is it possible to work without logging in special education after study?
It is about me that in the assembly where I wanted to work is now a free workplace in a remote hospital, but a half-year-year-old field could be released in another place where I would like to work.
So, I don't know how the situation is to resolve the halfth time, continues to ask.
It answers Mgr. Lenka Vlk.
No legal legislation shall be required to close the qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
The qualification Agreement is a legal institution which edits the lawer of the work and may be closed between the employer and the employer to ensure the return of the costs associated with higher or exceeding the qualification of the employment.
In the health area, there is therefore a long pressure for the absence of this Agreement in order to ensure the working mobilities of health workers and not all hospitals in the present time.
According to the law No 95/2004 S., on the conditions of obtaining and recognition of a good ability and specialised capacity to carry out healthy vocational doctors, deep doctors and pharmaceutics, it is therefore explicitly paid that the participation of special education is considered as a qualification (no for its increase).
This means that the qualification agreement may be closed according to the law of the work, only if the costs are at least 75 000 Kč.
No legal legislation or no obligation to apply to specialized training.
The Law only sets the conditions of the requirement to ensure the specialised training counsel.
However, under the law, the doctor is authorised to carry out the vocational doctor as well as the required high school study, although under the law of the conditions set (the doctor is specialised in the relevant body).
The Law prevents the situation when the doctor can be used in the specialising educational education of the good practice in another specialization agreement, if its contents and the range are responsible for the relevant education programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate a period of processing, which would be responsible for taxatic situation.
However, with regard to that I don't know the nearby circumstances of this case, it may recommend consultation with the competent Minister of Health (section of science and medical vocational), as the Ministry of Health of the Law provides advice and consultation services relating to specialization and procedures.
The advisory service also provides the Czech Medical Communication, which a member should be a doctor.
Medicines from Syrian Halabu are requesting an intervention of the United States.
The United States did not have any efforts to be completed (extent part of the cities of the Government of the Army), and they did not have their effects to provoke civilian protection, citated from the letter of the AFP white house.
"We don't need slides, comforts, even or prayers, but we must therefore create an Eastern Halabe without air zone to stop attacks, and we need international actions that will ensure that Halab will not be re-accepted again," said the doctor.
The Russian forces that support the army to the faithful President of Bashar Asado have announced that from today it will stop each day at three hours of the field of Halabu to allow safe traveling humanitarian conventions.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELCH must be stopped by all military activities, air attacks and balls.

In Obama, the AFP has returned 15 of 35 doctors in the East of Halabu, already controlled the rebels.
It is written that during the fifty - year - old wars were witnesses of violence, crucial death of unreaded patients, friends and colleagues.
The world's looking at and constating how the Syrie is, but it's just a little bit to protect us.
The recent offers of evacuation of the citizens from Syrian regime and Russia seems to be easy to be lying, supporting medicines, chirurgs and other doctors.
The doctors reported that the entire month has been signed 42 attacks on the medical device in Siria, from 15 to the hospital in which they work.
The most sorrowful we have to decide who will live and who will die.
In the preparation, small children are coming to us with so serious sufferings that we need to choose among them those who are the most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't have any material to help them, they write the doctor.
Two weeks ago, four new-year-olds were cut down when the explosion interrupted the addiction of the cycle in their incubators.

Rebels who are under non-stable Russian and Syrian airports have been raised in three weeks after the sabbath, and started the protophenzi.
