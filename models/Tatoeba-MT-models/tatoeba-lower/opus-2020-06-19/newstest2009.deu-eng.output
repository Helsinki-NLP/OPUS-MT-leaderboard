The Prager Bourse smokes against business ends in minus.
After the steady accident on the morning, the robbers could correct the losses.
The transactions with the CEZ Acts have almost the half of the normal day business.
The Prager Bourse cuts like the beginning of the Sunday Offices at the breakfast of the Monday, when they are along with more six percentage points.
This time was the reason for the breakfast in the Wall Street.
It also shows the reaction of the market on the result of the vote of the American representative House, which was denied to support a stabilising plan for the financial sector.
The case of the acts in Asia
A dramatic case, on the Sunday, the acts of the offices in Asia, although the indexs could compare a part of the losses.
The index of the Hang Seng Bürse in Hong Kong lost about four per cent points during the business day, but later could be a part of the losses, thus reduced the return to about 2,5 per cent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese activities in Hong Kong, was about 3,8 per cent in Shanghai, closed the markets.
The acts at the bus in Sydney lost more than five percent, however, the loss of 4,3 per cent was reduced.
The balls in Taiwan are sank after the index there is 3,6 per cent.
"The Timing Timing for the Saving Action in the United States is insurable and will influence the financial markets around the world," so the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it is heard in China, his monetary policy is self-dependently from the Chinese Central Bank.
The inches in Hong Kong are moved on the same level as those in the United States.
The American lawyers should return as fast as possible to the negotiation stick and decrease the design for the support of the financial system by the Australian Ministry Kevin Rudd.
Furthermore, other countries would be affected by the interruption.
A bloodbad of American acts
The American representative House has rejected the plan for a support of the financial system on Monday, which should be applied to $700 billion (except 12 billion Kč).
The lawyers ignored the request of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view after the plan would regulate the fundamental reasons for financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the whole economy.
The American acts lived a bloodbad on Monday, and the major accent index described the largest income in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index sak about nearly seven per cent, a similar income was signed last in 1987.
The index has already been spoken before the vote, but it has not been indicated that the design would not be done in the delegation house, the index had made a free case.
Congress agrees: US Government may pump 700 billion dollars in the banks
The Supreme representative of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have made a larger form of a agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system.
The beginning of the next week should be fulfilled.
The American lawyers had a broadcast of 700 billion dollars (except 12 billion crowns) in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system.
However, this doesn't mean any way.
The Congress agreements must also discuss some details of the Agreement before they can be published and submitted to the end of the law.
The plan for support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American Congress.
On Sunday, the President of the Committee on Bank and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Reuters.
In the Senat, there may be several data, likely, on midnight, on the plan.
Economies should be informed that the plan is agreed to be the first significant psychological factor for the implementation of financial markets.
However, it comes to a "respect" because of the complex mechanisms, as you can help the markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have obtained a significant progress.
We have made our various views to look at how a package to stabilize the market," said Agent Bloomberg, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
Following their words, it could still be a vote on the Sunday.
The representatives of the lawyers met with the American Financial Ministry Henry Paulson on the evening night to provide its final form.
This sees an absence of non-provided hypothectic activity from the financial society who struggles financial companies in severe losses and risks the stability of the whole system.
"We are on the border of a definitive unity on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're in the goal," so Paulson.
A signal for Asian employees
The global financial crisis is clearly attached to the activity markets that are strong.
The words of the Democratic Senators of Nevada, Harry Reid, followed by the lawyer, even before the Sunday at the Congress, are trying to be a final unity.
In this case, the investors in the Asian financial markets that are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress may affect businesses on Monday.
Nevertheless, it is not very clear when both rooms of the American Congress are declined on the law, even the uncleanness of whether the negotiations in the last minute could not even be separated to a problem.
The lawyers hope that it will be disappeared in the next days.
However, the law will find some changes.
The total payment shall be divided in two parts for the assistance of the system.
The starting 350 billion dollars should be prepared as fast as possible as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the rest of money, if he has the impression that the program does not complete its function, and however, for more than 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush repeats progress in positive negotiations
The President has a veto right in this decision, however, the Congress can exceed the Veto.
However, these changes are the fundamental thought of the programme, which is based on funds for the purchase of the bad hypothectic values, which have been able to get, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their hypothecs.
"We've done everything.
The representative's house should be in the way to vote on the Sunday of the law, the Senat on Monday," the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush also showed the progress to be satisfied.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "reviews the ambitious efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of Golden Falls Screens
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leadershipman, allowed the lawyers to make a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of the employees before losses, the conclusion of rewards and a scheme for financing the plan.
The new law should also be limited to the golden case screens for society directors participating in the programme and establish a Committee to take care of the fund.
This shall lead to the Financial Ministry.
"We have worked very hard in it and have a great progress in the direction of an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," Paulson.
The plan also reviews aid for householders who have problems with the retail of their hypothec.
The Government should treat new advice in hypothecs which they buy, whereas the goal is to pay the monthly costs for the criminals and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem activities will be sold.
This will be essential for how the financial sector and the Government share the losses each other," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is agreed now or beginning next week, it is not explicit after Marek's view.
"More important is that the Congress agreed to some of them to support the plan and that they agreed to him as fast as possible.
The psychological meaning of the agreement that it comes to an agreement is the most important," said Marek.
Dule on the messers snow: MP3 Player against phones.
We consider you in your choice
While almost every MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can still be able to phone.
So, of course, it looks like it is better to buy a phone.
However, there are enough reasons for a personal player.
The choice is totally declined from the type of use and the request to the future owner.
Certainly, you're buying hard for home a good nice plattform game to listen to the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Sometimes such musical news appear not on LPs, and from qualitative view there is no objective reason for that.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regular, you may dream at least one of these.
So it is also with the music on travel, so with compacted music, simple - music in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable for a player for eight thousand crowns, but a Pink-Floyd-Fan will be very hard for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extreme between which there is enough rooms.
The selection is broadcast.
The life of the battery is also decisive.
Some good Music Players can play much more than only music, but what can phones, they do not create insufficiently.
No modern device is to use as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the symptoms, it can play music and videos, both take, it has a better, sometimes a bad camera and may also be navigated.
And if you still involve smartphones and communications, you have almost a small computer in the table.
It's a little amazing, because none of the cockpit can grill and no television photographer.
However, the Universality of the phones also brings nights.
More functions you use on your phone, so often you will need to download it.
And the playing of music is one of the greatest energy free.
Only few phones can play music longer than 12 hours, but it is much less.
In this view, music player (specially the easier) is clearly the leading capabilities.
That is why you should calculate the phones that they can't play longer than a few hours.
If you leave and phone on, you better buy a loading device for the office - it also applies to the remote devices.
In MP3 Players you will not have this problem, even the less goods keep at least 9 hours uninterrupted operations with one time upload.
There is another problem if you want to play the music on the phone.
Sorry, only a small part of the devices are available on a USB termination, and no phone can be accessed directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage disk, but only few card readers will be completed without reducing the wind storage cards used in the phones.
For players, you need no special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device over USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and Players set a music library to yourself, ordered by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices make the tree structure of the address directory, such as the Windows Explorer, can both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cown, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to serve, phones can be more
If you choose a specific device, you should be particularly considered after the time of life of the axis, memory capability, quality and type of sound and, of course, the future.
If music is for you first and listen to them every day only shortly in the street, then enough phone that plays MP3 files.
What's really about every phone.
You don't also need to control what music formats can handle a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most music you get will be just in this format.
The format is the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Increasingly it is AAC (in a format, using Apple and its iPods).
Best phones can also buy music online.
Only on mobile Internet, you need to call the appropriate pages of a provider (or another provider), and you can have a song or album.
This service may already be a harmful argument for yourself for why you should make a musical handle.
Sorry, the offer of the Provider is bad and is restricted only to quick radiohits.
The prices are not even the lower.
However, it is generally said that this type of sale of music (see it on GSM, Internet, or unreasoned Internet) will be governed in the future.
The phone takes most of them.
If you have a pleasure to listen to something, take the phone in the jacktace while the player is forgotten to home.
However, it is concerned if you always have a heading or at least a free challenge.
If not, you can return to the integrated sound speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the less MP3 player.
The biggest price of the music handy is for many prices.
The best costs usually less than 3000 crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you have already received a totally comprehensive Walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most of them that there are no normal hearers.
The best and technically exposed phones with a 3,5-mm opening for normal hair listeners cost to fifteen thousand crowns.
The property of the player remains in the easy behavior.
The most simple - and not unconditional (see selection) - player can really serve each one.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of the treatment with the previous normal box record or, for example, the player player is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an unrecommended mobile Internet and a later horrible account for data transfers.
What Device should now be able to move
Moreover, the highest phones (e.g. Vodaphone 527) are available in the rules of a slot for reliable storage media (type M2, microSD).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are rich.
But be careful.
Basis parts are usually supported only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the worst can also read 8-GB storage cards.
If you already want to have a phone and buy another precious MP3 player, then get to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
After capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Belong to the popular hearing, please take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have custom control buttons for MP3, and the comfort comes to a single MP3 Player.
At least there is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the series Walkman have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category from up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capability (except 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) will provide the MP3 player of the above manufacturer.
The first virtual provider already comes this year to the Chess.
Perhaps
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is right to provide the Chess providers practically all services, as they also are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something -- a virtual supplier who moves the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this is not longer waiting for himself.
That the Chess Mobile Functioning Providers to the most cool in Europe, we have already reported on Mobile.cz.
However, the CTU telecommunication authority confirmed that the price for a SMS is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the rules of regulation of the roaming bodies, it is likely to be a paradoxic situation - for some of the Czech Mobile Federators will be more biller than to house.
How does the prices in Czech in comparison with Europe be so high?
The answer is simple, it misss the competition that really makes a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradox, there are three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100%.
The mobile functioning providers like to smooth that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Authority (CHTU) Pavel Dvorzyak, which often expressed in the past that there was no place in the Czech Republic for another provider.
It is probably true that a classic provider with a own network has no longer more chances (and he would probably find some of the others even more frequencies).
But there is another opportunity - a virtual provider.
According to the entrance of virtual providers on the mobile function market, a clear price was made with themselves, and then the classic mobile engineers had to react.
It was still before entering such companies such as Tsco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the United Kingdom, such as in Czech.
But it has shown that there is a place for such suppliers and that these can really be successful.
Finally, you don’t need to look for examples long.
In February this, we have reported about the beginning of the virtual offerer's mobilization in Poland.
Only a half year, this provider was to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus raised up to the five largest provincies of the country.
Inter Mobiliking is the Financial Group Penta, which is in Czech under other U:fon.
The property of virtual providers includes that you can concentrate on a greater specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual suppliers need a lower customer than a classic provider.
You do not need relative high costs for building, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers are usually expressed as Low Cost firms - they offer free phone talks and SMS, however, which is often agreed with a less exciting service offer.
Thus, for example, Tsco Mobile offers at least half biller than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilizing in Poland, it can also be a good shop to set up a unclean objective group.
This provider is particularly related to men.
"The real guy choose mobile - the provider who loves them and can trust them," so David Seibert, the CEO from the Mobile Entertainment Company, the manufacturer company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland may also take place in the Czech foot.
The President of Vodafone Miroslav Cepica also says: "The Czech market is for a market segment on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small.
Moreover, he is relatively safe from the search of the service offer."
In Czech without chance, the mobile functions
However, it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile functioning chess, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem hopelessly.
It will come to a marketing in other countries of our region," says in a phone talk for the mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the Press-Press-Press-Press-Company Group Penta.
In directly, she confirmed that the current mobile functioners in the Czech Research did not contribute separately to this thought.
In the same way, she tried to do everything that no potential competitor is departed.
Your interest at the start of a virtual mobile engineer has already shown the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to be a real competitor of telephone O2 in the field of business.
"We have a great interest to offer our customers not only Festival network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And before, it's better.
In this way, we have retracted all the chechical mobile functions.
With some of them, we could already get progress of negotiation," so the President of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe now better times.
In non-official information, the first virtual provider may be expected to be expected until the end of the year.
However, it will be turned out by an unwindable wall of the smoke.
"In this moment we don't figure out that there is a full-valuable virtual offerer in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Market has a great specification against other markets.
Byslang, there is no subject to us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement for mobile.cz Vlastimil Srscheň from the Press Department of Telephone O2.
On the specific specifics of the Czech market, further providers are also shown.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrová pressor adds to a strange agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a living and ambitious project that you can continue to build."
And she adds: "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual supplier will be achieved until the end of the year.
In this moment, we must have already have a specific offer to think so shortly."
Vodafone is more attention to the fulfillment of the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Cepika says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of share of costs and infrastructure.
Even so, we look out of the view of the customers than the best.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is in search of a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the manufacturers
The procedure of the mobile functioner is easy to understand that another provider called more competition to bring prices and thus also to a reach of the wine.
So why should one such competitor improve the market income?
That the providers can go to a street, if it goes to something, also the long hin and her to disappear of U:fon.
The most strongest pressure in the direction of CHTU was at the time when U:fon came on the market, out of the T-Mobile company.
This also includes public accessible information from the CTU websites.
But now it is just U:fon as a argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemr noted: "The competition field of the mobile function market has also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile engineer.
As regards the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new actor would make high requirements on the market itself and in particular its services."
However, in view of this event of the mobile functioning providers, the absolute interests of the Czech Regulation Authorities are surprised.
It is not only about the maintenance of the CCTU, which is in Czech Leader - in the differences of the United Kingdom and other high-building States - does not have the competence to enter into the economic competition.
This includes exclusively the Office for the protection of the economic competition (UOHS).
However, this is the total problem of its total type of maintenance.
"The marketing of a virtual mobile engineer would be possible after a contract concluding between a mobile operator and a virtual provider on the adoption of the necessary infrastructure.
It was not concluded by this contract, because the offer of potential interests was probably not sufficiently interested for the classic providers," so in his answer to our request Kristian Chalupa from the separation of external relations of the UOHS.
The representative of the prosecutor would not surprise such formulation.
It is more considerable for a Authority that represents the consumer interests and, in other words, that nobody does not use its position on the market.
In particular, when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the outland where virtual providers work fullly normally, it is to observe that their market entertainment has contributed to a price in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure of the correct functioning of the market is likely not for the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, it is actually shocking, that almost has already been driving the three mobile operators who gets out of their reactions.
The question, whether it really is about a accident, is on the hand.
Just as the absolute same benzine price in tanks is sure only accident and the consequences of a hard competition fight.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs that rejected the trade against the competition, and therefore it has no reason to enter into any kind of matter.
No of the provider has a dominant market position, therefore he has not the appropriate responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile market for virtual providers may probably miss the regulatory authority for telecommunication," Chalupa reported in his statement.
The interpretation of the administrative position on the market is one of many steps.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant market, developed by the CTU, after telecommunication from the view of the economic competition.
In such a market, there is no one of the Czech Mobile Federators have a dominant position.
However, some jurisdiction experts offer another view - for the marketing of a virtual provider is always needed the agreement of the network driver.
And the mobile engineer has - logically - for his network the monopol.
It means that in a specific segment, he is required to apply a dominant position.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the UOHS that three mobile operators are in the same way.
In this context, a number of interests (including the GTS Novera company) is that they are in treatment with all providers on very similar restrictions.
The responsibility to the CTU is then a right normal trick that the UOHS is declined from all the matter.
This was already to watch in some similar cases.
Sorry, it is not able to continue the extension of the competents of the CCTU on the field of the economic competition in telecommunication, where a number of factors had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS should only know well, but they probably have different interests.
It's all right if nobody looks at
Only once the functioning of any pseudoviral providers, from which there are several others in the Czech Mobile Networks.
There are companies who express their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, which are not only public.
Normally, it is about businesses operating in the multilevel marketing area.
Other mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually required only to choose.
The science of the matter includes that the company appears as a classic company, which provides a large number of SIM cards.
As important customer, then he receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all the Chechical mobile engineers provide a similar further sale.
"If you have given cases to describe, then it can be done to a loss of contracting conditions that we will then be occupied with what can lead to the end of cooperation with the corresponding society," said Martina Kemrová on our question to this problem.
However, it is unlikely that there is no question about the responsibilities of the mobile operators.
Especially, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can act for thousands of customers.
However, no manufacturers are against such a procedure.
From the activities of these companies, they did not want to win so much, and they will also be - in the difference of the real virtual providers - not affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepique notes: "The law allows such speculations, although the services of this company only are used by a very severe percentage of the customers.
These must also accept that the SIM cards are not running on their name, so they can't be fully available as the normal clients of the mobile workers."
Although it was only that the CTU had to be at least surprised.
Moreover, there is another question for the UOHS.
Close the mobile functioners before such a procedure, why are they locked against a virtual provider?
It is to add that the UOHS to detect such activities has strong competences, and if it does not want it, it is not necessary for the statement of the providers, they know nothing of it and their business conditions would have prompted to satisfy it.
If the Chess is not the worst
As already mentioned in the text, the market entry of virtual providers made a clear price in the various services.
This is practically in all countries where virtual providers have been achieved, the classic providers are trying to prevent their disasters more or less than practically.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too smaller, or very sad market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, the regulatory organs were just attached to the interests of the mobile functioners, but those who tried to realise their customers.
Since the formal measures or non-formal pressure, they obtained that the first virtual manufacturer was achieved, and it was further.
I'm sorry, the Czech Regulation Organisms are going to be all the case as a heavy cartoffel.
Without our experiences, we can't deal with the impression that unexpectedness in the competents in these cases is more beneficial.
But we don't put the flint into the corn.
If the Background information is sounded and soon discovered a virtual provider, the Czech mobile market may be moved soon.
If an offerer allows a virtual mobile engineer to discharge, the UOHS will not remain innocent if it is going to decline other interests (discrimination).
And the Chess will finally not be able to call more harder than the rest of Europe.
The new Chess Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, the Prime Minister Mireck Topolanek made the new adoptions of the National Hymne where my home country is proposed.
The Hymne was played newly from the Orchester of the National Theatre under the guidance of Jiří Belarohlavek.
There are four versions available - with a man or a famous solgesang, in chorfashing and in a instrumental version.
The assembly was taken by Catherine King's and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymne versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can just listen to all four versions.
The Chess National Lied is one of the most beautiful hymnes.
Ready before, he said to the Czech Run function, he chose for the Solar variant songs with young, representative voices that are marking and favorable.
"For the beginning, I've tried to keep a clear diction to understand the text, so that you can understand a income," the damn.
The Czech National Hymne is the next year of its 175th July.
The Lied where my house was first 1834 on the bridge of the city theaters in the originally technical piece Fidlovačka of Josef Kaetan Tyl, the music is from Frantischek Schcroup.
It was popular, and people took it spontaneous.
The first stage of the Lied was then, after the discovery of the Chechoslovaquia in 1918 to a organic part of the National Hymne.
One of the seven state symbols remained also after the extent of the Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" Hymne
Prager transport operators also promote a chip on midnight.
The Wednesday, on 1 October 2008, will be entered into the history of the workers' transport operators as a date in which a U-board, straight board or a bus is introduced to the first travel passenger, which brings an electronic coffee in the table instead of a paper vehicle.
These can now buy a hundred thousand people who have the chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, a 90-day or a year-scupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play them simultaneously on their chip cards, while in the Info Centers and Offices of Transport Offices in the U-Bahn-Stations Museum, Möstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Lewis, Kobylisy, Rajska, Kačrov and Luka.
The Coupons are available since yesterday also on the Internet on the pages of the transport operator www.dpp.cz.
The service was taken up until the afternoon hours of over four hundred clients.
Those who used the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the U.S. stations where they had to wait regularly in long skins on their papers.
They're buying the coopon on the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen stages of the city library.
"In these positions, the travelers also are available to a shield with a loaded person, the interests in the Internet buy and the coopon plays on the card," so the writer of the project Martin Opatrny.
Besides the libraries, the electronic coupons can also play automatically on the Opencard, which are placed in some U-bad fields.
How do these automatics look like?
You are red, remember the passengers, the passengers may have noted you already in the U-Bahn stations Rostyly, Budejovická, I. P. Pablova, Florenc and Vltavsska.
"The time there is five of the city until the end of the year, but it must be eighth," adds Opatrio.
Copy controls automatically instead of the driver
The manufacturer of the automatic works from tomorrow is easy.
You only need to introduce the chipcards, and the previous copon plays himself.
The electronic coupons are not only in the main city since tomorrow, but also in the environment.
Thus, in the preside and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which, in particular, the inhabitants of the communities of the region were in the main city.
"In the cities that are integrated to the travellers have the passenger readers with which they can check the validity of the Coupons after time and zone," explains Philip Drapal from the Ropid Organization. This organization provides the vehicle plans for the Prague Trading Operations.
The prestadt buss have card reading devices in the box at the vehicle.
The chip card should not only be shown during the passenger, but the Opencard is to create a signed position on the side of the box.
This controls the driver the validity of the played coupons.
"When a passenger checks the validity of the played coupons, it is nothing easier than to ask the driver to ask these information," so drapal.
A passenger who doesn't run with prestad buses and doesn't know when the currency of the coupons ends, can continue to go to the self-management car where the coupons are played on the card.
Here you will show the information about the validity of its documents on the device display.
Sudetes requested a population decision from the United States.
In 1945, the sudden students were looking for the violation of the Bohmerwald to the United States.
This appears from a letter that is located in the collections of the South Beam's Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the United States' scroll rule.
In such a desire, some groups of Sudeddenuts have been sent to the Presidents of the United States.
This includes a letter that remains in a private archive and is stored in the collections of the South-Behmic scientific library today.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President in the letter, he should not allow the return of the "South Gauss" which has been adopted on the basis of the Munchen Agreement of Hitler - to the Chechoslowakie.
"We have understood the situation right and really wanted to be sure that the American units are not as underprinters and enemies of German territory, but as freedom," says it in a letter that is signed with the words "men whose ships of the Sudetes are in the heart."
Since the concluding to the Chechoslowakie, the Suded-Easts - in the knowledge of the Chechical National Charters - allows them to be aware of brutality, insight, insight, impression and slavery, the officer of the letter to take the American President for today and forever.
"We can't believe that you don't care about the view of a four-million inhabitants of this area to talk to a stranger state to us, the minorities are submitted and trying to be increasing, and nothing has been attached to the conviction of the Allied," is reading in the letter.
The reason why the authors can't sign, the fear of the "Tsjechian subtitles" is required.
If the President of the United States doubts that the Bohmerwaldeuts are exhausted, it is sufficient to initiative a population decision on whether the inhabitants would be part of the United States or live under the Government of the United States.
While the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the next war story is amazing, he, however, shows a good picture on the expectations of the sudden issues.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to note at least that they had to negotiate about their department from the Republic, only few of them had been a great opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and the United Kingdom would take a type of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they could just stay in the Chechoslovaquia.
It also confirms the glorious Australian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was used in the war as German buddies at the sea at the East Sea.
When he arrived at the end of the war in the British prison and brought him into a war prisoner to Holstein, twelve other boemic Germans came to him, he wanted to teach them the Chess.
"They believed that if they were home, they would come to them the Chess," so Chalupa.
Nobody of the German wars who lived before the war in Czechoslovaquia recalled his opinion that it would be delivered on the basis of the Benesh Decree from the Republic.
You don't think - then do it!
A emotically loaded campaign is addressed to carriers
The worst action for security on the streets in the Czech History.
Also, the emotically loaded media campaigns were characterised to start the transport ministry at the middle-second.
The Authority of Ministry Aleš Rhebičk agrees to reject the carriers of dangerous behavior behind the Lenkrad.
The campaigns for 150 million crowns are running in TV, radio, kino, Internet, but also on flowers.
She must take the vehicles from too fast vehicles and alcohol on the board.
And they also remember that they are invited before the traveling.
The campaign wants, especially young vehicles, motor vehicles, feet and not recently, to speak in conscience.
And what will be shown in the spots?
In particular, people who call emotions.
It also indicates the "blogue" Slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - then do it!
The words "not think" are in large letters on a sign.
And in a blood lake, the word "betail".
This means that you can pay a moment of uncertainty with your own life.
The spots will be "shocken".
The Ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the English countries, where you can see totally normal images with drastical captures of accident sacrifices.
It is promised that the incident payments and the number of transport steams are on the Chess Streets.
The spots were collected by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar broth and peits for car carriers
"For the vehicles, Motto Zuckerbrot and Peitsche is applied.
The suckerbrot means that if they go to the red, for example, the time is saving.
The peitsche is then the androying of a crime or a accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," so the transport psychology of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Korzan.
And therefore, information campaigns are needed in the price and in particular negative publication, the psychology.
Even less effective is his opinion on tables, which make the travelers attention to a risk.
"If you are opening a static table warning before a danger, this will probably be released with the environment, and the vehicles will not be worthy of it," says Corean.
Olmert would approximately return all areas in the exchange of peace
The Chairman of the Provincial Islamic Government, Eud Olmert, has expressed himself practically for the restoration of all areas in 1967, as well as Jordan, Easternusalem and Golan Heaven, if you can close peace with Palestinian and Syria.
This indicated in an interview that was printed on Monday from Jediot Akronot.
"We need to be confronted with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (invested) areas, if not all," said Olmert against the journal.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to decline a high percentage of the Palestinians (Israel areas) because it will not be given peace without this," he added.
He concluded that an eventually return would also be included in the Eastern House.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, in particular, doesn't want to role tractors or buldozers over his feet, as one of my best friends has been done, must be turned to a part of Jerusalem," spoke Olmert in playing two attacks in the city in July, with which several people were killed and destroyed twelve people.
According to the words of the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "specific solution for the temples and holy and historical places" that are on the Territory of the Old City.
"The one who wants to obtain Israel's Sovereignty on the whole city will be integrated by 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work," he continued.
Decline from the Golan Heaven
Olmert said to a resort of Israel from the Golan Heaven, which is his view after an incompatible condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the pages of Damascus.
"My proposal doesn't mean to close with Syria only and only on the basis of a refuge from the Golan-Heaven Peace," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know only well what they need to face to reach the Golan Heaven.
They will have to face their current relationship with Iran; they will have to face their relationship to Hisbollah (Shiitical) movement; they shall be confronted to the permanent support that they have to turn to the terrorism of the (Shiitical) Hammas movement, the Terror network Al-Khaida and the Dschihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, and they will be concreted by the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Does Stewards in the bus?
The law doesn't know that in a remote travel is not stopped
In relation to the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and traveling during the driving in the bus can be moved and reached.
"When we were stretched and formally holding the law, the act of a Stewards is in contrast to the law on the streets trade," says Karel Hanzelka's speaker.
The accident, at the last week, a twenty-year-old Stewards' life, was probably caused by the traveler of the LKW, who crossed the way to the bus.
The young woman sat in this moment at all disagreements near the vehicle, on the less safe place in the car, although she had yet two more places.
However, a bus can also have a accident or a smooth accident in which Steward's coffee or magazines.
A role also plays if the bus has been issued to the vehicle letters later with stairs.
If this is not provided in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The telecommunications busy of Student Agency have no stage rooms; what the director of the company, Radim Janczura, confirmed currently.cz.
"This is what we have spoken to the Ministry, and this has not approved the movement of travellers.
Afterward, we have received this, and we are going to a consensus where the journeys can go to the toilette when they have their room," he shared his position.
The law does not know Steward
"No clear legal explanation for the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation that offers the prosecutor to carry out services.
The law on the straight transport only knows the attribute of vehicles, but its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the speaker of the Ministry Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Strait Cars of the Transport Ministry Josef Pokorny said that the law has noticed that this problem is immediately detected.
"It's about whether the bus has also steel places in the product authorisation.
Then it's all," he said.
Buss are divided in the town bus, where there are steel places and the maximum speed is limited, passenger buses with steel rooms and a higher allowed speed and television busy without the highest allowed speed and sitting equipped with safe garments.
As in the aircraft, the Fachman says
The BESIP Factor for Transport Security Jaroslav Hořen is not a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards to a bus.
"In a flying vehicle, there are no many risks, the situation is comparable to the service on a aircraft.
It is not sure that the Turbulens come, and the Stewards can stand up the head."
"It's a bus smooth, then, of course, the laws of physical are applied.
Just like in the town bus or in a street.
The security of Stewards must clarify the prosecutor by internal rules," he also says that this problem will not be completely resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to stretch the services
Student Agency offers a single bus company service from Stewards.
The company works about two hundreds of people in this function.
The Director looks not as dangerous after the accident.
"But when I get the impression that Steward's employment is risking, I will strike him.
Coffee and magazines can be able to get the travelers at the end.
That would also take the costs," he thinks.
As an interest in security, the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin based on the missing of Stewards in his bus, but his society is only a fragment of lines in comparison with the student Agency.
"We don't have stewards, we're going to take care of us from the beginning.
The first or later this ends with any murder accident," he didn't excuse a year ago for thousands.cz.
That was an incredible tragedie.
In the case of a linear bus after Neapel, a young Stewards in the region of Pilsen had worked two years for the society.
The Slovakian LKW was probably disappeared without shopping from the location train and locked the vehicle to the bus.
The carrier of the bus tried to move out by a scarpe manuver, however, collided with the right preliminary part with the LKW.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Janczura fights.
"This place cannot be reserved at remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to discharge LKW.
With a disagreement for the family of the young woman, the Agency will not wait for the court, but it is expected to be a financial disagreement, but also from the sides of the crime.
A law change?
Not View
A further regulation of the movement of Stewards to the boat of a bus may bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-heading expert of the Transport Ministry has already worked for a year.
"But this is not yet a specific conclusion.
Buses are also not indetermined on the day array, even the point system, the maximum speed on the car car and the use of the phones at the vehicle," also Fachmann Horren.
"The Transport Ministry does not consider the activities of Stewards as something that might risk the safety of the travellers," Hanzelka, where the control of the bus' safety is in the competence of the police and the workshops.
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, it doesn't miss in the letter of the WestLB condition to the home workers.
With a combination of units of the Düsseldorfer Silver Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-bank can be "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Finance Group", it is mentioned in the letters known in the month.
The WestLB carried out a "competent clock" with sustainable entity in such business.
And mostly, this is a connection of the decision-making approach to further bindings in the country bank sector.
So it is reading if a situation wants to demonstrate a difficult time of action.
Because the WestLB approved is as before a military pressure.
Not only since the Commission of the EU, but also by the Office of Financial Service Survey, which the Northern Western Flander Government has clearly cleared the time to find a future solution.
From one of the likely connected between the Deka Bank, the Sparkassen census by their investment funds, and the WestLB is now the talk of the fact - also on Frankfurter side.
In addition, Deka-Bank-hof Franz Waas has made the proposal of half-year-year payment ends August, in a fusion of the house in the main country street with a country bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see sense.
However, the Deka Management Council, which will be carried out at half of the country banks and the shipping contracts, has proposed the proposal to lead to the WestLB talking on common business activities.
This may be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The conversations have been free, so it's in the financial place, just started.
From the Deka bank, which counts with its 3000 partners to the important workers at the financial place of Frankfurt, is not the first time the talk when it is going to consolidate in the Spark Sektor.
It seemed to be a moment as long as the Deka bank could be fusioned with the landesbank Rheinland Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this triangle.
Nevertheless the plans were published, the Hessian Land Government said to participate in Helaba.
The two other houses did not find each other.
The landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went in place to the Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, it has always given thought games on a connection of the Deka bank with the country banks.
However, Juther Merl, the president of Helaba, was discussed against plan games about a conversation with his house.
Independently, however, it seems to be recognised that a combination of the different houses of the public legal sector.
After the country's choice is finished in Bayern, a connection of BayernLB could first be closed to the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, this isn't a good new.
If the pressure is increased to further functions, you go and get to the partners for that.
In the south she would be most junior partners, although she had had been better in the financial crisis than the houses in municipality and Stuttgart.
A relationship with the West LB reiterated the Sparkassen and Girverband Hessen Housing, participated with 85 per cent in Helaba, proposed a rigel in the beginning of the year.
However, the North LB.
These geo-strategic adjustments are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the various business models of individual houses match each other.
In June, Merl expressed the decisive question with which business model should ensure the future capacity of the country banks, whether it was not responsible for German Sparks and Girverband.
At the end, it may also be a statement of the West LB, which is not desired to be self-controlled there.
So it is also in the letter of the state of the state of this, it will be a "all solution" for the house.
As it allows to bring the Deka bank with individual units together, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as "Italian Wedding"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is as his girlfriend with him, and then it's all different, he says.
Besides them, at the fifth-liter bearface of the March of Kaiser, a massive resident barrier and proves the 200 Octoberfeest travellers whose deep tone can produce his hair.
Elena gives Luca just a cup, then a cup.
They came from Bolóna to Verona.
From here, the busparkplatz near the Bahnhof Puorta Newova, started on this evening at 23.45.4.00 buses, "Destination Monaco, festa de Birra", was expected to be 6.30 hours.
Three buses are maintained in particular to the Italians in a bus, except Brazilians.
In an eck of the parking place, the South Americans are already singing near their fats, they have already feeded in the night.
And so, Marcoguard says that it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who carries a long mantel with Pelzimita futters and a brills with large silver balls, are the buss.
Since five years, they're going to October, three tours are alone in this year.
Last night, day on the show, back at 22:30.
On the last night, Marco says.
75 Euro costs the vehicle, the welcome shipping with Caiser Bear, referred to the Bayeric Reinforcement, the hospital security and the German traveling leader - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And they're already rounding the bus in the night, on the "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it'll be quiet in the bus to sleep the travelers.
Okay, they'll still need their powers.
It is maintained in Brix and in wood Kirchen, where some other buss with Italian characters in the car train 8 shortly before munchens are still a break.
As Marcos Group finally arrives planned at half the seventh hours at the parking place near the Teresia, there is already 50 other buses from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathered together, Marco holds a last conversation, explains the attack plan.
First: Set the yellow catch.
Then left is "Octoberfest", in Fracture, the Internet address of Marcos Reese Office: "coscerviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors go up to the bear, it's called run!", he calls Marco into the morning.
"Sleep!" Run and put the place in the bottom of the cell.
"Don't prevent, otherwise we block, and not all yellow rooms on the same board, distributing in the room."
The measure, breakfast Marco, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget drink money.
"The Security Leaders show that we're welcome!
When you leave the places, they are gone.
Third: "Ton evening, half of the eleven, find here!"
And it's going to see.
On the path, a yellow cup is attached to the trees, the skins and even on the choice of a large bayer people party.
You want to be taken for the return.
It's the second weekend known as "Italian Wedding".
There are no additional information on numbers; the talk is of 50 000 who are on the way over the alpes and in the bears, ten percent of all visitors should be attached to this weekend extra from Italy.
The munchner police is strengthened by seven police from Southern Territory, Italian liberal helpers support the Bayerian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which Italians are in the front of the British (or 60 insights) and Austrians (or 80) with the first place of carrier 200 carriers.
Especially loved by Italians is the jurisdiction.
Slow nights for the believers of Hypo Real State
The German bank system is relatively stabil, declared Minister of Budget Financies Peer Steinbrück only last week.
It is good that the policy uses the word "relative" and also influences that the German bank sector will not be disappeared from the critical developments.
Because it's now in the weekend.
The munchner immobiliating Hypo Real Estate (HRE), noted in the Dax, has a billion credit in order to reduce the turbulencies to the markets.
A person who trusted the situation said Reuters on Monday, the credit assistance was to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real State must only leave the part that they also take in response.
The money comes from private and public legal banks.
The background is lost in the daughter depfa.
The State Financial Report for long-term projects for which he had lost money was extremely shortly refined - what is not possible for the untrusted trust in the markets.
In the first half 2008, the bank reserve was 95% to 2,37 million euros, and the capital cost was also easy for 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
The achieved products and nets from financial employees were attached to zero against the pre-year period, the requirements of requirements and certain value papers and the solution of refunds in credit business for more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only, thanks to higher products from replacements of loaded accounting costs from the restructuring of ancient depfa group, and from the replacement of costs after the refund and the business care for concert undertakings, the contract was still moderate for 16 per cent.
The State Financier was first interpreted after his privacy in 1990 with several immobility credits, which were then distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Since the classic state financing was too few, the Depfa was then enhanced in infrastructure projects and funding of Community projects and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real State must now take descriptions that have an "existent material effect" on the winning and destruction of the group, it is not exactly indefinite.
It's the fact that the divisions were cut off.
She was cut off for 2007 for two thirds.
The Hypo Real State is a significant state- and infrastructure financer since the Depfa reimbursement.
She is stronger than other institutions depending on the refunding on the internal bank market because she has no customer entities.
With the collection of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit delivery is rejoiced in the banks because the banks hear their liquidity.
The Hypo Real State needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euro - the credit portfolio of the Depfa's short-term media for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real State, the financing requirement of the group with the credit is covered at an absenced time and the company "with the impact of the infringement of the currently unable to function international money markets".
From other sources, it is to hear that the money has been safe to the refund until the end of 2009.
The president of HRE Georg explained the functions that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer take the money markets for absenced time.
The Budget Bank and the Budget Budget for Financial Service Survey (BaFin) says that the market capacity of Hypo Real Estate Group is now safe.
This is to hope for actions and faithers of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamic and inevitableness of the crisis there is no conscience.
It is not even increasing that the financing should not be taken in full.
But the comparison is not to smoke.
After the late Sunday age, the enterprise was still before the insolvency, the least proceeded salvation may not be able to attach the mergers.
The activity currency increases 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
It's a good way to keep the driving cuts.
While the preliminary crimes are not moved, the courses of the neighborhood leading are clearer.
In particular, the training of the previous daughter company Württemberg Hypo is involved in particular and understanding of the periods of transition over 2009.
The Hypo-Real State-State is first a special adjustment, so their values should be considered after the clear exploitation of the bank crisis and the institution itself, which had taken the depfa crisis in the house as depending on the stability of the international financial system.
While notes, governments and less attached business banks are still ready to support the system, while it can be exhausted from a frequency rate.
Or this is what is not now expected to hope anybody -- that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports intended with the party statement, the possibility that it is now only a acceptable hope.
This must, in particular, prepare some long-term sleeping nights with the decision whether they should separate their commitments.
Cursean leaders can always use a loss for the future payment payment for short wine years later.
Sylvana and Bento Box secrets
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first school day in Tachibana Highschool, the girls began kicking: The Germany is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exhaust log tells it about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was upstairs.
I've had a bammel before school.
I live at the border of Tokios in the direction of Kawasaki and walk 40 minutes with the travel to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, for lucky I didn't walk.
The beginning of the training seems not as strictly set up at Tachibana as well as with us to house in low-sheets.
The students are driving from eighth hours until twenty years ago a short conversation round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the study started, I was on the line to imagine me.
I'm not the guy who likes to speak before people, nor before a class of 40 schools.
Because I wasn't yet a school structure, I had a old rock of my guest mom, the blue, the blue smoke and the black leder shoe.
So, in this street, I've put me before the pool and tried to say all right, 'Sayonara where she is Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany, and I've got a week birthday.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language for two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all touched, kissed, wrestled and walking, and I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my mangas.
It is a super-life word chat of Japanese girls and means "night, sweetheart".
Then I've been on my place fast.
The girl near me was very widely limited, she found a honour that the kids should sit near her.
The rest of the hour was very quiet, but when the Gong was killed, I was able to act regularly.
All talked through each other and kicked and asked me leather in the boat - it is really difficult to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, all of their bentos were packed out.
My guest mother also made me such a lunchbox - this is sometimes other than the German breakbrots.
I had roasts with shirts, small shirts, salt of eggs and alms, orst and a kind of flesh in the tofumantel.
Mostly, I didn't let the smokes that I'm here in Japan.
The things look wonderfully and smile entirely newly.
It's guess everything's really nice.
Noah, until the salt flowers are inserted, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just at Japan's schools.
Sometimes, a girl offers a young child self - prepared Bento, which then she produces specially artificially - in the hope of learning the boys at the breakfast.
I read that in my Manga comics.
I'm surprised if I can watch this here too.
'Why did the Japanese calculate,' my friends asked me when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokio.
I've always said,
"Because it's fascinating me now."
Finally, I'm reading for years in the loving Mangas.
And to understand the Comics and the Culture in it, I also began learning a little Japanese.
So I was absolutely clear that I had to go here sometimes.
Because I also have a fabel for tradition, seats, and smells.
And there's a big value here.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of the most recent technology and trends - on the other side it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't even been lost here, even if Tokio is the greatest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
Is a rat or a sheep flying in danger that means that she also takes fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: too many animals have feelings.
Only how can you check if they receive the same way if they are like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" is published since several years of the contribution of scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you hold true without evidence?"
I believe that animals have knowledge and other conscious circumstances, without that I or someone else could prove that where we can't demonstrate that other people have knowledge.
But in this case, we may hope at least because all human brains show the same basic configuration.
However, when we apply other species and consider the questions of the accuracy or generally the consciousness, we have an increasing decision because the hardware does not agree.
If a rat is in danger, it makes the same like many other animals: she is dead, flying or running.
Humans are similar to which some scientists are closed to a comparable subjective lives.
I don't think of that.
Two aspects of the brain structure are difficult to transfer our subjective lives to the animals.
To close those who are almost associated with the human consciousness of the cortex of the sincere prefrontal cortex (with its participation in the short-time period and the implementation/control functions).
This wide region is very higher developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to miss in other creatures.
At least in the aspects of our knowledge that depend from the prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge we are, and to decide and to decide the ability, there is reason to accept that the human is also different from the other primates.
Another dramatic property must be in the speaking nature of the human: Since such a large part of his life is linked to language, it is often meaning that the intelligence disappears it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
However, even if the knowledge does not decline from languages, this would be a certain influence, so that the animal knowledge may also be made, probably very different from most of our knowledge.
That is why it is difficult to determine how the knowledge of other animals can look like.
If it allows us to analyze such as an internal and subjective, not even because of the special hardware, on our own experience, it makes us his investigation for great problems.
Most of my executions are concerned with the content of the most conscious survival, but there is another aspect of the knowledge that scientificly needs to be easier.
You may examine the understanding process of animals without looking on their contents, and exactly this happens in studies about the short time of primates, especially in the visualization example.
However, in this approach, Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the neural corelet of the knowledge is more than on the cause mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also refers to the meaning of the prefrontal Cortex for the status of visualization.
What's going on for the findings?
I bring them back to that an emotional system like that the fear will be active in a brain whose own activity.
What we call as "failure" is so the mental state where we are, when the activities of the localized refugee system (or their consequences as body reactions).
Thus, the findings have been linked to the Court's regions, designing the primates, and especially to the people.
In connection with the speaking nature, we are able to distinguish and category with the words and the graphical conditions to write others near us.
For example, Antonio Damasio says that the findings of primary activities in the body feelings of the Cortex and the brain of the cerebral are similar to Jaak Pankseep, however, focusing more on the brain.
Since this network has not been very changed in human evolution, it may be participated in rate overriding recognitions.
Rein theoretically, I can't speak to it, but keep it invisible.
Pankseep arguments that appears like fear in Councils and people, may also feel in both cases so: But how can you check whether Councils and people receive the same way if they do so?
Is a sheep flying in danger if she also feels scared?
In my eyes, you can only prove the same manner of life.
As the neural comparison continues: rats and people have similar brains, sheep do not take a brain once.
But is the ceremonial responsible for recognition?
And even if you could prove this for people, how would you show it in advice?
I believe that rates and other animals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), findings.
But I didn't know how I should prove that.
And because their opinions are likely based on our differences (which the human consciousness is increasing specific circumstances and languages), I would like to consider the emotional behavior than the emotional recognitions of the Council.
Although there are progress on the neural level, if the rats and people miss the same.
As I don't learn languages and knowledge of the Council, even though I don't know if they exist.
You can keep it shortly, but I'll be better forward than always running against a wall.
I am also a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Friends for Poland and Ukraine
The President Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would immediately be made under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a confidential evidence in Ukraine and its ability to establish EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesia for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in two countries."
At the time for the building or rebuilding of the stations, streets, hotels and airports, the two passengers are behind.
Perhaps the number of EM states may be reduced by eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We have to work now with the maximum speed," said the Ukraine's President Grigorie Surkis.
"The EUFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
Another radial step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Poland Connection PZPN is suspended by the National Olympic Committee and was replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was meeting on the request of Sport Ministry Miroslaw Triwicki.
"The serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to rules," said the Triwicks of the Poland News Agency PAP.
"We have confirmed Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation will not be painted under the EM 2012."
Manipulation was judged only in the past saison only, at the end, even the launch should be moved shortly.
Commander Dennis Quaid is struggled back
She wanted to promote a new film, said in the Interview about Private - and now he was mistaken with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan, who made her married Dennis Quaid as married.
He smokes and smokes back.
Translated Rosen War at the ex-hepaar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood shooters now take an unbelievable war - in all publicity.
Meg Ryan had expressed in an interview with the U.S. Instyle in the past week for the reasons for the marriage's marriage: "Dennis was a long time incredible, and it was very painful."
The extent of the exploitation has brought them in experience after the divorce.
Launch for the soul strepthease was Ryan's Presse work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage.
Dennis Quaids reaction on his exit as an incredibly married, clearly said, "It's unbelievable," the 54-years of the "New York Daily News," that "I'm back again the story of our relationship."

Prices for airports and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnights in Europe were more than in the previous year.
In Germany, flys were even more than 50 per cent of the current study.
Flights and overnights in hotels have become more profitable - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial service leader of American Express.
The company has analysed its book data from the first half 2008 and determined a clear income in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have been increased for years, the oversights have already been improved in many places.
From January to March, the prices in 41 of 48 European cities are still in average 6,9 per cent in comparison to 2007.
Since April to June, the prices were already lower than 3,6 percent in the previous year.
The most clearly was the trend in Paris and Rome, where 30 to 37 percent had to pay less than one year ago.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "avoided American tourist".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more stronger than industrial standards such as Hannover, colds or stavangers.
In the northern city, the hotel prices have a growth of 26,3 per cent even the record in Europe.
In addition to the airport prices, the trend showed the first quarter still up:
According to the cherose defence, the passengers in the economy class in rate 7,1 per cent were paying more than 2007, the driving intensive flows were even more than 29,2 per cent.
Since April to June, the prices for aeroplanes of the Economic Class for average 12,5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, the price changes were most smaller in the Business and First Class.
In Germany, the prices were still stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, the prices were increased by 11,9 per cent, and in the second quarter they were in 23,6 per cent.
At German inland flys, the prices were even half according to the study.
The enterprise explains the reason for the pricebrush, one part of the leading economic growth.
The demands in many segments of the air market are broken.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement which liberalises the air transport between the United States and Europe is a higher competition pressure.
The signs of the appropried situation were the insufficient streets in Airlines, as well as the high number of aircraft companys that had been announced in the first half 2008 competition - alone in Europe were 24 aircraft companys.
HSV smoothed Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV tabler will be manager.
In Borussia, Luhukay does not continue to find a functioning elf.
From Christoffer Klein Increasing Brushland for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came just later in the game and disappeared with a heater on the late.
His message was clearly formulated, she was convinced to him about the lips.
He knew the hard way he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the gateway of the Hamburger Arena.

"It was a painful shirt," fascinated Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this month.
The surveys fed themselves on the Samstagnach Mediterranean, the blue sky over the Arena and the glass table on the video wall, which expressed their agreement as class pressure.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to attach this," said Marcell Jansen.
He assumes that the tableary environment is more for the unrecommendability of the Liga than for the domain of his HSV.
Management with their later obligated accounts - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the torch protector Petric, and the Jansen cut off by the FC Bayers - is quiet, but it can't be able.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.

Dunkle Material influenced aeroplane from spacesonden
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon in research for ratinglessness: Dunkle Material influences the speed of spacesons during such Swing-by-manuover.
Experts fear that the general relationship theory Albert Einsteins could not be absolutely correct.
Fast 18 years, the room flowed "Ulysses" through the world room.
From soon satisfied treatment equipment, you're going to get the cocktail.
A mysterious phenomenon of disaster - the Swing-by-Anonymy.
The Swing-by is a flying leader of roomsonden, where they get additional swallows in the gravitation field of a sky shirt, either the earth.
That is why the soldiers can compare a lot of fuel.
The European American research based on Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun-sound Ulysses.
However, what the researchers are surprised for years: the aircrafts do not hold 100% as so as it would be expected after the old gravitation system.
Moreover, it comes to unregularity in the speed.
The sounds are unexpected or faster.
The physicians couldn't explain this effect.
They baptized him with Swing-by-Anonymy.
Some experts fear that even the general relationship theory of Albert Einsteins, which describes the relationship force of material through a distortion of the space, could not be absolutely correct.
The American Physical Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes how precededed that Einstein didn't arise, and trying to explain Swing-by-anonymy with the same dark material that the astronomes have developed in the universe.
"A responsibility for the anomaly may be dark material that could also be close to the earth," wrote he.
From the existence of the dark material, the world's researchers know about 10 years ago.
Since it is obviously a relationship force that allows the effects of other sky crowds to be monitored.
She himself is totally invisible, that means, she sends and reflects no electrical radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of scientists, the dark material always makes a fifth of the whole mass of the universe.

Missus of the steelwater "with carrying to self-sexual"
The yearly committee by her grandfather has made that a woman has killed himself was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stetyians, Cornwall, received a prison stress of six years after he had eight cases of sexual misuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he regularly feeded his grandfather Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a conscience, "I feel responsible for their death."
The Court concluded that Mrs. Randle was married in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, in the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had hunted her and their eyes were connected before he had done sexual actions, while her mother was gone to work in a gatehouse.
Trerise and his wife are separated in the 1980s and he went back to Cornwall.
His grandfather's daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court concluded that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of its time honourablely for the National Trust, was persecuted by the misuse which was added to her twice in the week.
The State Officer Ramsay Quaife reported to the Court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who was a worthy surfer and a rather trainer since 2006, had been "emotional dead" and had been "their life"
In April 2007, her right father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is accepted that she has killed himself through a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle confronted the father of his daughter, who wrote a comprehensive letter, who ended so: "I've planned to feed her and to connect their eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for their death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are a extremely comfortable feticist, and for her victims it must be courageous, especially since she was only seven.
This unfaithful story ends with the self-seed killer of the victim.
It is still the fact that it is very impossible that the case of the judge wouldn't be done if she hadn't done it."
He added: "I take to know what effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, had their fact over the years on her daughter.
She would have been a lot of proverb, successful and happy young woman."
For lost data, competent employees shall be assigned
The BBC understood that the cabinet officer who had lost strict confidential documents in a ship was approved in accordance with the "public Security Health".
The man was deposited by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two external confidential documents in a ship to waterloo.
The documents were transmitted to the BBC before they were departed from the police.
It is the worst approach within the law and there is no indication on criminal view.

Accommodations See B & B costs in the eye
The British apartment companys may stand in the house after the saving of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million £.
The Government made 14 billion £ to protect Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The costs for this contribution shall be paid by all companies which received the money of students, including 59 building companys.
The Director-General of the Association of Working Companys (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "increasing", that the company and their members should pay.
The 14 billion damage will be returned last when Bradford & Bingley's credits are paid.
However, the costs at the period are calculated each year to the 700 financial undertakings that accept the payments.
The BBC programme for compensation of financial services confirmed that the 59 apartment companys were contained in this number.
It is worried that the institutions that have been carefully maintained ... now will be called to take some of the costs of those institutions that were often less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It was said that every company in relation to the investments that would have to pay, and that companies should pay at least 18% of the cost.
The Financial Ministry assessss that the needs for credit will be achieved at 450 million £ in 2009.
This means that society must establish 81 million £ for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Working Companies, shared the BBC that he believed that it was unfair.
It is worried that the institutions that have been carefully maintained during the immobiliar disaster will now be called to take some of the costs of those institutions that had been increasingly less vulnerable.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will watch all the aspects of this matter about the next weeks to see what alternatives are to protect habitats and their members of high costs."
The balances that will be fulfilled in 2009, the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, costs will be fallen for a full year, and it may be at least so much.
Since the construction companys are two-side organisations without society, their members shall be paid for the costs or by higher payments or lower costs on sphere accounts.

Ancient Ministry of Bangladesh is refused to cutting
A Court in Bangladesh has rejected an attempt to purchase the former Ministry Sheich Hasina, which means that they may be arrested if they return to the country.
Their Protectors said that the Court of Justice refused to prevent 50 million Taka ($729.700) from an employer while she was Minister of Prime Minister.
The case is one of many severe accommodations in cause of corruption against them.
Sheich Hasina's long-year-year political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released in the beginning of this month against Kaution.
Sheich Hasina should return to Bangladesh in the next week, but their party, the Awami Bündnis, requested that the military transition government should first give her unlimited freedom.
The Correspondents say that although their ability was provided to go to medical treatment in the outside, it is not clear in the framework of their freedom if they can continue to stay on free feet when they return to Bangladesh.
Their advocates say that they will now call upon the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheich Hasina Kautionsbitt because it says that she has not to get a cooking, since she is already at the shipment of the outland to be treated in the foreign country," said the lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We shall notify a jurisdiction against the Supreme Court."
Their advocates say that they need a coupon to return from the outland to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
It will be expected that Sheich Hasina will be returned to home after October 17, an Awami-Bundnis Party-President on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army's transitional government had taken the power, but in June was released from the prison to go for medical treatments to the outside.
As well as Sheich Hasina, and Khaleda Zia, all attachment points against themselves.

BskyB loss the layer in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its plan against the decision of the competition Commission to reduce its share in the competitive senter ITV.
The Concurrency Court proposed BskyB to reduce its participation to ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission had said that the BskyBs part of the competition was discharged and allowed him to be a more irrelevant influence on the ITV senter.
BskyB has obtained its share in 2006 by renamed NTL in Virgin Media, successfully to purchase ITV.
In April 2007, the Concurrency Authority reported that the purchase of the ITV by BskyB has made doubts on the independentness of the ITV, which the competition committee has moved to start an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communication Boss Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argumented to reduce the pressure of its part to the ITV, if an unreproved and transmissible measure, especially because BskyB had told to make its vote rights.
New Research in the United States State Administrator Safe
The Secretary-General of the United States has requested a special officer to recognize the reporting of the nine state officers in the United States in 2006.
It was a report of the Secretary-General of Justice Ministry, in which the actions of administrative workers were criticized.
The report was criticised to the officers of the wise house, lawyers and the former general officer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was carried out by the fears of the advocates for political reasons.
The Special Meeting Nora Dannehy should now explain whether the employees listed during the investigation have been able to prevent justice.
The serious proposals, including criminal actions, are not completely investigated or clarified, said the General inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The call of a special officer with the power to steal witnesses to the exhibition was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict started as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006, nine United States officers of their mothers.
At this time, the Ministry that the State officers would depart because of weak work facilities.
However, later, it was stated that the state officers have not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which many overseers have been allowed to consider the reports as political motivated.
Some of these state officers have been included in the judicial persecution of higher republican assembly members, while others refused to investigate the proposals on the election of the democracies.
The US State officers are therefore proposed to examine and persecute judicial cases for the Government.
You can leave every time, but you can not be disappointed by political reasons.
The damage leader of the Secretary-General of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has been rejected by the resolutions under the Court and has finally submitted his office.
A number of employees of the Ministry of Justice have also reported.
The report of the General Inspector, in particular, has made the role of Gonzales critical by having taken the "Private responsibility" for the solutions, its "representation" role and showing himself in the process "externally interested"
Other officers, including the former Prime Minister of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the food cooperation with the experts.
Meat Loafs should be honored epic songs
The Rockstar Meat Loaf should be honored during the Music Price Distribution "Q Award" for his episode Hymne "Bat Out of Hell".
The dreamer, the next week in London, accepting his special gold price during the destruction, said to be honored to be recognised.
The song, which ended nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the ticket in Meat Loafs Hitalboom from 1977.
"Coldplay" brings the nominations for the price delivery this year after they arrived in four categories in the internal selection.
The Chefredactor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there is some songs that go over such materials like time and genre and "Bat Out of Hell" is sure one of them.
The song that Jim Steinman was considered required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental part that takes nearly two minutes.
The song appeared in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979 in the sale and has reached place 15 in the Chart.
However, the Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" has been buried about nine years in the Charts and sells more than 40 million times in the world.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been resolved in the last years under serious health problems. A operation was under 2003 because of an irregular heart attack after he was broken on the bown.
In 2007, he had to absorbed concerts because of an accurate cool caption.
Afterward, he was known that he had a citizen in his voice band.
Increasing streets in the city, often forget and selling soon
New York City has thousands of main transport streets, only, side streets and other environmental streets, of which some pleasure and others are only reached.
However, it is even for experienced taxi vehicles and long-term location seats hard to say where Extra Place is, easy because most of them have never heard.
This winning streets is located in East Village and passed by the First Street North direction between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the second Street.
She is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more after a low gas than after a active travel street.
There's no street shoes.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard train plan.
This road also has its wonders.
For example, Avalon Bay, a build company that created shortly luxury buildings on the First Street.
It wants Extra Place new pflasters to create a low travel to the loads and boots that are expected in the new buildings.
Other travellers are the long-year neighborhood, which says that she is fascinated by the short gas, just because she is one of the last of the home blocks.
However, the administration of the city, which is competent for protection and creation of the habitat buildings and is competent for the streets, doesn't be interested to obtain them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Community Council in this month, the representatives of the city management and Avalon Bay have developed a proposal for the purchase of the streets through the building company.
However, the Committee prevents that the streets remain in the hands of the city, and asked a new plan that should be presented in the next month, so Susan Stetzer, the responsible in the Congregation Council 3.
"It's just a little room in the possession of the city, and we want to hear that extra place continued to the city," she said.
"It could give offers, how to repair the streets and respect what can be done by Avalon, but we also want to be guaranteed that the public access remains guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, the small streets of new pflasters and sites that are considered for a coffee, which wants to reduce the company's room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets was opened for the first time during the meeting in this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it would not want to have it unconditionally.
"The main accommodation of the Avalon Bay is to renew this disgusting gas and to make a public treatment," she said, and added that the city was proposed to selling.
Seth Donlin, the speaker of the division for building protection, said that it was actually the desire of the city to sell the streets and urged that the task of the division was more to develop immobilities than to manage immobilities.
Like his huge neighborhood The Bowery, extra place has holded something from his his historical impression.
Some believe that the streets have received their name in the year 182 as a large farm that Philip Minthorne has been divided between his many children and an enveloped country was not explored by no one.
The front of the CBGB CBGB, the pomprock-decennium closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is determined to be most known for the photograph on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones.
The Pflaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who made the photo on November 1976.
The street was full of shoots, lamps and parts of chairs, potters, flats and shoes.
Some inhabitants, including the bloggers who write about the Gentrifikation of the East Village, have received the ideas of the sale of extra Place, with the argument that this public basis, such as it is to continue publicly.
Others have glorified extra place as a saleness – a practically unchanged spliters of the city that should be left in silence.
Jeremiah Moss, whose blog is named "Jeremiah's departing New York" (subtitled with "The book of Kells: A painful nostalgic view on the outer city"), has published a part of the talk of the city's history on Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote that time: "Extra Place is a small sack gas that remains even dark through the day, and by broken metaltures of the loads, closed windows and raining rains, which are marked for weekly periods."
With a few exceptions, the street looked like so shortly at a evening.
A Council walked through the behind part of the streets, not far from the door that was led to CBGB before, where there is a worst clothing business today.
Graffiti was to see on the walls and a empty bierflasche was not far from a fresh branch of exchanged magazines.
Some passors said that they had thought soon about extra place, but they had concluded that the streets could be able to pull something.
Fields, added that, according to his opinion, some people understood the streets of the streets in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, fat and perfect.
Debates about two language training: education in English environment
In this issue of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to two languages education.
Lance T. Izumi, leader of scientist cooperators in California studies and director in the area of education sciences on the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a composer of the book "Not as well as you think: why the middle class needs a choice."
The Spanish choice is a complicated task.
Barrack Obamas proposals for training are a typical example for that.
Obama's election campaign states that "the probability of African and Spanish schools is lower than in white schools" - what is true.
In order to conclude this distancy, Obamas education plan recommends specially among others a two-lingual transition phase in education for those who only learn English.
However, Obama is the question of whether its use for the two languages education, which sets up the gravity point of education in other languages as English, is against his interest to reduce the distance in school education.
Let's take for example "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in the east Los Angeles.
Most of the schools are Spanish and come from families with lower income.
More than one third of the scholars, from which many are just shortly in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, 100 percent of students of the fourth class have made the state test in Mathe on a good level.
In addition, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in English tests were considered as well.
This wonderful success has been made with other methods than those who are prefered by Obama.
The school Sixth Street sets its deep point on check and exercise, on a constant control of knowledge and a holding that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the advance of education in an English environment. That is the point to observe Obama, so the Leader Linda Mikels.
This appointment sets a value to the nearly exclusive use of English in the community.
Mrs. Mikels, who refuses the idea of two language education, said to me that the school had a wonderful success with a student who had come shortly from Mexico. 12 months later, you would have entered the classroom and couldn't recognize him again.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large part of Latin American and other English schools?
The leads of the school would make the answer easy to this question, but the education policy positions within their own party (the national education units support the idea of two language education) and their own consecutive support of two language training advertises about Obama's answers unknown.
While he agreed that immigrants should learn English, he had shortly trivialised the subject, noting that people should stop to be worried about the laws of the only English.
Instead, he said, "You should ensure that your child can be Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the distance of delivery, he will consider carefully education models that work, instead of refusing and trivialising them.
The oil price is according to renewed breasts around the economy
The earthquake price is in the month because of the fears that even the American Safety Plan for Financial Markets could not be rich to relive the economy.
The Royal Oil Terms at the New Yorker Trade Offices have been packed at 7 per cent at $99.80 per Barrel.
Since last month, the price has been busy more than 20 dollars.
In the past two weeks, the good markets have been shocked by the Financial Turkballs at Wall Street, and also by powerful viruses in the golf of Mexico.
After the prices in July had achieved their high point of $145.29 per Barrel, they were caught at about $90 per Barrel in this month to increase the consequences of the great unmarket in the financial market.
In the month, investors have already been worried again, although the Congress representatives had been announced, they would have joined themselves on the weekend on a saving plan that should be the most important in the history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.

Humanitarian records by series in the second quarter
Inside Protector Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he was in the last eighteen years more than everyone else in Jets Trikot.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, where the Jets turned into a triumph.
"So I've never seen something," said Ellis.
After a smoking game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which agrees to the bad weather, the second quarter started.
However, when the Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, it marked the perfect attack on a afternoon in which their development cooperation made a step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for more two touchdowns, one time as a extra-defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half time.
"I didn't be surprised," says Coles about the feasts that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, not what people think."
During Favre and Coles Fangen played, he took the Protection Quarterback Kurt Warner.
Foreign protector Darrelle Revis started getting a crazy whirlwind and turned him into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started him away.
Linebacker David Bowens was worried about a loss of warner.
The last ball loss, called in Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets reversed the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shoes to 34 to 0 leaders.
These were most of the points that Jets had ever received in a fourth quarter.
When he was requested to describe the fault, Erik Manini, the coach of the Jet's coach, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
At the answers both, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter, without one point, Manni said, "Remember me, I took the second fourth more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in short time."
The exploited branch flats his world records
Haile Gerselassion from Ethiopia has shown it again why some of the best long-shirt lighters all times after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who made the streets of 42,2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the traveling on the flake course in 2:03:59, the genital was improved by 2:04:26 to 27 seconds that he had arrived last year in Berlin.
In the meantime, 35, he has established his 26th World Record in his vital carriers, where he has reached at every street from a kilometer to Marathon at least a world-management title or has established a world record.
Last month, Gerselassia left the olympical Marathon in Beijing, from fear that was probably overridden in the afternoon that air pollution could lose its asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called himself for the concurrency war in Berlin.
In fast ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on the objective - he won a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since the ships like birrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long streets, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen over 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin wins the result 2:06:05.
After his wedding on Sunday, he communicated the price race, he had two weeks ago battle in his car and so he couldn't train a week.
Obviously, he's refrigered after a break and didn't return.
"I am so happy," he said to reporters.
"All has been perfect.
I took the training back a week ago, and I had some thoughts today, but at the end everything was great."
He was criticized for that - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia Rivals from Eastern Africa - that he has organized his rents overwhelmedly, many worldwide Marathonstars are generally considered to leave himself too much on the rent leaders as if it would be a border, and the World Record on the War War.
However, this criteria does not suffer the size of smoking as long-track lighters.
Agreement of four Kenians on Sunday was the middle point of the street at 1:02:04.
Two Elite lighters from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to excuse the gemselassion after the timers left.
Some more than three miles before the Finish has made his last approach to separate from Kwambai, which has arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and that he has improved his best time for about 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
With women Irina Mikitenko, originally from Casachstan, and now Germany, has concluded a significant year, showing it at 2:19:19 the seventh-secondest result of all times.
The World Record of 2:15:25 contains Paul Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
At the last birthday, the 36 years old Mikitenko was surprised to win London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She has passed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back-sharing. However, she has reached her to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third Marathon for five minutes.
She sent her driving by spreading a quarter of ethiopics and chenians, but over 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was the second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came to the third in 2:25:01.
Honour and traps in the life of the black population, in a city of all particular types
Hidden between the expenses of the free-time park in the area of Orlando, a few miles away from the sliding, late and gigantic drives, is a quiet city in which the honour and the complications of the African Culture.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the housetown Zora Neale Hurstons, is not more easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "The city with 5 Sees, three crocks places, 300 braun hairs, 300 good witchs, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prisoners."
Today, it's a pilling place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the year's Zora! Festival came in Eatonville to remember the best author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that she describes – and which has made it to a tourist target, taking it into the Florida traveller, which was produced during the depression of the contracting project – in many regards a place of all special sorts.
Eatonville is so independent, dedicated and private as in the 1930s, as Hurston wrote that the rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their real thoughts with the wise man, who knows that he does not know what he does.
Even today, in a year in a black presidentship candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls to a open conversation on racial relations, many are still sorry to be watched by strangers.
"We are very worried about our story," so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the elderly church of the city.
It must sound."
Eatonville was defined a long time as a paradox of triumph and war.
It is a historical example of black movement and a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty's dual is as high as the middle of the country.
On one hand, it is a Hochburg of the literature and otherwise a example of the - sometimes condemned - black culture of the southern southern, which has their roots in the American slavery.
It's not surprised that inhabitants here are so honourable as well as on the hut.
And so exactly the thoughts of Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as they named all Hurston here.
She set her hometown in books who came from heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida driver changed the city that is close to the route 77, a street that leads through the frequently forgotten centre of Florida to the shadows of black story and human drama.
Frequency as Oskar as well as in the real life and in the literature, Hurston Reader led to the first citizen, Joe Clarke, and then turned to private issues.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "the brun-weeks are increasing modern schools, with their planned gardens and games, to be careful of Howard Miller, although he can not read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "All kind of selling and what-accept-alway in hour rooms."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Eatonville brought in connection with self-stream, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This wasn't a travel leader.
In fact, this wasn't a Portrait which was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things like they were," so the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson-Medics, made the Hurton, with the men sitting, the songs of their beauty, who were full sexy plays.
She added, "Man people don't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a living excentrator who regularly returned back after her family was gone to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she had done this most without warning, in a laughing chevrolet, rare and hosen, in a city, she was raised up something today on her prejudiced clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, where many of them were disappointed.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "It was never too long," he added to him while he looked in his throne, on one behind the ground that looked at the Sabelia Sea, in the Hurston, all the probable possibility was baptized.
When Hurton died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Along with the greatest part of the world, Eatonville seemed to forget them.
Although she was a single authorin, a journalist Langstin Hughes and the only black woman in Barnard College in 1920, she was assigned to Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big idea, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the world," so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows" was published in 2003.
The wind came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-shirt car travel through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the long-term two-shirt main streets of the community.
Orlandos Vorhorts have already traveled the car travel 4 through the west town border.
The proposal was extended when Eatonville had still received a hard phase in his history.
In addition, the related ideal isolation of the community has established the end.
In the fifty years, the fight against race pollution of Hass brought into the Community.
"In this time, a white boy came often and they struck orrans and witnesses to the unseen people," said Mr. Franklin.
"It was even a woman who was killed.
They're getting a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the request of the Supreme Court of Justice to exceed the integration by referring to his decision in the case of Brown against the Schul Rat as "wrightly respected instead of my race".
A resident today says that even though the extent of rating was positive in some regards, she was low to the group agreement in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"The Black Children were usually usually to be struck - I remember it - they were struggled by his teacher at the morning, and they were threatened by his teacher in the evening," so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the employed director of the common group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be so long reached, added to them until the teachers and teachers came out of the same place.
"Man didn't humble his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural cliff," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have made place for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, shooters and artists who moved themselves on foregrounds, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and opinions such as: "Why can anybody refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker began to fight on the way to Hurston’s unnamed grave and began to fight for the renewing of their glory.
Five years later, it was a loyal Hurton biography of Robert E. Hemenway in the booksregulates, and he made it again to a part of the American literature canon.
The remote project was just at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurton's old neighbors saw them as a restaurant.
The congregation began in 1988 with the planning of a Houston Festival to show what the bear could destroy with the built of the car.
Thousands of fans came to the open event two years later, and each January returned many for the fee.
A few years later, the circle turned from his streets.
"The plans of a fifth-shirt room were built up the city, deploying the whole entire speed, smoking the real citizens," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd pressed something easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote project has contributed to a change of the self-image of the city.
There were more and more accessors, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who came here since 1993, and inheims began to revalue the past.
Eatonville was arrested in 1998 in the country-wide historical register.
A new single library (naturally called to Hurston) opened in 2006 on the new planet and spectacular Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is as before a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from the city center Orlandos may sometimes feel like a low gas in the sommer rain, as small as it was based on only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(They is today to 90% black.)
External search for the history of Eatonvilles and its significance are often treated with care.
For most of the interviews, an approval in the field is necessary and some things - such as the shadow of Eatonville's oldest church, which was drawn by a wisdom, and black men in the field work - can't be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a mysterious, self-conscious teacher with a preliminary for dark root, are still afraid that their comprehensive community is missing.
Yet, at the same time when the Houston Festival was increased, there was also a higher grade in the household.
In particular, young people have to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: wonderful, with all his problems, not worse or exactly honourable, creative and flexible, alber and throughout all other races and people groups in America.
It is the highest love to this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year Edwin Harvey, who is proposed to return after the college to Eatonville to work in the city's administration or in the police who could use him some help.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-year-olds of Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right.
"The most people who only go through here will be thinking, "Ah, this city is nothing comparable to all the others," said Alondra Kenon again after a sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
This is where we are in New York, we are talking to a flow-financing.
On the first face, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were reached from the journalists and the powerful telescope screens in the Times Square, they would not be noted that they were in the middle of a debac.
They would never believe that on their heads, in the guard offices with the Glasfasts, Bankers and Hedge funders who have Monopol in New York, every day have the worst horror work day since the office of 1929.
The leathers still shoot the metal teaways from citizens and promote tablets which are loaded with muffins for the early meetings.
Latinos still locked between apartments around, like human packages with the 50 built T-shirts, which are attached to one of their shoes.
The officers still waited at the citizens' steel stages on their early balls, and it is still impossible for a weekday between 16 and 19 hours to get a yellow taxi.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new spot account on the day after the day of the world.
Although I decided to put my obligation during the rest of the afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase stampfiliale, about 20 people stayed slange.
Not to the money switchers to pay or pay money, but to the customer service scale where sheckbooks are offered, tourists ask the way to buy Macy's across and open new customers accounts.
Most before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal banks with licence", standing out of the same reason as I slay.
Instead of me, they have already taken their parts from small banks, in places from where they pendeled from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and States Island.
They had the money of such thrifts (a little a building park), genocide banks and those local parks that only have been taken in a state of Filials and said they treated their customers as family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have been quiet and free.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion, in concurrency management, and as the last freetage New Yorker over weekend, was a Wachovia, a new bank that had the spans of $440 billion, on the search of a saved buyer.
In the fear of a further insurance, the officers and laden officers brought their bars to a bank that was considered as a safe chain, a bank responsible for most of the savings in the Wall Street.
In the past weeks, normal New Yorker's finance has been attached.
A woman telephoned in my Chinese supermarket, took a lot of confidential relationship with Lehman Brothers, the bank passed by, and their extent president Dick Fuld, as she would be disappointed about a false college.
And Lyn, whose 50-year-year-old concierge of my liveblog is achieved from our common conversation teams about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my success in the money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslimian graves shipped during the law ruth in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a link director of the Austrian Right Freedom Party of Austria, and Philip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams interest, take part in a demonstration in Antwerps on the Sunday of 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cuits against Islamisation".
They take shields in the style of transport marks on which a moschee has been drawn through with a red line.
The police accuses the right extremists of the grave guard on a Muslim Peacehouse in Austria, at the same weekend at the extreme right party of the country's election.
In the night of Friday tomorrow, more than 90 graves in the peacehouse in Traun at Linz were in an organizated policy, organized action was hard.
The tattoo's Jews' symbols like David's stars on some of the graves, however, the Criminal office has been held for a trial to spread the motive of the extremists of the Hass to Muslim Immigrants.
It is not clear if the case is connected to the choices in any way.
A speaker of the local Islamic Community said that they were "sufficiently threatened" about the message of the grave's prison, which was located as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan's end.
At the same time, in Austria, a rural research of consciousness is attracted after the country in the strict election of the Parliament.
The FPÖ and the Allianz for the future of Austria, both parties directed by the right hands of the votes, were at least 30% of their votes, set in their election fight for a strict anti-Uniwater law and some of their elections were criticized by the Gentiles as an alien.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, has set up for a prohibition of heads and Burkas, and also made his refuge against food, which is generally connected to the Islam.
At his last client in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherschaft" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to make the construction of Moscows and Minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are a continual islamism of Austria and Europe.
Questions and analyses, which were directly carried out after the election, and that the extreme rights of the political most strongest blocks are in the country, indicate that this new development is inclined to young choices who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel locks for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockster, who was judged by the sexual misuse of children, was judged to travel to France and Spain.
The judges raised a six-monatic sperre after he informed his controlled authorities, he wanted to go through France to Spain.
The Police in Kent was invited to attach a foreign travel lock on the last Sunday after they had proposed the judges' proofs for the commitment of the sexual misuse of children.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, lived not at the audience of the Ashford Officer in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning law official.
The Court's speaker reported: "On Sunday, on 25 September, the police Kent in the Office of Ashford requested the authorisation to prevent outside travels from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd wasn't personally present."
As the register for sexual tractors required, the 64, the authorities reported that he wanted to go to the outside.
He must notice the authorities if he wants to leave for more than three days to the outside.
He also needs to notify the police seven days before his planned April.
The notification of the authorities may lead to a prison train of five years.
The police in Kent said that she would not discuss individual cases or members in the country.
A speaker of Kents police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and outside."
"Our view is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have an entire system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"The police in Kent is essential to protect the inhabitants Kents, and we work together to monitor the conduct of registrated sexual straffices in the country to minimize any risk that can be available for the population.
Glitter returned the last month to the United Kingdom after he was treated 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for sinful use to 2 girls in the age of 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flowed glitters to Bangkok, where he was planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thailand authorities didn't let him through the pass control, and he flew after some and her to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to go to Bangkok, where Thailand police and front offices were able to return to the United Kingdom.
Finally, he arrived on August 22, at Heathrow, and stayed there during his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Officer of Uxbridge in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully requested the approval to ask him to register himself as sexular traffics.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for four months in the United Kingdom for the possession of images of children's use.
According to the inner Minister Jacqui Smith, the Interior Ministry of Justice has been rejoiced and satisfied that the members were held to go to France and Spain.
"I recognize the Master behind the bown to maintain his characters", Gutter Brauer, Photographer.
No paragraphs, no rushes, no cohesions for the approach.
The nature of the large flamencottengers who react to concentration and turn the interpretation to get a exciting look like a woman or a man.
One Side Artist
Other side personity
I look in private lives, in these moments that are foreign for the public, I know when I can find for the person's personality, the depth of a locked view or expression of the hands that are concerned because they don't be touched to the bowls.
In his project `Flamenco-poople', the German photograph Gutter Bauer's replacement theatrical theatricals of some incentives on the bowl with songs, tangers and gitarists. From this page he was a little known for the artists.
This proposal makes the photograph a special iconography of flamencoding on different levels.
The explanation of the month's photography of the Flamenco's photography `spreads the international importance of Flamenco, which will always be greater than day to day', explains the artist and makes clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any favorable person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the board.
All normal people on the portrait are artists that are in the position of low suffering, triumph, joy and move the public.
To maintain the personality of these artists, you don't have to make photos on the bowl.
Her personality and her characteristics are in their hearts.
What I was interested to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to keep the characters of the most flamencomers with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de la Minas', came on a long journey in 1997 to photograph songs, gitarists or dances with a digital camera.
Thanks to the photo coordination function of the camera and the existing material, there are images that remember the classic photography.
The application of various stylestic means destroys the classic base of the image, as the image has the moderity and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands, will be lost: `Music with traditional roots that are changed and every day surprised'.
These are not only the dance, the single, or the instrumental game, but the personality of the artist, his character, which leads the public with his artist.
The search for the significant, after a certain thing, which is visible in the form of the hearing, of its, is and was the fixed goal of this work that is present in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Conscious persons in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Chanles, Vicente Amigo and others are the election of about seventy artists who were photographed.
The project has become anthology of the Flamencos and will appear as a book, with all portrets from the exhibition.
Builder suffering to the Portrait led him to achieve these ideas two years ago and to explore as `portraits of the Sport' ('Sportart Project').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-People' are different, the photograph of 'es is very pleased to photograph people, to learn and to interpret me in their life situation, it is for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the field of the photography, the Portrait is the most difficult gateway.
You're traveling or driving on people, personalities that you sometimes don't know, or they let you only for a few minutes to make a photograph.
In view of these circumstances, as photograph, I'm always trying to make my ideas.'
The collection of the Portrait of the Flamenco from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of El Fotomata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition can be observed until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Roman that he just writes is "a depression".
He still does not know where the action of the Roman is located and what it happens, however, Mario Vargas Llosa tried to maintain the project where he works to prevent a Roman with the Protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist of Ireland who lived twenty years in Congo and went to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, while his presence on the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the prefered Nobel Prices gave the project with which he's occupied with a "a lot of interest" and `all knows that he should not write to the Roman.'
"If I had been considered, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the Roman, so he concluded his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exhausted. In the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La City and los perros' was one of the best personalities on the third festival and made prognoses.
Vargas Llosa, the Premium of the Festival Hay Festival, and whose majority of the representatives give their voice, will be compared to the old output of our mutual friend and is seen in the Theater John Bravo.
He was presented by Felix Romeo and stated that he had a publication before himself, which was noted that the Peruan who had a wonderful mind and a great humor feeling was not enough time to perform any more: how his vocation to literature has been made out of `external non-external deficit', from `free in read' and from more than to be able to live before; how it is written and `Dizlint', to `inspiration', to `inspiration', to make its intensive works, with a number of works and translations, as well as the `free in reading', and the most of his favours, and the `discrimination' of the `s `the architective'.
The Spanish American Roman writer said that there is no way and way to measure and to know how to change the books of life, but I refuse to believe that the literature is a pure treatment, a flying experience," said Vargas Llosa, who believes that it brings `effects' and 'the people still get out of each other', so I asked the writer 'not let's go over and 'the response' for his call'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: the steel boxes fell partly.
After the accused steel fighters stated that the ground of the place was in a bad state, the steel campaign with which the feast in Pozbullanco should be concluded was launched last morning.
Thus, with the understanding of Fermin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández decided to move the steel campaign.
So the feast of the uncompetent witting was established because two of the three feasts could not be found.
On Saturday it renewed why the second steel campaign was not able to be feededed.
The group of the Matatoris came from José Luis Moreno, Curro Days and Juan Bautista, who followed and followed the stereo campaigns.
That was just a fee on Friday.
The winter was Daniel Luque, who had three ears separated and triumphed after he had left the transition with pleasure and ethics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante found two horns and one ear of the shield, which he had more learned by the galoping of his steel officer.
And the worst was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he had so bad, a majority of the public reacted at his second fight with buh calls.
In Alava, two people wanted to leave the control of their cars that were loaded with two thousand Kilo Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Alava).
Two policemans asked the cars to stop the car, on which they took the flight.
It seemed that she should not stop with the lading of more than two thousand Kilo Haschisch.
The police persecuted them and set one of the vehicles who was 28 years old, known as A. A. A. J., as reported to the inner Minister of the Basken State.
The taxed person was accused of official documents for drug trade and failure.
The case has already concluded the transport control on the N-1 area of Armiñon, when the officers of the transport policy of the area of Alava had already concluded the transport control.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the root control. The driver did not follow the indications, immediately increased the speed and tried to exceed the control.
The police started the persecution until the car reached a few kilometers on the border streets. In the moment, the drivers came out of the car to flee over a ground street in a forest area.
The police of the city Ertzaintza finally carried one of the two. In the car, Iveco Daily, the drug officers were transported 2.178 Kilo Haschisch, which was taken by the police.
The previous part of the car was loaded with hachish branches, which later were led to the exact labour analysis and to the exchange of the bands to further policy services.
Furthermore, the officers stated that the `doublet' character was, so that it did not match the character indicated in the Kfz papers, therefore, additionally, a fixion resulted in the failure of official documents.
The police of the city Ertzaintza continued to carry out the detention of the second sufferers who could flee as already mentioned, but also to determine the achievement of the drugs taken.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was carried into a police service, which will be carried out in the next hours.
Shaspieler Heather Locklear was determined by the traveling under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The shadows Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was set at this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of the traveling under the effect of an unknown medicine.
One witness observed how they tried to get out of their parks in Montecito, and reported the speakers of the travel policy of California to the magazine `People'.
The witness reported detail that Locklear was pressed after 16:30, and made a lot of dream by trying to move her car back or to the front of the parking, and when she went back, she had a few times in her sunbrills.
Something later saw the witness, which, in the beginning, the spectaculars probably didn’t recognize that Locklear was on a nearest street and went out of the car.
The witness was the person who was concerned with the needy because she was afraid of Locklears.
When the police driver came, they found the shoes sitting in their car, which would like to stand on the street and then blocked the transport.
'They seemed to be unoriented', therefore they brought the police into a specific drug and alcohol center to test.
According to a police speaker, the shadows showed cooperative, overall alcoholgenus was excluded from the first time.’The first observation of the officers, we believe that Locklear is standing under the influence of an unknown medicine, so the speaker.
Locklear was established under the intention to go under the influence of an undefined substance that could not be determined and brought in a local investigation at 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after a treatment from the clinic in Arizona, where it was treated against fear and depression.
The Challenge is that the Andalusian Connection of the United Nations Links will be complied with the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and the United States Links, has today ensures that the regional connection to education of those who will be the decision in the case of the old city Council for young and sport of Rathauses in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, the last week after he was accused to make business with families.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the andalus organization will be the one who must take the competence's competence', the Llamazares, whose steps must have the parties to the same, who is sitting as a city Council in the congregation of Sevilla.
However, the President of the VL defends the need of `transparency' in the possible investigations of the regulatory payments that Silva may have started: 'The VL always shows that such cases are the maximum transparency.'
In view of this theme, he noted that the education has a strenger ethical codex for all public emergency.
`Sangre de Mayo: Herdenbook of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galldós, Joseph Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' is the transformed version of the most famous stage of Spain against the French. This is a wonderful film in the film, with about 15 million euro investment for the training works.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to show a number of personalities and social analysis, which he has always wondered about the works of the glorious Roman writer, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarria at the beginning of a long version of the representative.
`Sangre de Mayo' with a video length of more than two-minute hours, this freety will be presented in Kinos and later shown on the telemadrid sender as a four-day ministry.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdós, ensures that his rolling work was fulfilled by the `Kindness stream'. This is what he had to thank Esperanza Aguirre, which offered him three years ago by the autonomous community Madrid, to turn a movie to the second-year-old Festival on 2 November in Madrid. In particular, because the story based on the basis of Episod Nacionales, took the job.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was established by the autonome Community Madrid for trial works, offers Garci, as he added to the “incoming opportunity” by means of decorations and appropriate clothes the image of the Spain’s “transported”, whose false leader for the battle, because the people were carried out by the fight for independentness and under the Government of the VII.”
However, the Cineast does not mean that with the financing such as by “Alatriste” or “Los fantasmas de Goya” (duely high as at Sangre de mayo), there were some scenes from the trial book with Horacio Valcarcel, which had been working with Garci almost all his carriers.
For this reason, Garci, who also was a film director in Volvera a empezar, has been involved by his regular work: he put himself on the bowl to the shooters with which you must first try to turn and to those who didn't do Casting, appeared to be `empowered and respectful, 'in one part of the call of the film director in there, helping in the Theater and in Kino to know what is happening in the Kino industry in which they work.'
Many passengers, on which he stands in `Sangre de Mayo', must be repeated before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-kandidat in four nominations (of whom he has won), is the opinion and ensures that no one of the three candidates who represented Spain in this year before the Academy of Hollywood, a young generation of the Spanish filmography. No `Sangre de Mayo', yet 'Site mesas de billar Frances' and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci expects no signs for this film.
"In the beginning you believe that you work for the seed, then you know that it's only for the time, and now you're satisfied if you have produced another movie," says Garci after more than 30 years of employment.
Isabel Bayon calls the reminder from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamencottenzer from Sevilla is a dance that also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusierin (Georgina Valenzuela), she was born in the fourth triana and when she was three years old, her family was moved to London.
She was a dance and expert for the east dancing.
She had a wonderful life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistin, Vegetarian, and seized for the discharge of the corset, which was limited to free virtual movement.
The life of this woman who has abandoned her speech at the Dancing and Ethics Revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, Isabel Bayon fascinated.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she proposed me this role that was impossible to show me."
"We have not tried to tell her life, except to keep her spirit," said the flamencottenzer.
Your dance bases helped me much in Flamenco.
For example, the dance of the smitterlings came to me like Guajira, or 'the dance of the skin' like Tango.
Her dance was funny, and it was told me that my dances are also in this Austrian area.
The incentive is calculated with two extraordinary cooperation: with Miguel Poveda, who is still singing for Isabel at one of their suggestions, as he also made it in `La Porta'; and with Flamenco Matilde Matilde Coral, who wanted to work outside with one of their ex scholars.
'Matilde plays Thórtola, a very rich person.
I'm happy because she was understood to affect my work, and I feel very happy."
The incentivation also refers to musical composition and the Gitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the inspiration of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Moron; with the percussion of El Pajaro, and Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the spectacular Johnfra Juarez, he ́s the role of the artists who were the Divas in which he always loved.'
In this work, there is also a certain way of life of this woman who has been known in such places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also in all Europe, although she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have a great influence on a certain time, and their works today no more, and they are not worthy to be considered less," says Bayon.
The proposal is found at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega instead.
The publication of the book 'Diary de un poeta recent marriage' closes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustriated exhibition of `Diario de un poeta remote marriage' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916, Zenobia married, offers a suitable atmosphere to carry out activities planned in the establishment of the Analus Council for Culture to celebrate the ‘Trieon of Zenobia and John Ramon’ (2006-2008). This objective is the view of the fifty-sixth-sixth July of the release of the literature pressure and the Today of the Todays.
Thus, the Triennium of Zenobia and John Ramón will be concluded with the new output of this work, with the International Congress in New York, with the restauration of the House Museum of Juan Ramon Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the wandered exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de light', opened in May and after which it was in different areas in Andalusia, now New York has been presented and in the history of the international convention.
The Andalus Council for Culture also has received ancient example of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', which was exposed by Peter Tabernero and was illustriated by Pacobo Perez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the andalusian world divorce.
The United States can imagine bad without Paul Newman
‘God makes perfect personality.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This set is from the shoespier Sally Field, who cooperated with him in the 'sension reporter', and from the greatest imagination of the American Kinos, which was left in the stead, came from all America to Newman with his occupied imagination and followed.
Look at what she costed to deliver Oscar to him.
And when he went back 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
However, it was a great struggle for all.
"What sometimes feels, is more than one expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford said weeping, "my life and my country were the greatest desires of his life."
No one was afraid to make a lie or to overcome.
As the 'Patter' of the Kinos and the parent country', he died in a terrible moment, in fear of terrorism and of the market assembly, in which the low-case feelings of the United States on the unexpected search for reasons to retain the weakness.
If you remain in this hard time without a training only a few people you can wonder, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda in order to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost disappointed a platonic ideal of the beauty and the truth.
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon, and founded as various losses as well as wine: from the stealing who wrote to the fight against the drugs and to the honor of his son from his first wife, who died in overdose, was founded up to the own mark of the officers and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it costs a lot of suffering to travel against a dead food culture.
A wide wheel of the surprise is urged to take up the house of Hollywood without care for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man was dead, but the whole Era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar Prices, said that the work with Newman was no longer or less than his carriers.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came out of Australia, warned Newman to mention his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the biggest of all of us," confirmed George Clooney, maybe one of the few who tried to live confidence today as Paul Newman lived: high requirements on the rightness, brings a responsible privacy living away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or unable to be in today's media school.
But there's someone who trys, and Paul Newman was a example for that.
He was divorced once and then was married with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there was a lot of opportunities to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have a filet?' he often threatened himself.
In the heavens he will be honourable that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not usually normal in America.
"For all the great roles that he played, he was not so honourable, as to the faithful marriage, the loved father, the wonderful ox, and the Philistines."
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are missing.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to make some olympical disciplines in Madrid after the seat for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask, "Will we prepare for this?"
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called a perfect road, and after my reward, she was the worst route with all the way and the way it was given.
Of course, it's a lot of distress if you would consider the evaluation and I could check it, it would not have done something clearly.
But, we're going on from the beginning to everything.
The uncle starts with the ticket ball that allows you to go first.
It seems not bad to me, but if they leave you already, they should also give you everything (inclusive chip to devote the road on the street).
So don't.
Here they can only take you the ticket (the first insight that is in it only to go to it) and (after a unexpected skin) there is the surprise! The T-shirt gave it only in the size `S' (and the second insight, because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis was decided only to buy a lot of small, lots of lots of substances?
So good, things like these are a smallness in comparison with the days on the street.
Besides that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting slide of at least 15 minutes, and also, you have to leave the rocksack.
The wait has expected more than 35 minutes, which is in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not left our backs before, even if it was solved, but it would have been difficult to get back.
Furthermore, it seemed that in these 40 minutes was waiting for rain, so that it came to try to organize a population raised and overflow the houses.
I think it's certain that some 500 people will have a lot of length, and some like I'm getting out of this chip that I have received, not once in the classification, I can already think that the outcome was wrong.
Of course, if you would ask me for a perfect straight, this street would never fall into me.
So I think we're still dreaming from a city that is ready for the olympical games
Microsoft search for a (virtual) reception
On the `Emerging Technology Conference', established by MIT, Microsoft proposed the progress of the new image identification system and the human interaction, a way of artistic intelligence without much intelligence, which is able to make some primary tasks such as taxi (or in case of Microsoft is a root planer to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it is listed during the discussion.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and visual recognition system, these `receptitivitin' can recognize how many people are in the room, who are and even remember how they were held, it can hear and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also attach the advantages after talking to the groups.
In the presentation video, a third person of the receptification, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that speaks with her talk, and that there is no company representative.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon hear.
All without the blue screen capture
Printing
It's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things that can focus on it, for example, on the next version of your operating system Windows.
This week you're talking very surprised about the Microsoft strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not so many connected programs.
Steve Ballmer stated that if the computers were issued with the most needful, instead of filling them with the commercial muscle, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be just for the winds.
Everything is only a setup if you consider that Microsoft adds one or another function and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is intended.
The Microsoft has right to lose the operating system in general, as well as the software.
As Google Chrom appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
A lot of story shows that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an invisible part, will always be necessary to work hardware and software simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband if it comes to communicate something with his beauty mother.
That's right.
The system will never go away, but you must think of his 'Death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system, for more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrom, and every day we will spend more time in the surfen than in the environment of the 'Window'.
What is the half of existing applications in the computer?
Lower is more
And Windows 7 has to be compacted, much compacts as View.
More, not so override, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more in integrating its online services that will finally be the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need that, without doubt, I bring a little example for that.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the Microsoft officers at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing automatic restriction, a shield confirms: 'Your search. Our future'. It is printed by a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the Microsoft, Google used for research in the network.
Finally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been reached in the period.
She will not be the beginning, but the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft looks for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously to the mark.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Paul Picasso was located in Costa Blue, Leonardo di Caprio had this mark in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Patte' of Francis Ford Coppola. Eventually, it is to cover a good building farmers.
When we start to tell the uncommon stars outputs, we can return to the image of a very strong man, with a spring bar that had taken up in a wander circle.
In the case, it is a typical T-shirt of tree vol, armelos and tail.
The English languages call it 'tank', but Le Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels override all other marks.
First, because of his great name, although she is named in a cross `Marcel'. The Legend states that the name's name is connected with sport and from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the loveholder of the song Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surrounds all because of its pregnant tree volets, because of its different unisex snitts and draws themselves by a small Belgian branch (aum recognisible), which have these T-shirts as detailed on the Half Section.
And attention, the Belgian company is not only concentrated on the production of `tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, Hosens from woodwolle, T-shirts with travels, babys, Mini Shorts
Moderate and beauty underwaters.
Although, it is very bad to use it as a subtract.
You're very rich.
"I will be a young mother, I will not be afraid for the candidate."
Her great meetings with her sister, did not allow her to develop their own personality.
Monica Cruz is serious, but full of life's happiness.
Today, the Sweden Gross takes their new activities in the mode very serious.
For Monica, it means more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their call.
She was in Paris in the Promotion of the Company Mango, where she lived in and also makes the presentation of the most important pressures in the mode that sponses the Spanish modem.
Faithful and amazing, winners on the short streets.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to presentate the new collection for this herbst/Winter Saison, who have developed my sister Penelope and I for Mango, and also I have visited the presentation of the second exhibition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated on the dinner in Valentinos Honors.
A very intensive work time that is at the same time reached.
You work for the Spanish house, what is your new collection base for the fourth saison for Mango?
My sister, even though I am fascinated from the 50s and 60s, there we find many ideas.
I'll go through a city and watched women, as they are clothed, as they're combining their clothes, I'm often doing it.
Tangerin, shoes, and modeders, you're a very virtual woman, right?
I believe yes, but finally, everything is in one and these areas have many communities.
Since I was small, I was clothed by the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother, to shoot my teenager's restrictions and to see their clothes.
It was great to go nearly better than to a free-time park.
Later than the dance, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we like to dances so much to have our own style in education and tests to look in the speed and feel good for us.
As shoes, when you get the costume, you are moved to the real staff role.
Finally, everything will be linked to each other, it is so much respect for the cost-designer and their professionality.
Before you've been 30 years ago, you're not in a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than you, than thirty years, I feel good.
I find that the woman will be reif, has experienced and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid for my biological hour.
I've done the things I already wanted to do since I was small, and it gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think you're gonna be mom, right?
Since long, I know that I will be mother, because that's my body, and I will be a young mother; I will not leave it.
Whatever the candidate is, I don't worry.
I'll give my child a great happiness and get it with a loving love.
Whatever the film art is, you have the works you have shared and the last year have been turned.
That's right, and I want them to be presented by the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, I am very unfortunate and disappointed and I want to have everything on the same time that you can't be immediately.
I really want that 'La last hour' and 'En search de la tumba de Christ' are first.
See how they like you
A few days ago, you've seen you on the ship with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, say nothing.
It's not that I went on the airport to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known since some time, just called me and invited to London to collect the money for Naomis NGO to a paradise for a better world. I know that two clothes were encountered from our collection for Mango to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomis a good heart.
I, as the one who knows, would tell you they don't sound.
However, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to share in the Paradise for this greatest thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handmaid, I will also do that.
To support women in the third world, what is necessary.
The vehicles that can be able to decline from the alcohol speed shall be installed by the `Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the vehicle who had three official offences because of the alcohol speed installed in his car in this system which offers him to start the car in the drinking state. If he is alcoholized, the car does not go.
The initiative has already been published in June in the last month, and it is now a part of the report of the Secretary-General of the Secretary-General.
The purpose is the re-solidation of the vehicle, therefore it is a curs for the reduction of the transport process.
Outside the General State Administration, expertise, the Transport Ministry and the establishment of the Technical Institute for Safety of Automobiles will also be participated.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the vehicles shown more than one time in the driving under the alcohol influence, they were stealing.
The `alcolock' would stop it because it is connected to the car, it is missing the alcohol content in the exited air and refused autostart when the vehicle has made the alcohol test; or if a alcohol concentration is determined higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, which will be taken by the costs of the ones who are attached to the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars issued with these devices have been prohibited in the first year after its introduction to 65 % of the rules.
In Spain, you consider that 115 people can be saved for year.
The measure is limited to administrative activities for two reasons: to take this treatment in attack before it was a criminality.
In order to improve their implementation, a legislative reform may be implemented on the common way, and it will also be required to reform the basic procedure necessary for the criminal persecution process.
The equipment on the Spanish markets is still available in no business, although it has already been built in some use vehicles and vehicles of the public transport.
Tomorrow, the advisory house will be raised from the initiative of the Spanish socialists' employees, proposed to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With britical points at 17:40 hours for the time provided by the program, besides the Presidial Chancer of the Airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF, the airport of the Spanish aircraft, with the prince and prince of Astury.
The sun went down, but their streets were still required to use the hand as the sun screen to see the king's park that came out of the air.
Directly on Gangway: the Spanish newspapers and other authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi traveler on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturian visited the city to form the official travel.
- Oh, very good, so, you can't take people from here or so.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived a couple of years here.
- Oh, yeah, very good.
But the Mexico Press knows exactly who is the prince and the princes of Asturian and knows the importance of the road.
There are many waiting at the airport and on the Red Teppich, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the sea, who give honor sale.
The chief appears to be amazing, clothed in the marinblau, and she, the princes, with long wind hairs, without normal `peep-toes', may have been reported to her that it will be expected for a DF.
Before they arrive in the room, they are lying and are prepared for photographs where the official success is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are carried up, one of the four largest in the city is waiting for them a reporter from the Mexico TV that makes a favorite shoes.
The best Premium of the mode
Probably there was no appropriate place on the world as Paris to present a premium of the mode and probably there was no significant model designer and Bonvivants as Valentino.
Mango presents the second exhibition of the mobile competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for promoting and international stimulation of young models.
This is signed with the money price in high of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winter of the first outcome, saw his signs yesterday in the Mango Philiale officer on Boulevard Houseman number 54 in Paris, and he had almost excited because of the emotional review.
However, this is the second biggest business of the company in Europe and has been opened shortly. It offers a sale area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is located in London.
So many events have occurred that you want to thank the model designer Valentino for his jury presidentship at the competition. Everything ended with a Luxus-Dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many happy people, the presidency that was organized by Mango appeared to be a speculator.
Nati, with the severe heart that was broken from pain, because his brother died shortly. He went to the room of the modem and got some smuck cases of ELAH who were attorney. He held himself in the arm of his son Luis, who was nearly two meters, and had Valentino with the dinner to join his honour.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was so a Kavalier, so that he ended with the baron of rootshild without Jackett, because Jacketts had led them to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, he was driving to the business, and had a room and a hole that she was modelled himself, and to the dinner he brought her a long, black sexy clothing. In a nightspazier through the opers, joined Goya Toledo, she showed us a room for ballet tests, so she was raised up, remembered at the old times, took a stand and made a kind of ` big more'.
Inés Sastre, the spacious passage was not closed by the rooms of the Palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
On the next morning, we could rejoice about the presentness of Oliver Martinez, a person who always calls a serious room, and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and handhelds) in the International Hotel in Paris, asked forward to have a room without room.
The stars under the starful heaven of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's the life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is no 1000, but a more opportunity to forget us the chaotic rare all-day life.
And if there are few, they are all collected in a book where it is where it comes to disappear. The book comes into the book negotiations on 30 September.
The weaker is a crime when he sings about 7:00 tomorrow, but it appears to be worse to reincome into the hectic ritmus which requires the present life.
The office calls the scanning and the computer that leads back pains.
The stress is the evil of the 21th century.
But there is no one and not two methods to fight the day creation and the problems of how you disable the work environment.
However, the number is not more and not less than 1001.
Besides Yoga, classic massage or spa treatment, Susannah Marriott in the book provides the list of all the opportunities that are adapted to the challenge and the time of each individual.
The work against the stress means "1001 opportunities to disappoint" and then comes the rest that delivers the book, in the book negotiations of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever means that it is impossible to get rest in the areas such as a workplace with a help of personal contacts, this manual reveals such faith.
Furthermore, the methods will be proposed how it remains in contact with nature or the 100% of natural receipts that lead to disappear.
If the Adrenalin is not higher in your vein to rebuild the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to add to the sofa to deactivate the brain and focus on the reading.
Talk to sleep
Some children talk night
I mean, I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children speaking during the sleep.
If it happens to you first, in the best case you will be scared, but in fact it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disaster that is called the language in sleep.
She is very broken, especially with children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you said you have spoken night.
This phenomenon can be able to come (e.g. in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (all day, one day per week, one time in the month ), the child can remember nothing in the next day.
There is no one reason to cause this appearance.
Sometimes other appearances in sleep are looking for, such as alpt dreams, panic fear nights, enuresis nocture (beats nights), languages in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned before, it may be very highly fiber, stress situations or requirements.
In any case, it's a little research phenomenon.
The frequency with which it opens is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, flex, or it can be a total part of the same (free, wine, long discussions ).
In cases, when the explanation is very intensive, it is recommended to watch the child and to take care of a specialist to check whether a problem is concerned, which fear is caused and in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disaster, so it will not be treated if it is connected to another sleep disaster that can be treated (e.g. with sleep appnoe or stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simply preventing measures:
Try not to get the child before sleep.
So, quiet game for the child and disappear stressful television programs that are terrible and something too white.
In the nervous children recommending disasters can be used to help them get some internal rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When the speaking comes once in sleep, trying to keep the rest.
Think that it's hard for the child and at the next day it will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
That's inutile because the child is unbecause, then you'll get it out of the dream.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it's quiet.
Think that if it shows trouble after a few apparences, it is recommended to be consulted or find out why the child has a reason for fear.
If they understand what it says (what is not so common), the child does not make pressure to carry out an approval and get more information.
So you can't get anything that you can do because when the child sleeps, it's unknown and can't think about it.
Furthermore, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, they will be careful with the interpretation of the information and the keys that you go out of it.
Maybe it doesn't say to the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not one time as a shoe.
That's because of a lot of fear.
So, don't worry about you, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that's just a few minutes.
Homes... finally
After a long dust track, illusions are finally back to success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played many tourcances and made it to convert one of them, and so to win the game.
The time of this convention in which the suppliers had the effort to show their ability was not very high.
After the first attack of the Gast Captain Caffmann, whose telecommunication was closed on the angle, Illushers should dominate the game, and it was a long time replaced by first clicking down with a telescope, then Hirn with a highpass, and Romein with a shoot with the foot point, to ask the deceived Danmark.
The generic manage blocked in the middle of the field and just left the Riahi lives on the street of the storm.
The beginning of the second half time should be determined with the first two Torcancens fighted by Riahi and temporaryly, and even then with the first gate for the Illusioners by Marais, who was just standing to receiving a ball that was rejected in a first trial of Debold.
However, the illhouse tower protection should not be able to enjoy his happiness and to be sent to the bank for about 12 minutes later, where its homecamers should continue to play a lot of money.
However, Danmark didn't know to use this, and made no big problems that were just a little back to deal with their protection, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ballet was very close to the late.
Sarkozy triff smooth fishers

The movement appeared on the other heads of the Atlantic Club and the aircraft channel, such as Sabel d'Olonnes, in Vendee, where the fisheries did not eject, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manufacturers of the trade ship.
The fishermen of Turball and Croisic in Loire-Atlantic solved the block of the significant total raffineries in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Sea decided to decline the time of meeting on Midnight in the Ministry before they decided on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on reactions on movement and on its participation to the debate planned in the Ministry of Agricultural and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Bretonic fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible for the national fishing Committee that has not supported their movement.
“The streak will continue”, because the fishermen will not be fulfilled in no point, and 'I don't want to go to Paris', says Liliane Carriou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.

Analysis History Paris of the Historys Meeting
The New Yorker Bürse reported on Monday after the representative room rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of the course: The Down Jones lost 6,98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the Sunday 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is set up at 777,68 points at 10.365.45 points.
What the points concerned was the strongest case of his history (684,81 points) before being signed on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade income after the terrorism of 11 September.
Following the final expenditure numbers, the Index Wednesday, mainly technically related to 199,61 points at 1.983,73, and the wide extensive index Standard &Poors 500 to 8.81% (106,85 points) at 1.06,55 points.
After the unexpected plan to save the banks through the deputy room, which should be able to re-establish some of the markets, the Wall Street was joined together, which was already attached to the beginning of the Quartal.
With 228 voices, and 205 for that, the reporters refused to the Financial Secretary Henry Paulson the medium that he had requested.
At least two of the three republists had made his plan.
“This is brought a bad image to the Congress as unable to accept a plan”, meaning Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
‘This shows how much the market numbered on this plan,’ added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days’ will come later.
“When the project is actually judged to divorce (...), it will be quick task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Anm. Red.) and other central banks to reach the crisis in the front, which would be more limited to the credit conditions”, Brian Bethune, the Economic Chef at Global Insight warned.
And Mrs. Piegza remarked how she felt the feeling of external threat yet more, that each day, who spends the rule of a financial undertakings in the United States.
After the concurrence of Washington Mutual on freetage, the American authorities planted the purchase of the banks of Wachovia by their competitor citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis was deceived and thus carried out of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Island and Germany, a sign that the markets were not only an American but a worldwide crisis, added to the FTN Financial Analysis.
The market for the basic needs is stronger.
The income of the state costs within 10 years have returned from 3,632% to 3,827% free night, and the income within 30 years last night of 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winds by points in the first telescope
On the first debate of the two candidates for the white house of the freetage followed another to find who was a victory, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs reported to the election of the Republicans and the Democratics their own efforts in this television, which should be followed by a third part of the American families.
The political analysis David Gergen assesss that John McCains was not sufficient to allow him to stop his return in the challenge demands five weeks before the President's elections.
The Gallup Institute from which a opinion was published on Saturday, which follows Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is the view that the democracy makes the best figure.
In the still unlocked choices, so Obama was with 39% as guests from the reviews, while 25% of them saw McCain as a guidler.
Obama should ensure that his proposal on the Sunday with the good performance, which is expected by his companioner Joseph Biden at first and only public debates with his rivalin Sarah Palin.
'It would be a mistake to investigate them.
She has a good instinct, but she warned this weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year McCain didn't listen to his indirect experience in the area of external policy, and it was clearly clear that the `Nativity' of his owners had been submitted to these questions that were the middle point of this first television.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he mentioned several times.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the needed experience and the needed knowledge to be president," he also confirmed.
An attack point that has been preached since yesterday in the republic election.
Obama himself stated that he represented the future.
He stressed himself shortly and precisely without to leave himself out of the stage.
He refused his ability to take good decisions and to renew the picture that has the world from the United States.
“McCain has not yet understood that Obama has already gone,” said a democratic choice in this weekend, which was proposed in the Republican, was not considered the full extent of the crisis that was laid on the "American from the street".
In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama prayed yesterday before 20,000 people who had gathered a choice in North Carolina in stream rain.
He didn't mention the words 'middle state' or 'employer' once. 'The financial crisis is made by Obama, who holds the Americans for the most appropriate to save the economy even on the border of the ground, a clear price.
'The next week could be a decisive endpoint,' estimated yesterday of the influenced democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a married member of the Government of Clinton, compared to the "good economic instinct" Obamas with those by Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the part of an eighty-year-year-old economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After he again stated that he would even make it to send the controls for 95% of the Americans instead of the swallows in Wall Street, how the Senator of Illinois considers that the creation of a potential energy independentness of the country and the promoting renewable energy, together with the introduction of a sick security system, the highest priority for him.
McCain wanted to create an adjustment from 45 nuclear power works until 2030.
The two candidates take care of the issues on the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euro), which has been agreed last night from the Congress and is extremely unfair to the people.
'Have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?'
Young and oppositional demonstrated Sunday evening on the main place of the white Russian capital, to reject the results of Parliament's elections before.
Some hundreds of white russes gathered together since the cluster of the Wahllocale on the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the political characteristics of Parliament's elections.
Although there were no results reported, many young people came to demonstrate the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The Dictor must return.’
Some give them that they have not only chosen: ‘What is it useful if they do with my voice what they want,’ says a young man.
They don't believe that the regime showing outside observers in the best light to reach the negotiations with the European Union is ready to fulfil a democratic end.
The sanctions, including the non-determination of Visa for 40 bicycles leading persons and the replacement of certain benefits, may be raised if these choices were considered as sauber.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded by the election committees and our supervisor did not have to participate in the statement," said Juri Potemkin, President of the Union's democratic forces, an heerogenic completion of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, named Alexander Milinkiewitsch, an older opposition candidate for the 2006 President's election and leaders of the pro-Europe movement, because it is a significant statement of the votes, and this is the executive.
If the Secretary-General enters the opposition to the Parliament, then because they were nominated and not selected.
But its introduction to the Parliament may be in the television, meetings in the regions and law proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty to be income in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which Russia has been strongly caused, is in a crisis, and we do not reform, we are going to be dangerous to become a Protektor of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe, which has persecuted the choice, is not recognised as valid.
It indicates that the election payments appear to be high, and that the extension of the vote in the forehead (26% of the choices of Minsk) has offered the way for each type of manipulation.
‘Have you noticed that a choice has been found?’, the leader of the Social Democratic Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the Wahllocals.
And it will be at least five deposits of the opposition in the Parliament, as well as those who are in the first respect to the proposals of the Government.'
The silence of the night is back on the october place.
In the TV, the President Lukachenko and the members of the central election committee are welcome for their success.
Subgrade - From blood that was back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday on the 10th year of her birthday, and her President, Dr. Francine Decary, had all the reasons to joy, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most safe and efficiency blood banks of the world.
And in particular, she repeated the confidence of the public, which was severely struck by the scandal from the tested blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood treasures managed by the Canadian Red Cross service were tested by the HI-virus and the hepatitis C-virus in 1980.
In view of this drama and the unfortunateness of the public, the Government of Canada led a public investigation led by the Judge Horace Krever to bring light into the circumstances that had led to such tragedy, and to establish directives to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this type.
During the Court of Justice, the Court of Justice still wanted to submit his report, several provincies have made a committee on the feet that was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservations in Canada.
In Quebec the Committee of Gélineau fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélinoeau and Krever, two blood banks were based in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is complied to Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territorys.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took their work, almost 38% of the people trusted in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Decary remembered.
The situation was humble.
With the great efforts to improve the safety of blood conservations and through the work in this area during the next years, we have reached the confidence of the public's confidence before she confesss that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec trusted in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary contains aware that ' confidence is something extremely crazy'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec is responsible for the principle of the advisory.
At that time, we have obtained a number of cases of the human form of the weakness in Europe with a new type of creutzfeld Jakob disease, this woman, which contains the direction since 1998.
And we didn't have the less understanding of whether this sickness could be transferred over the blood.
So we call on one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gelineau, which follows conclusion measures, if you don't know, and if a disease is only longer progressing, as clearly in the Creutzfeldt-Jacob sickness of the case, which is exceeding by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, there was no blood of persons who had been holding from 1980 longer than a month in the United Kingdom.
Now, a few years ago, without doubt, this disease will be transferred over blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of the view we applied through a sense.
1999 appeared a lot of precise technology on the market to recognize HIV: the Nuclear Axe Tests (NST), which can be allowed to directly in the blood of the shooter to indicate the convention of the virus itself, and not the antibody against the virus, as it was in the tests of the case.
The NST allowed the incubation time to decline between the time when the person was infected and where the first virus can be shown by our technology in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced at a least than a week.
So the risk was that some spenders could be infected without knowing, and you could not recognize that, essentially reduced.
These improvements allowed the risk to transmit AIDS through a blood transfusion in a significant way.
Today, a dose of 12 million people are infected with HIV infected blood.
In other words, it means that you need to distribute 12 million blood conservation before someone with HIV is attached.
Since Hema-Quebec distributed each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conservations, it would be more than 24 years before a case was transferred to HIV on a blood conservation.
I think you can feel that you can feel today when you get a blood transfusion or rewrite to restore health's health's headquarters of Hema-Quebec.
Our requirement for the next ten years is to get our safety.
You never know what disease managers can take into the system.
First in the past year, on the Reunion Island, the Chikungunya-Virus, which, like the Westnil virus, is transferred by insects over the blood.
We have to watch uninterruptly, Dr. Decary continues before she says that Hema-Quebec must also provide a suffice for a safe concern.
The need is exalted, because the people are old.
Since the treatment of blood fighting are aggressive, the patients often need new red body or blood plastics.
The oversight of the population also affects the blood dependent network that only 3% of the residents in the middle of the blood dependents.'
Any healthy man who is 18 years or old and is fulfilled by the rights criteria, every 56 days, so six times in the year, blood.
In the middle of 14% of the persons who are available to their blood will not be accepted because, for example, they are sick at AIDS or Malaria, and whoever is gone into a country is expanded in Malaria will be excluded for a year from the bloodspeaking.
'The 3% of this, we make it to get an investment that corresponds to the needs of the hospital households.
The missing provisions are very weird.
But the members of this speed network must renew if they are older and no blood can spend any more.
It is difficult to convince people to spend blood, especially to keep them and to bring them to regular speed.
The life is so hectic today that you find the time to spend one hour at the blood skin', Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood conservation, but also human weights, including bones transplants, heart skins, skins and holes that are almost used for severe burning destructions.
These weights are investigated, edited and encountered before they are attached to Hema-Quebec, which also administrate the only public Nabel Schnurblutbank Quebec.
In the Nabelschnur, which was considered as a biomedical accident, there is a rich blood that can serve severe diseases such as leuquemia.
For a few weeks, we feeded the invitation of our thousands of Nabels, and we planned to reject more than thousands of years a year.
“We should even begin in the next year to make it available for transplantations,” says Dr. Decary further, which describes this programme of Nabel Schnurblut as very favorable.
“More mothers are convinced to have no access” because Hema Quebec misses the means to offer this complex and cost game program in all hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in Half-Final
Montreals Impact has been yesterday, thanks to a 3-1-sheets (4-3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decided game of the fourth final series in Saputo-Stadion, with which the total officer's relationship was qualified for the half-final branches of the separation games of the first USL ligue.

Impact has to be transmitted to Whitecaps free day and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be established today.
Short says - Siegetor by Kovalev
The number 1-Trium of the Canadian Management is ready to take the saison in attack.
Yesterday night, Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn made the unit on the painter from Florida with a smoking fire, which led to a 3-2-side.
Costitsyn, the star of the event, shock a door, Plekanec gave two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparations games.
Kovalev declared the wind by shopping the only gate of the entire shoes.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warning.
I need another game to feel well."
Guy Carbonneau, in the first half-time he has been very fixed, noted.
But I think he's got the end of the game.
He gets a thirmful accident."
Charest sits on the north
The Prime Minister does not shut up before the end of the year of the election.
As the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was at the end, Jean Charest came last night to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Link) tried to be selected in the current party selection.
`The history of our last large borders in the north: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest was present yesterday with visual media at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party Quebec in Levi, where he followed all the guidelines.
During his proposal, a kind of image feeling was proceeded behind him.
Three large screens turned spectacular images of water power works, mountain works, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', land maps, etc.
Great medium like during the election period.
Without the pressure, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the elections of this heritage, even if he allowed that his calendar was very complete.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister has for Quebec, including a 'new economic rooms', which makes an unity with France in relation to work forces, a convention between Canada and Europe and Ontario.
Although she was often mentioned in the talks of the Ministry of the President, the opening of the Northern - the north area on the 49est width grade - never had been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was restricted to explain why the norths were a juwel with a great potential, but did not call a date, no investment sum or exact priorities for the next projects.
At least a few views of how to work more: especially on water energy, in the wood, but especially in the mountain building sector, the growth of the smoking countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructures.
According to the number of Mr. Charests, the northern `Nickel, Zink, Coffee, Platin, Gold, Silver, Easter, Titan and even Diamanten'.
This "zone twice great as France" is near our nearby, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our nearby, it's in us', he stated how to show clearly that he looks for a national landing room.
Quebec is very growing through his connection with the north, he noted: the gold streets in Abitibi, the technical Quebec, the James's boat.
"It's our future," he added after he had set a teatral pause to look at the big card behind.
The Northern, 70% of the Quebec area, concluded a part of the Labrador, who has always been invited to Quebec, explained the Prime Minister of the Press.
"This is a traditional manner that persecuted all governments.
There is a border, where there is no unity since a long time when the opportunity is offered, I will take this maintenance again in the name of the Government."
Moreover, “the climate change we need to re-consider our vision from the north,” he explained and spoke about the north-west phass, which will be experienced throughout the year.
Before this new geopolitic background, the Prime Minister says that it is just a responsibility to establish this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the inhabitants and the inhumans?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former Ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Letourneau (early pessist secretary of Ungava) have already submitted consultations to some thirty Communitys.
One of Benoitt Pelletier's ministerial committees, in Julie Boulet (Transport and ground assets), has taken the work.
The Prime Minister does not shut out a great assembly, 'not in condition of a gipfel', but a opportunity to make a common vision when the man is made.'
The development of the North will continue in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North Plan will be promised, regulated and environmental, he promised.
Jean Charest described this `Vision' as if they were an execution of the Liberal Ministry, who were before him in the office.
"What the liberals before us were in the office, we thought to change the requirements to new growth and development changes.
On the other hand, one of the newly replaced themes of the weekend, which was opened on the freedom with a large cocktail party on the feast of the 50th July of the participation.
One of the adopted decisions suggests to rename the power of Beauharnois in Adelard-Godbout Statuum.
“For Godbout, the Hydro-Quebec, on the reading of the quiet revolution and the exploitation of the water electricity, in Bourassa, who made the James Booth, always knew our party to determine the future”, Jean Charest explained.
In contrast, John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963, the Premier Ministry of 1963.
In relation to the project, Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest suggested that its introduction for 2012 was proposed.
"This remains among us, but I have before to be there," he trusted his party members, which are in the case of these challenges.
The Prime Minister who said in April that it was 2008, and, sure, no choice would have given 2009, has actually the opportunity to keep this heritage a choice that could be made to him from the law.
He notes, however, that his calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a shipping between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend made the Liberal Party a platform of nationalistic plans, especially from the ‘the objectives concerned’ adopted without further: the PLQ requires particularly the recognition of the ‘Speciality of Quebec’ in the consideration.
It also wants that Quebec members of the Council of the Canadian Round Function and Telecommunication, and that they have a Veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
On the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan have been taken with Skepsis.
The Chef of the Partie Quebecois, Pauline Marois, has reached the political development of the North-du-Quebec, which has introduced the Government Landry 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, when she came to the power of 2003 to interfere with them to use them.
If she had done it, "We would have been done much more today", Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (which the choice is found today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has said to support the acceptance of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is that this is not only a great suggestion," the party leader Sebastian Proulx explained in representation for Mario Dumont, who today returns from the ransom.
Letters - A country entered
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz'-minister (which Ironie) in the cabinet Harper was that allowed to say about Louise Arbour to be a 'Scande' for Canada.
This woman who carried an unexpected battle for justice and has granted all our wonders to cover with pain, says exactly much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this here with a government who has not gone home as the only one of all the countries concerned.
A government that has not considered that Omar Khadr was still a younger than the things occurred to him.
The only Government, although the fact that Canada has signed the Gener Convention, does its word and allows a child soldier to reveal in human conditions.
The only one who is sent down to a jurisdiction parodie to assess the crime of the accused.
Let us remember that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the agreement of the Canadian advocates to bring Omar Khadr to home, to get a right process in Canada.
That government also closes the eyes before the consequence: It's less interesting that a young adult after so many years of quality will be permanently broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are just here a secretary decrease of our rights, our freedom and our democracy, this word, the harper always brings like a favour before himself, and it sounds so unseen from his mouth.
So the time has come in which there is no more moral: you can miss a Canadian citizen, explore and interrupt, completely after the goodness of a Government captain, which is supported only from the minimum to this day (possibly be fully at the minimum of the 14th October...).
Many choices believe to find their help in a party preaching the works, the law and the order, but they don't see that this government has departed from what the call and the will of our country has made.
The challenge, Mr. Toews, is in this disagreement, and there is nothing different.
Free opinion - The orwell talk of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vize General Director of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orwell logic that the largest gold winning company of the world has tried to open a public transparency debate on six millions against three authors and a small middle-increasing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unparty, they will not judge the truth, especially not in the case of disagreement, but on the law.
As expected, this basic difference was completely disappeared by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to lead a public debate to take everybody into the royal round, who expects to represent one of its opinion.
As the process appears, the authors and the manufacturers of the book Noir Canada must be expressed considerable sums to prepare their protection and to fight with very unlike weapons against an army of advocates who will be paid from the nearly uncreasing tasks of goldmine.
The tactics with these unlike wars are often to destroy the protectors to ensure an agreed regulation that makes the side of the area, and also acknowledge every one who is expecting to repeat the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wants a public debate, she would have to present their view of things before the public opinion.
In the same way, in many countries in which Barrick Gold works, gang and hot, in Canada discussions will normally be issued by the expansion of ideas and not by the bottom-heeb.
So it would be sufficient if the Goldmin had opened its books and actions and opened a real debate through the magazines, media, publication and financing independent tests, could bring light to these questions.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public thinking, and he wanted the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a manual movement.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can ask a "public" debate simultaneously, and how did the opinions miss in this publicity?
It is likely to include this word in the world of the Vice-Presidents only the big payment receivers, not the Community of all Canadians; a very beautiful view of the term.
In a democracy owners have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public supporting the authors and manufacturers of Noir Canada is doing this in particular because they refuse the brutal management of goldmine.
This publicity is ready to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame that many are considered as clothes (with the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, where they required no longer to use this term.)
In view of the surreal talk of Mr. Garver, Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the foundation of truth, which is fundamental for each democratic society.
She denied the right to quote faithful sources and discuss about facts and interpretations that make the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss themes that do not hate the rich companies of this world, who else can do that then?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, she could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment which we are is, knows since long, debates and disagreements are achieved and solving conflicts.
The non-related balance of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in addition to what she proposes, there is no pleasure to a transparency debate.
This is a loss for the university, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time to take government measures that are limited to this kind of unjustly.
Refugee Action for Wall Street - Demokrates and Republicans are understanding
The Government of Bush and the leaders of the Congress, Republicans and Democratics, finally, came to avoid the greatest economic safeguard plan since the great depression of 30 years.
The new version of the Plan is more than 700 billion dollars, which should stop the financial crisis that has been shooting the Wall Street for months ago, must be adopted by the two congress officers.
The main contents are: a better control of the delegates on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the inserted public money, new facilities to include the number of houses intended by payments, and the right to monitor the chargers paid to the leaderships of the supported companies.
The American Financial Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Secretary-General Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, reported yesterday, a few minutes after the north, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress in the direction of an union that will be market-effective," explained the representative of Bush, Henry Paulson.
'It happened to protect the real economy and the American people before the curriculum of the Wall Street', the democratic explained.
"This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the triumph, the chaos, and the unclean in the day life of the Americans will be great," the Republican Judd Gregg explained.
The negotiations had been concluded during the last two hours from fear of the effect that had been renewed to the vote of investors.
The time that was agreed was the opening of the market today tomorrow.
The two American presidential candidates, which had first participated in the negotiations, showed more than the employees of the entity, but not to exceed their unfortunateness that you should take them in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barak Obama shows the addition of certain provisions for the introduction, especially those who are allowed to keep their own houses and those who relate to the holders of the leaderships of the companies saved by the State.
‘If the tax numbers are requested to receive extraordinary measures because of the unreasonable persons, it is nothing to be pleased.
But these measures are necessary, he explained the American television managers.
When he was asked on another senter if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican Great John McCain answered: 'I would like to know the detail, but I hope it.
"The guides I have read [they] show that this is a thing that we all shall be disappointed, and with whom we can come before.
The option to do nothing is just not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is equipped with the money of the assets
He comes 14 months after a crisis, with the place of an immobiliar glass, which first carried into the collection of the risk-hypotheken credits (subprime) before they expanded in further forms widely expanded (PCAA), and finally reported in a relief of the financial power and in the banks and funding institutions.
A group of republicans was that the last week was the first trial to ensure.
Since the democratics accepted that some `giftige' activities of society are safeguarded only from the government and not to be buyed, they believe that the sack gass is achieved.
In order to decline the viewing angle for all in the Congress, it is also added a provision that, if the government with this programme should lose within five years, it will then be able to retain new measures to retain the capital.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion dollars to achieve more than 100 billion billion, if the President needs it.
The payment of more 350 billion has to be agreed in a renewed vote of the Congress.
With regard to his assistance, Washington is part of the supported companies that bring him in the case of winning divisions, and which can sell it again when the storm has gone over.
The Agreement Government will have the opportunity to keep the prison procedures relating to the residences associated with the immobilier credits related by this plan and also establish the periods for the payment and inventions paid to the leaders of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like that the deputy room had already abstind over him today, and then the senate on the middle.
However, all their efforts are not yet sure that their plan will be achieved by green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this proposal yesterday, as well as on the sides of the Republicans and the Democratics.
The Republican Scott Garett, member of the Financial Commission of the room, his elections, explained that, of course, Washington doesn't understand us.
"Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not those who are in it to ask the tax payments to the box."
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress, called "The Kaukus of the Skeptic", has the things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
"First hundred economic professionals, including three Nobel Prices, have written us to communicate us, "We ask the Congress to not sit under pressure, and to be careful to overcome what way has been attached."
At the same time, we reached the evidence that it is a global crisis.
In a assembly, three Benelux countries reported partly the bank group Fortis for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The introduction of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourgs was needed after the French bank BNP Paribas had recognised that it would have taken into account its competitory in large difficulties since 2 billion euros (2,9 billion dollars) were lost in the crisis through the risks of immobility credits in the United States.
Fortis works 85,000 people and is the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest ensures.
'This is not a loss money, explained yesterday of the Netherlands Financial Minister Wooder Bos.
To compare, we have a choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the surprises and households appreciate, now when they are increasing times.'
During that time, the British Government was just in the other side of the Ermmel Channel to establish another of the financial crisis.
According to the English Press, the Government would take all running credits in the Bank Bradford and Bringley, over 41 billion (75,5 billion dollars) from the immobility credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander had known yesterday that she would buy the Philials and the Customs accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank in Northern Rock, which the British Government has to be convinced since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an englished icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was a long time his threat, nobody would say, his weaknesses.
Have the American shooter freed himself with the charmant smile from the Narcistic Spiegel?
Yeah and no.
His enemy, his sensitivity and a manifest talent has even stopped him by a power that brings a real pregnant monster to the world.
But what's a big long-term song!
Paul Newman died on the Friday of 83 years in the consequences of Lungscrebs at his rank in Connecticut is one of the last icons of the American kinos that he is golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he raised, and for the long time he was a type of rival on the lending, more careful in his vision game, even more corrupt, but exactly a apostle of freedom and the spring of dramatic conventions.
The lost blood often gives wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as a son of a German Jews and an ungarish mother.
His European roots should be one of the peaceful faces of the American dream.
Without an extraordinary Ego, outside quality character.
Because in him, a whole country that was loved in the self-made-man, in the fighter who was lost in the Pacific War, the beginning of the 50-year-old game artist in Yale studied and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television and soon in Kino.
Even this man, who fighted for the citizens rights, was also the traveler who was in 1979 at 24 hours of man's second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the shoespine Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown fackets of this secret, declining, aggressive, and against the glamour of the showbusin's sights, which will never be completely resolved.
A comprehensive man, in the most pure sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans transmitted the kinoliebhan in the weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of the reminders.
More than a half-year-year-year-old American film arts in permanent change with him.
So the charmant cowboy is returned from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) in the mind, and the young man who turns back his famous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Case on the hot bell, the 1958 filmed by Tennesse Williams.
It will be called a very short-term reminder (1990) who will be raised to his sensitive Mr Bridge, who will be spoken in his high age from a wedding, not all of their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans had the story.
This criminal, violent, violent and unexpected boxer Rocky Graziano from somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand full trick) of Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean was taken back after his death and the Newman 1956 was well known.
This sympatic ganove in the surprising The Sting (The Clou), which was designed with Oscar for the best film.
As a proviter and rare Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face was through the times, that was he.
He's still.
In his life room, epochens are joined.
The young one knows him in particular from the Kultfilm Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlope, the little ortodox trainer of a Eishockey teams.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen in 1994.
With a last role 2003 as a path of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the cross closed.
In accordance with several kinoleans who have gone out of the movie world, Newman should remain long in the satellite, and forward Hollywood, his companions, his prunk and its consensus.
The French filmmaster Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without Humor, as a living excuse to the 'Underplaying', when he assessed his expressions.
The meter wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which the roles have been so long.
However, he played strange Sunnyboys as an outside side: neurotic, alcoholic, fishlings or skins, with their perfect view, he spreads his degrees and his leading.
As a register, Newman made the unknown pages of his real feeling sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, from 1968 (see the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, designed a famous female portrait full of Melancholia.
He, who lost his son Scott through a overdose, raised his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of feing feelings and sorrow.
At the flight of eggs that were yesterday over Newman takss, his friend and his previous weaponsfriend Robert Redford (which were joined in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid), they were outside: '' His day has improved my life and this country.'
Greatness and joy of life were essential properties of the dead shoe player.
With regard to his legitimate carriers, there is also a great defense of the citizens rights, the environmental protection and the independent kinos, a member of Hollywood's advocat.
We have often seen him with the feet in the shields full of vinaigrette, sauces, buildings or other foods, and it is very hard for us, although we found it at the beginning.
The winds of his provisions flow in his stealing for children in nought.
Instead of shopping on his mythos, Newman was engaged up to the shoes.
He left his five daughters a letter with these words: ‘Your father was unbelieving thanks for his good stars.
It was a honor to be here."
And for us it was a honour to persecute the life of a so intelligent and great American shoe player.
A formal citizen, the most extreme and most.
What was produced in the account factory of & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the crime process started against John's commitment and its compliance.
In particular, the participation of the organizated criminality, and the grob shipping and business employment, and other criminal actions, including other documents disappearance.
According to the State Agency, the loaded medium for its own purposes were used from the declarations, while the rewards were often covered with failure accounts.
State money and assessments from self-management - total HOF 65 million - should be shared in the boxs of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, partly in the privacy cases.
As the audit authorities have been informed, effective accounts were submitted in respect of the exhibitors, and the Treaty should also not be fulfilled by their obligations.
A largest of the accounts should be fulfilled according to the adjoining letter.
The account blocks were buyed on the market of Josefvaros, and the rounds were rent into Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be carried out the accounts was decided north of the Plattzee, which was sent to the Istanbul Lados of John's Agreement.
In the meaning of this "Arcade Tour", Lados should make the pensions and restaurants.
He requested accounts of consumptions to provide later accounts based on these models for the young and sport minister, the Social and Working Ministry, and the own administration of Budapest.
These accounts should be manipulated most of these reports by Isvan Lados and its compliance, Andras Åri, which should be complied with our last information for the introduction of the relevant reports.
One of the targets of Lados' "Exchange Tour" was a bierlocal.
As two of the accommodation and Co accounts issued in 2003, the Gastronomy operator has affected the ninety-heading group of the United Nations Bitos Pont Agency.
But now the chief of the employment is, that a large group would not be attached to the local ones.
Another account, published in Saturday 2002 on the Stiftung Jobb Furcht, later known as a member of the Harmadik Evezred, as well as a graved form and content error.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and can not be maintained at the same time than ten persons, should be maintained according to the account of 130 guests.
The fantasie of the accounts were clearly not set a limited limits as to the Pigal Kft. A gastronomy operator, in which the book holding documents of the client Job Jüvé and Hoppá according to the Accommodation Authority.
As the employer of the employee of the hvg.hu reported, he was immediately clear that it had been conducted for failure documents when he had been submitted by the State Administration during a question of documents.
"Our company name and the staff numbers were wrong on the stem."
And further: In view of form mistakes, the fact was also wrong that the operation should maintain hundreds of people after they have a total of 11 rooms who offer so many rooms.
It was also taken on the account of the proposal, where the restaurant has not been operated since longer.
The emergency accounting fields also agreed to ensure that the Budapester Reiss office has provided only traveling in the foreign, and so they have indicated Hungarian travels on the payment account, what is the accounting practice of the company also against the language.
As it was known in the reviews, they also have taken the more value rate on the accounts, although aircraft aircrafts in a country outside of the EU are more valuable freedom.
The height of the multivalue was totally four from the Hotel Revfülùù Kft. to the fixing of Job Viewed accounts was wrong, since the operation was compared in place of 25 only 15 per cent of MwSt., and also by the workers excluded machines, which were manually writers.
Another mistake that was under the "Recommendation Leaders" was that they had given in a case "Waren Transport" as a reliable delivery, although it was not offered by the specialized company on investment, the State Administration shared with.
Other form errors - false account format, false stemel - was to think that the foundations were based on the Thirmadik Evedra, and XXI. Szazadi Cultural Unit and Biztos Ponts could be considered as failures.
Also, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sportlager Kunfehpolo, whose employee managers urged that the accounts were never made.
Another "Fehler" is under the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in the time (2001) just as the group of the Fiatal Város's Party should eat there - the massage manager said that the accounts did not have made themselves.
Conscious Failure
The other group of the account managers are persons who perceived that they should fix accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialists, the Esély Budapest Stiftung has based accounts for the Stiftung Accounts for Harmadik Evezred, in a height of HUF 4 million.
According to the officer of Collab Kft., Ludovic Györfi was transmitted to the efficient accounts.
The currently included Biogate Kft. should also have cooperated with contribution and Co.: In 2003 GmbH shall be established by the establishment of Job View, as well as the United States Atlasis Institute and President Family Family with fulfilled accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was also a few payment trades, since the accounts were immediately broken after their statement, however, forgetting that the concerns in their documents have forgotten.
The third group of the account managers contains persons that are directly connected to the accommodations.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian business manager of Delta Trio Kft., a person in Budapest, but there is not foundable equipment and vehicle trade company.
This company shall be published in the period of October to December 2005 for several accounts on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF at about 18 million.
According to the Remittment Authority, the Cash Investment Kft in Liquidation has been operated since 14 September 2005 as a buyer of these accounts.
The employer of this company was a Romanian whose companies should also be submitted by Ivan Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
After our information, Kubatov has been established during the meditation, accounts in the name of the GmbH, at the United Atlantas and Hoppá, as well as in the context of Harmadik Evezred, and their values have been cut off.
The company Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft, and the Jos-Investment Bt. should be based on explicit wish to be founded by Roman Murders at Ivan Kubatovs.
However, in fact, this company was not active, which was attached to missing tasks.
However, he could benefit from the companies: on the request of his compliance, the lawyer of Zsolt Sanzen, which was offered with the preparation of companies funding documents, he made accounts to the United States connected with the agreement, such as at Atlas and Y-generation.
In the name of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos investment and linax trade will be made in the entire value of HUF 14,2 million.
The State Agency says that Kubatov could have cut down 10% of the account sum and the more value level.
Kubatov should even have missed Szi-Beri Bt for the explanation of efficient accounts - in this case the accounts have been assigned to the accounts of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-generation and Conference for Modern Hungary have submitted their obligations to the Common Social Party Organization, Tancsics Mihaly based ("TMA").
Both of them received 500,000 Forint, but these amounts were cut off.
In order to interpret this, they have provided the TMA five fixed accounts of the Working Team Kft.
These accounts were still ensuring the office of Arpad Kemecsei in the Education Ministry.
The negotiations will now be considered by some accommodations with an understanding on the procedure of the accounting as they have already been held before the State Administration.
A sensation may be, if the primary adoption of Janus is decided to make an increasing understanding.
His previous data were very less detailed, and although he had already been assigned to report morely about everything, his conscience is still out.
The question is therefore open if this is in its interest, whether the socialists have concluded a package with him in respect of the revaluation of the majority of HUF 50 million, and if they are ready to take the responsibility.
However, it is possible that the "profits" is now played after his search was locked in prison and household rests at the low ear.
While other crimes, which have been raised by economic deficits and have not sold them, on free feet, or at least under the household, the adoption remains dismissed.
The psychology of the overseer - or why we are ready to pay more
The purchases are increasingly urgent to expenditure and to assess the bugs.
Neurologen and economic researchers of the University of New York are now learned to discover the neurological economy principles of this known and seems to be irrational.
According to one of the magazines published in the "Science" magazine studies, people want to give themselves in a competition, such as an eBay increase, and therefore they are ready to pay more prices.
The researchers tried to find the neurological scheme of this "games" with experimental audiences.
A group of freedoms should play Lotto, while the other participated in a player action - in two cases, the active cerebral regions of the tests were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In two games, the participants could win money, however, had a higher activity of the street, a complex below the brain, measured by losers of the auction, where the overseer of the brain plays a significant role.
Besides many other functions, this cerebral region is responsible for the "self-appointment" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price higher was explained by the explanation of a superreaction of the Stritum.
In order to strengthen their teas, the economics in the research group have also established additional researchs to persecution of the money.
In this case, three groups should include different conditions against a partner.
The control group has been reported to the true value of the product, then they have made their instructions.
Another group was promised for $15, for the case they're going to be winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction that were also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between both groups is just in the fact that the consent of one on the win, while the other was on the loss.
As a evidence for the external hypothesis referred to by neurologues, but the members of the group of the "perseases" were prepared to higher instructions than those in the control or the "Guin" group.
"This results are not allowed by no previous economic theory.
These are, therefore, based on the conduct observed in the audiences only with the joy of wines, or the risk overcome.
The contrary between these two theories was resolved through the neurological procedures that we now have prepared a third statement" - Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor looking for?
In the world, a half-billion people are under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the causes of death.
The number of infected countries shall be estimated to hundred thousand, however, only seven thousand are treated that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collection claim for various virus, infected leverage diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - living increasing and vegetables are often, however, differences and disease are different from each other.
The hepatitis A and E are extended to two different types of hepatitis A and E by the treatment (e.g. by polluted food or water), with hepatitis B, C and D can be transferred by blood and other body fluids (e.g. Sperma, separate or bird).
Traveling will be recommended to be rejected against the Viren A and B, in any case there is no infections against the virus C.
The symptoms in the hepatitis A are shown about two-3 weeks after the exposure of the polluted food and will be joined in general of unnecessary, weaknesses, bathrooms and breaches.
Then the yellow smoke is opened on the wood and in the eyes, the throne will be held, the dark orn, and the gift can lead to two-three weeks.
In the world, about 1 million people are divorced by hepatitis B, along of severe diseases such as levercrebs and leberzirrhose.
The main reason is that, according to estimations, only each ten infected in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have severe consequences: unbehaviour can lead it to levercerrhose and levercrebs.
Most infected don't know once about their disease, because the relief of the liver cells has been thickly destroyed - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
It is therefore legal prospects, such as regular control investigations.
There are three groups in which this disease often occurs: those who have submitted a blood transfusion are dependent on drugs, and attempts.
Currently the number of chronic hepatitis C patients is estimated at the world at 200 million.
Since the disease is already revealable in a routine laboratory investigation, it is ratified to visit the first unknown origin in the household.
Justice recognised, the disease can be healed, the virus can be explored through the infection risk and prevention of the disease.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004, has been established on the first time of patients in the world.
The purpose of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of these cronical living rates caused by virus, to strengthen their understanding and the importance of the pre-identification.
Have faith less pain?
As the most recent research results that religious faith works as a kind of "health" that has already to improve the death of the Catholic Martyrs.
Scientifics of the Oxford University have conducted an interesting experience: It was investigated while the faith in God affects the smile fighting of humans, reported the British book "Telegraph".
During the most amazing research, 12 faithful and atheists have received electroscocks, while they studied a parent of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers could disable the largest of the pains.
In the meaning of a brain-scan technology, the Catholics could also be indicated that they could activate the part of their brain, which is compatible with the pain regulation.
The investigation was the first in a research project, which also involved the philosophy and theologists of various divisions of the university.
When trying, an operating device was linked to the left hand, which the electroscocks were cut off.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two areas: to one image of God's mother, drawn by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vinci "Dame with Hermelin".
Researchers hoped that the view of the younger Mary's younger brother would call a kind of religious trance, while they chose Vinci image because it was almost different from the other grounds and was considered to be amazing.
The trial persons have been a half hour in a MRI scanner, and they have received 20 electroscocks in four steps, while they should view the religious, or the other fields.
The Catholics reported that they had been feeling "in security" when God's mother had seen as if they were "be surprised", and they would have been "good and peace".
During the view of the religious field, they reported more than 12% of pains than if they had Leonardo's work before their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the try, meaned that you could also make similar effects with others, strong efficiency images also to the atheists, should only find the corresponding picture.
"We need to find a picture that solve very positive findings like a mother or a father," so the psychologist.
The English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and also do it in many cases," Wright.
After these expensive results, the question remains only what effect a Madonna image Leonardo or another comparable males had on the painful regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality girlfriend Mary get better results?
You're what you're telling about.
Instead of her tenth birthdays, Google can say with fug and right: she is to find in the boards of people exactly as about their heads in the sky: you know where people have carried their ability to go to what fabrics they moved, and what they moved.
And that's not yet enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business managers.
In the direction of Skeptickers, which are planned by Orwell's horrorvisions, he allows us to correct: these would just overview the meaning of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt recently mentioned that the Google's main target was, to collect more personal data about users and to come closer to the original purpose of the company, where they wanted to "organize all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that Google was still at the beginning of the information collection after ten years.
Ask after the Status Quo in five years, he said smidt: He wanted to be Google in the position, questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What job really is going to me?", however, the software programs are not yet in the way they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are clear that in their Internet searchs they would register the search strings, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalised Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search process and to reach it later, so that the travellers may be very precisely generated later, and the same logic also based on the "Recommendations" with which the system recommends products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users ask what happens in the case of a data use - "When you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google datamonopols.
However, in most cases, it is more than the potential power represented by the company, the fear reached, and less the feeling of sin or fear of disagreement, the disagreement of freedom or the refugee against the power that leads to many Internet exploitors.
However, it is a statement that the search terms are not only stored, but also in the case of the third, and in these cases there are no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example for this was a long time the action against Pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google of the Brazilian Government has provided information collected by the Community site named "Orkut" and also allowed a identification of the Pédophiles.
In order to maintain personal rights, but in May, the EFF has successfully gone against the FBI before the Court, but Google can also be made in the future with no point of conscience to provide information to the FBI on secret request.
(Anyway, the Agreement Government has successfully affected the exposure of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in relation to the younger protection protection for years, however, it has been introduced the list of individual users, in relation to their web and search list in two months.)
Googles Images remains increasingly: those who expose their personal data, as they fear the loss of their privacy and intimspearies, are increasing the companies with the companies who are conserved with the companies that are conserved by the use of the Google services.
The American "Geek Culture", which is presented in many countries, and increasing computers, activists and users, enters the next generation of "cool companies" in them, in accordance with Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight the same goal.
A possible reason is that Google does not require its users in accordance with Microsoft identification codes and provides its services without accession, so that a open, constant updated source code and software packages appear to be along attractive, younger and cooler as the official practices of the software gigants.
On the other hand, the greeks look at the problem relationship of personal rights and the Internet measuring charf - a relationship, especially in the past years, through the label "Web 2.0" in the middle point.
In "Web 2.0", it does not matter anything else than to cooperation, speak, the users leave aspects and use the available communication channels, and even if the expenditures are separately different, the main fact remains the same to show themselves publicly.
A average younger can handle its profile - from Facebook over Xanga, can connect to other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and will finally connect to a follow-up system such as friendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically show the most recent photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of more exampleful cases shows: In view of the party photos of the last night, the girl finds quickly out with whose unbelievable friend, or the worker will leave, because he only makes his mistake in his blog on the driving air - one is sure: the term "private sphere" has been interpreted in the middle day.
The one who leads a online life is what he predicts from himself - so you can form the basic ideas behind the behavior of the young man today.
And whoever trys to keep something secret, or around the Google Monopol, you can like to do this -- like Scroogle, a tool that accesss to Google search machines, however, it doesn't look forward.
Not a few people record not on Community pages that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be used with alternative versions that are connected to no large server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion is waiting forward until Google shows your real face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca Cola (USD 110 billion), which ensures Adwords/AdSense the introduction of the offices, and they are not only prepared for Microsoft but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the emphasisable fields: So the concert leadership has rejected a protest of the cooperators since the offers of the firm child guarantees were doubled, and also the management that the multiple worker's workers had to be able to be able to make it easy, but it must be very courageous to say that Google in 2006 before the Chinese Government even went to the Kenia and agreed with a agreement where all regulatory treachers, or everyone who would be carried out against the good packaging.
The internal regulation of the concert is that there is no new service, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the next months and years may be strengthened again: while some meaning, Google's books and magazinscan and etc. Archiving project takes the middle measures that the company should be departed shortly with the Supreme Court, so many others are affected through the "Health" system, the establishment of a complete health profile on the hands of resources, and problems.
And the fact that Google built a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - even "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best orwell many in which a man will be scared by the Google data.

Warsawer Börse provides buy offer for Prager Börse
Round 200 million euros, or 5 million Czech Krones offered the warning balls for the hundred percentage buyers of the players.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warschauer Börse, strengthened the offer that the Poland had made at least the fact that they were excluded from the Chechens as possible owners of their bodies.
It is reasonable that the warning bulls are totally the State.
99% of the acts are in the hands of the Poland State, however more than 60% of the papers in the next month.
After the reports of the Czech day period "E15", the victims of the Poland contain the highest price of purchases which have been offered for the prager bodies.

Financial crisis from the view of European journals
In their respective international financial crisis, some European bodies have already spoken on the Sunday by the "Twitter 11 September".
The Global Financial Catastrophe We have given thanks to the President of the United States, even if "La Repubblica" - the President had not been in the situation, his own party for the law design should be taken back to one who should bring something to the interesting situation...
Instead of a "New Pearl Harbor", such as the billion-wreck investors Warren Buffett, it would be more important to talk about a "Twitter 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid organized the sin box also in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the missing political leadership is caused to be the world's economy now at the border of the complaint.
The American Financial System has always been struggling more, and the world will be painful under it.
The Bush Plan wasn't perfect, but now, after the vote in the Congress, the danger that Washington has not prepared a political measure for the crisis management.
The World Economic is in the air, and just at a time, since one of the largest transformations of the history of capitalism.
You can't lay out of the worst, which means "days-visor".
However, some states could still provide their money reserved packages and the banks with the money of the tax accounts before the bankrott.
However, if there are more banks, they will not help more financial prices or other softing measures.
The EU Member States should long-termly spread over their shoes and centralize the controls on the money markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion dollars were paid to low money institutions, remembers the winner "The Standard". Moreover, the journal continues to be realistic that, after the Americans, the European currency numbers had now to take a lot more in their taxes to get out of the crisis.
The EU has not seemed seriously agreed with the crisis, which now runs as a Tsunami on the old continents.
The "Retters" should not immediately "deal" with more than hundred billion euros, but it would be ratified to maintain in what case it would be wise to take the money of the stewards to take a more larger disease.
Intelligent car imits the airport of the humble
What would the best method of developing new technologies for accident disorder if not imitate the independence Sensors from nature?
For example, the branches.
The CEATEC in Japan has been presented a great project in which the Nissan Iningeries of Hummelns were inspired in the creation of new accidents.
In cooperation with the Tokioter University, Nissan built the biomimetic system of type BR23C established by the author boots, a mini-auto, equipped with the properties of the beauty, with the purpose of supporting the development of a system, which disappears every collision.
In the air, each branch represents its own "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection", says Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The combined eye of the bene, which can see in every direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
In order to monitor the function of the collected eights, the researchers took the idea of the laser-management measure.
This identifies restrictions before BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to Board, which immediately enables the coalitional intermediate process.
The hindery is registered in second breakfasts, and the author's officer immediately changes the curses, like the movement of the branches by turning the lines around the appropriate angle.
In addition to previous systems, this manufacturer finds instinctly instinct.
"If it is not so, the author couldn't react quickly to disappear the hinders," said Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the author boot project.
The system must react instinctly and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the most increasing and increasing part of the protection guard - a harm, within the accidents currently continue to be increasing.
The entire process must reflect the manage of the branches when they disappear other bens.
And that's got to be in a brief part of a second.
However, the exhibition, in relation to the branches, not up, bottom, or any diagonal, can only be twodimensional, and only in the direction of the condensability of the rows.
While the branches have recently been opened for many opportunities to remove other branches, the researchers in the manufacturer could serve only the movement, the relationship with the smoking and the breakfast.
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batterys that are easier and energy efficiency, and therefore have a longer life length than the original lithium ionen battery.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less than the ability to save them.
This device must be processed only in seconds and react according to them.
It is not necessary to save these, or manufacture an intuitive, logical reaction, so that it only takes a handful KB Memory at the moment.
No Gigabyte and Megabyte-sharing memories needs.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate coalition technology, which will be seriously in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technologies in the GPS satellite navigation, with aware of the car car rentals and leading it to such a goal.
A name for the synthesizer child
Now, the written version of the 700-Mrd dollars is a serious safeguard package that will be used in several steps, and is declined to purchase the bad credits of the banks.
In the first past, the half of the money shall be exposed.
In a meeting on the Sunday after the north of the East Coast, the Congress agreed after a multi-day debate to an union over 700 billion dollars, reported reuters.
"We have achieved significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American Deputy House, and he said that you should only bring the unity to a paper.
The compromised compromise on the saving package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Financial Ministry Henry Paulson said to the result: The program will show effect and it will be effective, but it must be done more. According to Pelosi, it wasn't going here for the saving of Wall Street, but for the reason to explore the economy ruder.
The letter set of the package was yet published before the opening of the Asian market, so, Washington's time Suntadding 8 hours (middle European Time Monday 2:00 tomorrow), but there is no highlight airport on the board.
First on Monday, the House on the Law Design on Stabilisation of the Economic of 2008, then the Senat is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke on the Samstage with Pelosi, and the white house also welcomed the news about the unity.
We are satisfied with the progress of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, the white house speaker.
The programme, however, is important from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, where 700 billion dollars should be published once for the purchase, with credits charged values.
In the first train, the half of the 700 billion payments shall be exposed at the same time after the convention is expected on the case at the month. This sum shall be used for the credit loader, bad values, and over the more than 100 billion billion USD, the President shall decide.
The programme is checked by a own Commission that also addresses the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion is declined by a further decision of the Congress.
In the meaning of the law, the Financial Ministry can also apply a combined taktic: it can buy the same time bad credits, hypothecs, and buy the value papers loaded with hypothecs, or other "gifty" credits.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can also be successful in an auction as well as directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in a secure programme in which the Financial Ministry guarantees the interesting costs, and the companies pay the payments that are expected to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The Law defines the needed measures so that until 700 billion dollars can be available as a rapid assistance for the American financial system, whether it is a largely largely established purchase, their security, or the reduction of a system risk, which will be solved by the collection of a larger money institution.
We set the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, Paulson.
However, the chiefs of the difficulties and now stated banks can be considered that their departments that are called "Golden Handshake" in the oversee Slang Salop, are covered by the Government.
A cutting of the staff will only be given in certain cases, and these cuttings will be depended on how the financial minister will help.
The currency means that if the Ministry buys in the framework of an auction, the "gold handshake" is designed, although the expenditure of the banksheff will be put into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the false credit, the Government will be aggressive to ensure that the managers will not be transmitted.
The image also includes that the existing gold handhake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions are only on new agreements to share more people in the program.
This is the first case in the history of Americans that managers are regulated by law, the Democratic Barney Frank, President of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State wins the rights of participation to the participating banks, as the risk for the tax numbers, as they can also participate as soon as it is economic and that the saved bank is better.
The Law Design suggests that the President should submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how the employees should return their loss of money from the financial sector.
However, there were two sides of sceptics who had expressed their doubts in relation to the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan protects the money of the stewards, as the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were made by the same persons who are also responsible for the Wall Street colleague.

The Congress and representatives of the Government have announced Marathon on the Sunday tomorrow that they have come to a unit on the bank management package.

Preview of the German speaking space
The right layer is inacted, only the choices were inside the board self-conscious - so comments "The Spigel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to govern a red black coalition.
The speed (splay.de)
In the online output of the left, German mail magazine, France Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic reduction of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution forsakes their fathers."
According to the renomed policyologists, the CSU's erosion began long before the low beckstein-huber-Duo has taken its emergency.
The Christian society have renewed Bayers over decades - now the modern citizens are just turned away from them.
The epoch break is a problem of Christen democracy, as well as for Angela Markel.
The Deaster of the CSU was not surprised, but on the Sunday, something happened to the end, however, before exactly ten years: the increasing heavy heavy healing of a State party
For 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU lands at 47,7 per cent and first fell from the fifty years under the fifty percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 agreement elections, so it was still in the many citated officers.
The consequent moderation of the CSU in the Bundesland has lost their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists have already prognosed that before 40 years, but at the time they were very precious, but without effect, the sakularisation, the education results, the accession of East and North Germany in the prospering regions of Bayerns could not remain in the faith of the CSU Wailers.
Modernation is increasingly steadfast, and this has political consequences.
The right layer is inacted - only the choices inside the boat were critical and personal.
Absolutely, in the last week, the classic citizens groups have exceeded the largest distance to the CSU: the free employment, the civilian citizens and choices with abuses as high school clusters.
This is the support of the CSU at about 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Wiener day period reports in her "Who with who? Parts retained in Coalition Questions" articles about the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OVP is forbidden to the integration of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all directions of conversation while the Green Works are not still trying to establish coalition.
The new choices are completed, and now everything turns around the coalition; in the debates in the public legal TV, the parties have no longer watched in their cards.
SPÖ-head Werner Faymann strengthened his desire to negotiate with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation with both parties is very well possible - in some Member States and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question, whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molters, which the current OPP cap, as Viceanist, has opened Faymann.
As he said, the choicers would have chosen the shoe-meeting course.
It doesn't matter a repeat of this direction.
More of them have been carefully responsible for red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann trys to be inside the OPP.
If its party is in opposition, or in coalition, it is now completely open, and these questions should be discussed in the APP internal.
BZÖ-head Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red black, we are ready to take government responsibility," says Haider.
Jaroka: The devil cross of the poverty and the segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris of the European Gipfels started to equality of opportunity, which is established by the EU Council President of France.
In their discussion on the plenary talk, Lívia Yaroka, the European Population Party Fidesh Assembly, particularly the educational organization, since this is one of the most gravity of laws that reaches Rome-Kinders, and this is the greatest limit for their implementation.
The higher conference was opened by the French employment and social Ministry Xavier Bertrand in the name of the French Council President, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Chance Equality.
Under the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European law protection and citizens organizations in the area of opportunity.
According to the Press Office of the EP-Agents of Fidesz, Jaroka noted that near discrimination at the job search, the Roman would be declined in the first line because of its lower education level from the work market.
"The overwhelming majority of the Roman youths has no medical school education, and thanks to a bad education can only get a small part of them a high school conclusion."
In addition, Jaroka stated that education was a fundamental human right to achieve a key role in the effort of other human rights.
Investments in the early training of Roman Kinders may strengthen the EU Member States' economy.
According to the delegates, it is important that these relations will be considered the most widely wide - so Rome and non-Rome -.
For the first time a Roman student starts the school to increase its opportunities to become a productive member of the work market, and by the income and employment, they contribute to national expenditure.
"In the Union citizens, Rome must be saved the right to high quality education - the bad and segregated teaching must be established." - so Livia Jaroka.
As the Secretary-General declared, a common, target and operational procedure of the European Union is necessary to declare the degree process on education sector, which is the correct maintenance of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break the devil cross of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and to give Rome's democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-forgiving citizens," asked Yaroka.
Since the Congress in Berlin in the past year, the gipfel will be established a yearly with the objective to create a single forum for the promotion of the objectives of equality and discrimination freedom on European, but also national level, in the meaning of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: Grace at time
The end of October will be decided on the shiproom of the falling Duos Huber Beckstein
Instead of the choice box, there are no heads, at the top of the Bayer CSU, the personal debates were broken.
The party of Erwin Huber and President Beckstein remains in their wives, the question is only how long this grace is.
In the last weekend of October, the 17 per cent of voting losses will be decided on the outstanding party.
But this very locked Duo has already been looking for that it doesn't want to put it on their sessions.
They want to take the worried fraction and the party base, which requested a day after the "Bayeric Tsunami" loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago - added, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiver at his carrier height - the Christian Social Union has reached 60,7 per cent. However, now, a year after the putch against staff, they could only ensure only 43,4 per cent of the votes.
The CSU was 46 years ago "Allein-regitor" in Bayern, which produced 18 per cent of the German BIP.
However, the conservatives remain the continuous strength of the importance of South Contracting countries for the Ungarian Economic, but in future coalition will be to be governed.
As the first sign of the party-internal restructuring, the potential follow-up of Hubers, Vice-President and Minister of Agency Horst Seehofer will also be attached to the exploitation team, which is related to the free FDP, in relation to the legal "Free Wahler" Sounding negotiations on a possible munchner coalition.
One Ironie of the ship sale is like that with the list "Free Wahler" that Gabrielle Pauli enters into the law, which an anti-Stailer has first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to maintain the target political gnadency.
The CSU ruling now concentrates all its powers on the stabilisation of Becksteins.
In this transition process, the officer who has gone out of the ground will achieve a active role, and the former President and CSU President called on 28 September the "the latest day of his political aircraft".
On Monday, Huber made a few gravity comments in the direction of CDU - his view would have increased support by the sister party.
Other CSU policies interpreted the delay as a signal to the CDU and that also in Angela Markel.
If the CSU, 2005, has also succeeded much to the national level, will not be replaced with a common force act on the feet, marks will not be able to be cancer again after the agreement's elections in September 2009.
Market, which has not made a held from their deceivement on Fiasko, believes that the CSU losses are not negatively affected by the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is related: the unresolved CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of social democracies will continue.
With 18,6 per cent, the SPD has obtained its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukasenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, there is no representative of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
The Russian Observatory says that this is the goodness and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD, however, condemns lawfulness in the statement of votes.
The OECD sent from 43 countries 450 overseers did not recognize the choices.
The Law Law of 10 millions of resident countries, however, has not been oppositioned for decades, but the membership of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) has been assembled in a serious expectation that Lukashenko, who, with the unreasonable choices, has already renewed the President's request for the fourth time, would have been renewed by the opposition in the Parliament.
That is why the ODS has also taken from the previous planned boykote distance.
Ukraine has also taken credits for the reduction of the price of price increased by the gas import of Russia, and the country has also attached the destruction of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gaspipeline of the country leading through the country. So, under the expectations of the opposition, Ukraine is the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lucas and other higher political policy since an anti-democratic political system.
The Evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the consideration was more positive, instead of the currency, as well as the exclusion of a third part of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the rapid report of the OECD had already criticized the campaign - then the oppositions should not be in the pressure - and in particular the fact that the opposition of the votes should not be attempted.
However, the opposition can be considered a improvement in the political system: the political prisoners have been also set on free feet, and Minsk is even prepared to smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it continues to recognize the undependence of the absolute Georgian Provinces of South-Ocean and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukrainian forms a Federative State, which both areas have been independent since a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backward, but the most important is that the dialogue has started between the White Russia and the EU," said Alexander Milinkewitch to our flat.
In view of the Opposition Canadians of the President's elections of 2006, it is a desire to continue, although the powerful fear has received, it is only a oppositional in Parliament.
The opposition plans no protest measures in respect of the results, but trys more to explain the need of a economic reform to the elections.
"We have been here to fight with many problems - the optical magazines need to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way when they release stone, but I still see that more people support the walls, even the olders," said Milinkewitch, in view of that the most supported weakness of the pensionists with the Lukasenko regime, which is the only service of the production of social security.
"Thanks the decrease of the country and the growth of the trade deficit is only a question of time until it begins to breathe in the silence of a peacehearted "social security", so Milinkewitch.
In accordance with the opposition policy, Russian supervisors have marked the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Community Undependent States, explained the report agent Ria Novosti: "The people believe the facts, and not the words." The missing of the opposition is therefore a evidence for the rife of the White Russian Wagner.
Brunetta: "Ab now will be sent before the work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rounding doors for the incoming and outcome of the offices.
Since today, the measures against those slaughters will be in force that only abstempt and then go to coffee drink during the labour time.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz" has been presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Management and Mauro Masi, Secretary of the President of the Ministry.
">"Treatable doors are a means to increase work efficiency by a higher presence cost and more services", so Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new threat of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the implementation in all the buildings of the Ministerial Council.
Masi means: "The choice of rotating doors is also of a great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from the officers, the Secretary-General confirmed: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all pages."
All in all now there is no morning time during the work time; conclusions with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas says that with a song: "A good cappuccino works wonderful about 7 hours."
During a meeting of the Government Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publiclica Administration)
of Rome states that in three months, the Ministry has reduced the deficiency of the employees to 50%, which means 60,000 people per year in the work.
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public management of Italy
"their loyal dynamics - if the Ministry - were doubled in the last 8-10 years as large as the privacy area and long over the inflation ratio."
Thus, thousands of employees have been collected to interpret the Brunetta Decrete in the framework of the vocational supported by Codacons.
"When the Ministry for the public service is profiled with numbers of smaller accusations in the work - so the consumer center - increases the people of the future faculties.
In fact, thousands of rights and valuable employees of the public service have been gathered together to explain the legal standards of the Decree's war."
In particular, before the Regional Management Court (TAR) for additional financial comparisons for work conditional diseases, the planned extension of the obligatory household of the employees, while the control investigation can be made and further aspects of the ministry's renewment.
Napolitano: "Forwarding to work cases is decisive"
Every day, in Italy, 2500 work cases, three people die and 27 remain unexpectedly.
For 2007, the data of the Inal (National Institute against infortuni sui work) confirm that the killed work cases are at about 1200.
These figures refer to the seriousness of a phenomenon, which almost doubles so many death cases caused as a murder.
Today, the Anmil (Association National Mutilati e Invalii del Lavoro) will take the 58th national day for the victims of work cases to address the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The interesters, extended data and tragic messages from Ammil, confirm the question of the prevention on the workplace.", confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Association National mutilati and invalidi del job) Peter Mercandelli.
The State team expresses its "great assessment for the constant commitment to prevention on workplaces, protection of lost workers, assistance for the victim's families and the sensibilisation of the public opinion."
"An emphasis "Basta" has increased up; of course, in tragedies, measured in their size arrangements, some movies in the media and participation of publicity, but the reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamic."
Napolitano does not advertise that "it is also a resource problem: it must be determined in education and information."
It is particularly important for many initiatives for a direct evaluation in school frameworks since the young people who are raising the work environment.
It is our obligation to justify the attention to this phenomenon and not to decline from his social seriousness. You must set up and improve a judicial standard.
Since the President of the room Gianfranco Fini said, "How the phenomen of the work conditions of death is an urgent social accident, which encourages the knowledge of all of us and all institutions to achieve to work on certain rules that have the goal to put the problem to the end."
"The data of the employment cases seem to be a easy improvement, but it does not conclude that the number of employees are too high," said the President of Anmil, Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want that this "positive tendency" means less attention. That's why the tragedy is at the end."
"We believe that you're undertaking too little to deal with the phenomenomen of accidents, and you can fight with different actions.
More controls and inspections are necessary for our opinion – so Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to declare workers already in school."
"A further effort is necessary - so he adds - what is the communication and the sensibilisation of the public opinion.
But in particular, a greater responsibility feels of the employer's sides against a phenomenon that represents a social accident."
Mercandelli also came to talk to the "progressive corruption of the protection of the victim of the employment" and declared the "production of the social system that we fight in the past years."
"The objective is, therefore, to restore a guarantee to the employer to ensure that the shipment of the victim of a employment case will not be depended on free or random feeds that will be decided for time by a lawyer."
Mp3 Player under attachment: Heavy danger
Sound music about a longer time scan with tragic music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent audiences.
This reports to the European Commission, which in a report in Brussels, the opinion of Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and shortly identified health risks) of the EU.
"On the report, it is also mentioned in a note, it is clear that 5-10% of those who listen at least five years longer than one hour on the day with tragic music devices to risk the perpetual loss of their hearing."
"I'm concerned that a so great number of young people who usually tragic music devices and phones make a lot of volume to make their ears without knowing it," so Meglena Kuneva.
"For scientists, it's the name of the Eu, a clear risk that takes too quick trade.
The fact is to sensibilisate the consumers and to make these information to community.
We need to check the existing control systems in view of these scientists to be fully efficient and to maintain the new technologies' steps."
Brussels, the independent scientific committee had proposed the broad use of tragic music devices under young people.
"The scientists - so ensures the communication of the EU - that you are very concerned and that the Commission will now investigate the necessary measures to protect children and young people before the dream that comes from travelable music devices and similar equipment."
There is now a European standard that limits the level of the dream of tragable music devices to 100 dB, and the concerns of the diseases that could come from one of the very big loads.
These disasters can be very limited in which you can achieve solutions like the reduction of the volume and the length of the exploitation.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union shows that if the users of trainable music devices only listen the week (lower than 89 Dezibel), they have already passed through the legal limits that are applied to the maximum range of the workshop.
Those who exceed these limits risk the complete loss of the audience within five years.
This is therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices, which can be estimated between 2,5 and 10 million people in you.
Roman, Germany provides the "Commission for the future of the main city"
We started today, in March to be completed, in June will go to Bilanz.
This is the chapter set out for the works of the "Commission for the future of the Master City". The Commission has seen this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Theme.
In six months, the President Marzano and the 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
When the project is completed, the town and the Community Council will assess the analysis and projects to be in June, in order to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official Stem" of the capital and the Governing Board Gianni Germanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Germany. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, which will remain political responsibility for the city and the Community Council.
There is no re-distribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large Rome project.
In March, its task will be finished, and the Commission will be resolved again because this project must have a specific end point for time.
In June, the Governing Board reports that, in June, we will present the strategic plan where we will use the work made by the Commission."
The Commission's competence in question, since their opinion is denied to the competence, the German states: "All of the work which the Commission will lead to, and from the quality of its proposals.
If she, as in France, gives the Attali Commission, quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome of the case – then its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is too often employed with the almost problems and accidents that are from time to time.
We want to have a longer time in view to work so in a deep perspective seriously on Rome's development and the future of the city."
The officer of the citizens Roms provides a lot of value to predict: "This Commission is no useless arrangement or a warning: she is absolutely free, she will not cost the Roman citizens, and she will bring us to think, and she will buy the best heads of the heads of the capital."
According to Germany, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is not hermetical or statistical to make our city a quality-- which she really needs, and so to make a common step in the future."
A future, if the supervisor of Romans, which "not only be limited to the current community borders, but is much further looking," not only on the role of Rome as metropol and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A known American politician who has a lot of consideration independently wrote: "Brack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who was dezimited by his decisions, the Economic of the United States, and who had committed relations with the commanding Islam (and this is still a private man today)."
The attacks against Obama will always be heavy, just now where the choices are near.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web page: "This person is full of ambitiations.
Obama is very fresh: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black governors and five black senators."
However, these attacks do not have much to say; it is about rassistic attacks and they do not answer the question of the electoral: he will be a good president, and then there are also the questions; all says that Obama will win with a great proposal.
In this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A magazine from Mississippi, in the deepest southern of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the choice cabin, we will well know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here is a mentality of the United States for the presence that has been hidden until late.
"Speak what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crowds or for Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll get out of America.
Something that you never heard before – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In all cases, although all of these surveys, the final weapons for demokrates are George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error has Bush occurred during his office time? 89% responsed: the war in Iraq.
America's changed.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back to home with a step in the backs.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their life and the Americans were not required to pack.
However, Iraq remains for the majority of the weak point of Bush.
The one who takes his position is in the presence of a serious task.
United States. Financial collection also leaves his speech to journalists: in the journals you can hear the curses, and many accuses the Internet, the "morder" of the print pressure.
Fifty hundred American journalists have been asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental controls.
Today, all journalists are nearly pessimistic what their future comes.
However, they explained that the information about the competents were not really concerned because of the general credibility.
They don't feel so alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
Moreover, the major problems have been made by the newsroom, so the room where the edits work to collect the magazine.
It is a problem that must be resolved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to stop that the traditional journalism, as the great public understands him, does not significantly distort.
A clearer, but complicated pessimism is fulfilled today the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and Executive Senators of Printing Press are the view that the journalism is on national levels in the wrong way.
In the local area, there are even 65 % of the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web goes.
The main flash groups are compared to the way to the Internet, which is considered by many than the "Killer" of the print pressure.
The "economic pressure" that feels journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have given a new technology to conclude, in the hope "they brings something good for the journalism."
The biggest risk is in the American journalism today between the Chefredacakers of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the Chefredakteure at national levels are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while it is only 23% on local level.
Some think it's going to do with the "security in the work".
The operators who are afraid to lose their work within three years have 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The theme of the "safe work" in the team (in our "Redakteure", Anm. Red.) is always a current subject in the United States.
Only 13% of the journalists work under the Treaty.
In a large nation, as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals, journals, radio and TV messengers and Internet drivers, the workers offer as they love, and so it will be a question of take or leave it.
The chefredactures are very often high, and the editor can achieve only 10000 euros per month, and the rent and security rents.
As regards the property, the case will be complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, and so many after the third, to finally reach a certain number of years of 15 percentage.
But the American journalists will be, as they admit themselves, often "beat".
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IM ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEBT IN GROTTAFERRATE
The Chairman of the Second Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the immobiliator, which was requested to be released from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is identified against Copola because of bankrot in the framework of the investigation on the Joint Agreement in the case of the transfer of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release was turned into a retained obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella requested to allow the immobilier to be released from the city of the Province in a room in the main city.
According to the Court, he could give the opportunity to influence his society and to achieve his claiming evidence material.
Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the deputy room against the 700 billion dollar spark package of the white house was a large part of the Americans and is more interested in combating Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the severe exhibition of New York Times, which reports about how the crisis in the running step the Republic Party, which is still more in its old and moderate East Coast-American, which contributes to the State institutions and business community, and the neoconservatives, which are in Washington and the Financial Agriculture, and e.g. in the South and the Centre of the United States.
This part of the Partie thanks to his upstairs, etc., the voice that I mentioned above.
This example is only a small part of the large changes that are announced to the current economic grounds, or even already present: not only in the United States, even in the entire west, and may also be affected by these.
Even in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to conclude the long-term events that are finally accepted and come to light.
The first of these phenomenons is the new detection that the non-allocated Renaissance of the State is linked to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a disagreement of banks and financial institutions that have an internal connection to the foreign and also managed an intimate amount of privacy holdings that live in a single country.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: as it is to be applied to the concerned families, which also show a great choice.
Therefore, the crisis appears economically, political tolerance is almost pure national.
The political internationalism seems to be disappeared and have lost the right of speaking: the enlightening evidence for this is given by the EU, which, because of its duplication in various national and international conflicts, does not know a common way to find.
Therefore, all of them are considered with the income of its own State; salvation plans, new rules, etc. Distribution of help funds: Since the crisis has always been seriously serious, the United States are only to save themselves in economic situation without external aid.
In addition to the measures, they also have the legalization to use this: thus two non-valuable conditions – in certain circumstances – which, in other ways, no international organization or no market can be taken back in similar ways.
The new pressure, which is placed on the national element, is, in the rest, in perfect conformity with the most important meaning that the most recently in the economy is connected to a most recently involved sector: the territoriality.
The paradoxer way is now, when we were so convinced of it, longer to be entered into an unnetted universe, in a kingdom of always different technologies, the immaterial that we need to identify, how our future will always be dependent on the essential material things: water, erect and oil.
However, all of these can be transported from one place to others of the world, but they are also connected to a part of the surscribed part of the earth – a territory.
It is therefore the one who is available over such territory, against another who lives in a disasterless, unleavened area or free of olive conventions.
I'm coming to the second news, however, for a short income.
Whoever territory, whose Government, whoever says the political, says that also Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergent phenomenones.
On the other hand, the knowledge about the need of leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate the things.
On the other hand, there is now a weight of the disarmament on existing leaders, such as the economy, which have cut off as insufficient and full shadow zones.
Finally, there comes a deeper richer and in certain senses: a loss of confidence, an immorality, an image of unbelievableness, a feeling of the remote, which is a whole class of managers of the west countries.
It seems that the convincement in the largest parts of the population seems to adjust the way that it is not only the works of the social Elite, but already their ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the most wise meaning of the word, being their maintenance of most people as always foreign and overwhelming.
The question of Leadership is therefore underlined, but the powerful movement of the launching class and the future political statements. This is shown in unpreviewed "Revolts" of the electoral and in the unlimited construction of the collective support of the last time: beginning with the increase of the Conservatives in Austria and Bayers, on the assembly of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, to the Rebellion of the American Abords against Bush (withly, you also play the rights in Italy in a role).
They win the impression, as the old Elite, their parts, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual faithers, some would say their format, always more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value about what today's date in the bottom social shoes of the West and from the financial crisis is still increased and is raised to overdimensionality.
In view of all of these, it would be difficult to talk about a "rebellion of the mass".
But the eyes are not sure to keep open, but it isn't sure.
The super roller that moves up to walls
The powers of the gravity thanks to a smoke and can higher walls like Superman.
This is the presence of four American research centres, of which one now seems to be at least at the goal.
With one carbon on a board of only 2,5 qcm, the researcher is able to set a 100 kg hard body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO has an American magazine, the results of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a wide development of the tablets already used, which use a special cool structure, called cool substance nanorecords.
"The principle of the Klebers can imagine you as a number to a Stapel Spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have inspired themselves from the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopics, which give the animal a perfect hole.
The tests carried out with various materials such as Glas Teflon and bedpaper have shown that the new celler is ten times stronger than the stop capacity of the feet of the reptilies and also "not issued from the wall", so Liming Dai, researcher of the factory for the engineering sciences of Dayton University.
AN MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material may be used as a transitional raw substance", adds Liming Dai.
Anyway, however, however, the researchers think about a less fascinating use, as well as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanoreasters are also leaders of warm and electricity.
Other application areas may fall in the field of space.
So the superhelds have to wait for the moment.
THE ART OF THE FORSCHUNG – also the University of Berkeley, California, is a new model.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the California scientists presented a microphasis chemistry to purify their heads by movement on a surface itself from the steel, and thus keeps a perfect capture.
Medicines: Never take fruits
Pressure of grapefruits, oranges and apfects.
These threats, which are consumed in the summer because of their refrigerated quality and their vitaminality, may be considered severe health diseases if they are also included with certain life-wide medicines, as they can affect the capture of these bodys in extreme ways.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly repacked on the risk, as well as fresh fruits in connection with medicines. In the framework of 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia renewed warning: It is sufficient to reduce the ability of certain living medicines as long as they are properly elimine and so the health of the patients will be fulfilled.
The grapefruit was already under consideration to be responsible for the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, heartwarming medicine, anxiolytic and neurological means to increase to the toxic level.
MEDICAMENT IN GEFAHR – The same medicine agent had warned in a report of doctors and patients two years ago before the risks of this mixe, and urged to observe what is in connection with medicines such as diazepan or metadons.
ESIST NUMBER GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts also contains orange rate and apfelsaft substances that can cut the medicinal products.
The list of mysterious efficient substances of the fruits are long.
Thus, the call of Michele Carruba, the Director of the University of State di Milano: "The same results will normally be submitted to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change the information of the consumer.
It is therefore recommended to read the package income, and if there is yet unclarednesss, there is no doubt to ask a phothecar or doctor," the expert of the Ansa Agent.
Economic Nobel Price is in Paul Krugman
The Economic Nobel Price is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the development of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a newkeyneian teacher in Princeton University and known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most criticisms of the economic and external policy of the Bush Administration.
A few months after the proposals of 11 September 2001, during the day of the Enron Accommodation, Krugman had said in a New York Times leadership that this second event was more significant for the history of the United States than the attentate.
A proposal, which has not received a little polymic as a response and has been maintained to the economy even years later, but today it is totally correct.
"I am surprised and also crashed about how fast the memories of the Scandales in the context of Enron or Worldcom's collection have been disappeared from the public view field," says Krugman end 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "Economic of great value", but also a banalissor with a "except aggressive style that is particularly guidding against the excessive Liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears to be the third version of the anti-Microsoft packages
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software will win as free cost replacement for Microsofts Office a larger number of users, both homes and offices, as well as free publishers and in public management.
After a year intensive work by the free developer, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now present with some news to the public: next to a transformed and now stealing starting menu, now, is now a reason for ensuring compatibility with Apps OS X, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, so the new standard ISO version is given.
Eight against the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, which can be read by OpenOffice by reading new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting also are some new features, as well as those who allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, such as the sending via email. This also counts the possibility of import PDF files in graphical editor modules and also maintain the original image of the page.
So you can also generate "hybride" PDF files that expand the typical graph of Adobe format to expand the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved items of applications: Tables can now be modified more dependently from various users, however conflicts will be reduced in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor will allow a fraction to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just to publish various OpenOffice functions on the Internet (on the cloud) while the final results should be published in the next weeks.
The Italian version is on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version that seems free from the mirrors.
Except for Windows and Mac OS is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to home or to the office.
In which the freedom of costs can be an advantage for the distribution of the programme in private household, it is also in the field of the business where OpenOffice may be able to attach the great roof: finally various public management and schools have already been passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not avoided on a training offer, which means a optimal assistance for small and medium undertakings and also opens business views.
OpenOffice is joined from five main parts: Writer, the Word matching text; Calc, the table program that makes an excel distortion; Impress, to create presentations such as with Powerpoint; Dbase to explore databases on the location of the known access; and last Draw, a graphical module.
The target for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easy to increase at 3 million and 600 thousand now.
Moreover, the cool is positive and that the fourth doping case
It opens a new doping case in the past tour de France: it is about the Australian Sportler Bernhard Cohl of the Team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classified and trikos driver of the best Kletter.
The message published the journal L'Equipe on their website.
The 26-year-year-old cool of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, the positive on Cera, the epo of the third generation. This was already found to the Italian Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood tests are those who were confirmed last weeks by Losanna and Chatenay Malabry.
In order to ensure the experiences now the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded for two years.
The chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and reported according to the Associated Press also the Austrian competents.
The 26-year-old Austrian went behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also recommended the Trikot of the best kleter for themselves.
ITALIANS SUBSTISTICAL TO THE NEW YORK TO THE FRAGT: WHAT ITALIANS SUBSTISTICAN?
Italia, "the only country of the emigrants has become recently one of the previous countries for immigrants," which will be adopted only with resistance.
Do this from Belpae a nation of rassists? This questions the New York Times in a long article that has been cut off the whole theme of the Rassismus in Italy and from the case of the younger, from Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Mailand after he had made a packing kiss.
The case shows what the Times is called "Paradox of the North": the north regions are those in which "the most integration and work opportunities" are, and "the highest grade of anti-immigration feelings and the greatest support of the North Lega".
As a confirmation of the growing spending between Italian and investors, the times are called on further episodes of the intolerance from Millennium, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Legism against the introduction and the faster indication of the illegal inhumans will also be introduced as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also the Papst and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano requested the Papst at a meeting on the Kirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to fight the racism."
Students of the victims of up to 900 euros per room high merchance prices
The market for rooms for students does not know the crisis.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the Mediterranean industry, a single room can cost a student to 900 euros in Mailand, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already accepted very severe skins. All of students lose their right to study their right, since their families are not able to support them in this height" – so the responsible for Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities brings the great demand from students to the deformation of the market, which also the other inhabitants.
Moreover, most of the payment offers include a number of expenditures: free contracts, missing registers, without price limits, unautorised companies.
The need for the Sunia is to be required by extraordinary measures which lead to a reform of the administration of lower prices.
In explicitly consideration of the investigation, it appears that in Mailand a bedroom is required in the quarter Brianza ca. 450 euros; a single room begins at 650 euros (in fourth band Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the fourth Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or about 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, an average room is 350/400 Euro, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate the university in the fourth rooms, 250/280 euros are for a bedroom of nodes, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters for the Union are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double room.
Only few deep are the positions in the quarters around the other Universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostense and Cinecity.
Only one in the foreign room can save money: 300 euros for a bedplace and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, centocles and similar quotas.
In Neapel, 300-450 euros are required for a bedplace, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the worst quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a 250-350 euro bedroom, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, the prices are lower, but they have a larger weight in the city's economy.
In the cities where the phenomenomen of the migration of external European students are often more than in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a measure that is about 25 to 30% of the average will be required by external students.
By advice to the old Kino Paradiso, the cities close their historical kinosale
The historical kinos closed because of the favorite multiplexkinos.
"A city without kinosal is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the Register Giuseppe Tornator describes with effect what happens now in the large city center of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the extent of the Kinos, which begins with the born of the great multisale complex in the periphery, means the death for the insaalkino in the center. A process that appears not only inevitable and inevitable, but also the cuts of a cultural crime.
Most of historical places are full of memories, "It's like a friend to lose a piece of trace of full emotions", so the registrator of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought Oscar to Oscar 20 years ago and the great price of Cannes. It's like to lose the story of a pre-stadtkinos and his nostalgia, which is in the way to live in a well lost kinolet forever.
The numbers that give the Anec, the central fertilization, speak a clear language: in the past five years, the immediate quantity of 316 traditional kinos must be closed; these strings paid to the largest part of the kinos in the largest cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Miland, Neapel, Bologna and Rom, 6 in Turin and 5 in Pallermo.
The most important areas are the Emilia Romangna with 82 lost kinos, followed by the Toscana with 44 and the Lombardei with 41.
This shows that the major offences are multiplexkinos, because only these three regions are recorded in the largest number of these modern kinos: with 195 the Lombardei brings the lists, 81 are also in Toscana and Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," so Paul Protti, President of Anec, "and it is useful to make new structures, but in the first place, the achievement of the existing, because the room is closed in the city, not all its stages are ready to look for an old multiplexkino in the periphery.
And there remains still the missing state for the fund of the Eight of the Court: the load of crime signed by the State is about about 10 million euros.
It is a threat of the ethical moral position that the government does not observe the existing laws.
To get the sector, it would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of Note."
Interesting is the case of Bolóna, the first Italian city, which decided to protect them through a agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this type in Italy, which means to protect and support traditional kinos, as well as in the historical center, as well as in the periphery.
In the preliminary measures, there are also strong provisions for the kino operators and the benefits for the public on the neighbour transport: it will be allowed to go to the fields of transporting in the Centre and also parking more parks.
"It's a happy initiative," so Giuseppe Tornator, "I hope that other cities will be attached to our example and also design new concepts.
However, we also need a better audio and video equipment to justify something against the super power of multiplexals, because the public is finally more vulnerable today.
The Protection of the traditional kinos was a very important theme for me: the closement of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and younger, was the extreme point that brought me to greet the "Novo cinema paradiso" even if I had played 10 years ago with the thought.
Since 25 years I live in Rome; when I go over at Rialto or Kirinale in the Via Nacional, there where I have so many different emotions, I'm turned to the side, so I don't need to see the low-detected plaquets.
The connections between the political and the Ndrangheta are leading to arrest the citizen leader of Gioia Tauro
"The citizen master of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group Piromalli.
The accusations of the administration of the Antimafia Authority of Kalabrian against the citizens of Giorgio Dal Torrione and his representative Rosario Schiavone of the community of Gioia Tauro, which have been arrested tomorrow in Mafia businesses.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an older adviser between the Clan and the public administration, and its nephew: the lawyer whose same name is the same name as the boss of the Clan was already judged by developing in criminal units of Mafia, once to a destruction of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard," the lawyers wrote, "if the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advice."
"It was possible to make the Mafia Group, so the judges, in official ways to enter the Council's households and to apply the public management policy."
The Chairman of the Regional Committee of Calabrien Agazio Loiero does not reject that in his region it is "all other than a exception to steal connections of local administrations and organizated crimes." "There are places where the concentration of Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically incompatible.
But there are also local policies that resist the pressure of the Ndrangheta: Helds who get a white wedding.
The prisons of this morning followed those from the past July, with which the police of Clan Piromalli was held.
Since the end of the last April, the Community Council of Gioia Tauro was released, however, since 1991 – and at the same time, on the basis of the connections between organizated crimes and the local management, the local politicians of their community.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a citizen master of Udc, has been chosen by May 2006 to the head of the Middle Coalition.
He cried Skandal as the prefector ordered the solution of the Common Council.
He was interested in the Vice-ministry Marco Minniti, which he applied to find everything from political strategic reasons, but the judges explained in relation to the challenge command of this morning that the Piromalli Clan would even request an amendment of the A3 project.
From an absorption in relation to the investigations in the case of Dal Torrione, it has shown that the wishes of a companier, which is known as a representative of the great group about Piromalli – as the actions of the public management were identical to the interests of this Clans."
When the energy goes out of the woods, the biggests will run
It is a non-profit source that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet, and now it seems to understand the large energy firms of the world.
Feeds, streams and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking for all now and looking for occuping, such as gigants like Chevron.
The opportunity to win the energy from the movements of the sea is already in consideration and investigation since 70 years; these studies have not efficiently intensified since the first earthquake crisis.
When the price of the oil in 1980 was cut off the ideas of the sea energy, but now the environmental organizations and the higher oil price are covered on new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the worldwide energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the oceans.
This is equal to the duplicate of the energy produced currently through atomic works.
Moreover, the trainings and times are also coming.
Gigants at attack.
The first company, which is now setting on the sea energy, is Enersis, which signed in 2005 a Treaty on the establishment of a force work in North Portugal.
When this message was published, it appeared to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more companies from the traditional energy branch that are attached to the sea energy winning.
"Chevron researchs these technologys" – if the speaker of a known company of the American Gigants in Wall Street Journal – and has the opportunity to cooperate with us."
This is about to maintain a permit from the American Energy Commission, which is required to start a project before the East Alaska.
This is not an extraordinary sign, for example, if you consider that at Alaska continues to promote oil through the United States, and President Bush has launched the plans for new challenges.
Besides Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which is investing in the new branch; also the details are not known, but the supervisor speaks of a higher interest.
Another improvement technology.
Experts talk about one of the technology still in the breakdown, which is not last because the last doubts of the environmental protection sides are not clear.
The projects such as in Portugal and the Scotland are increasingly smaller and seem to not seriously cause ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large level, technologies are needed with greater impact on the environment.
There are various opportunities: Ocean Power uses a system of connected bojens.
The skin of the wealth that moves and moves the bowns will be converted within the swallows on colbs and cylinders into hydraulical pressure.
This includes a turbine that reacts to a generator.
The stream will be sent on subwater leading to the coast.
There are four planned annexes of this type who are still waiting for the State Acceptation. One part of the winning energy may also serve for military institutions.
Condent Power produces the energy for a vessel and a parlet with subsee tourbines in East River of New York.
The water movements during the time are attached to tourbines which are eaten by the existing movement of the generator.
According to Verdent, there is already a long scan of possible clients to the required authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the weights, then the times.
A special interest is worthy of the Institute for Structure Research Research Institute, in view of the potential that is in time.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are more preceding than wind streams, sunscreening, and thus a confidential source.
In addition, the time energy is that the contracts such as New York, Maine, and Alaska and other cost countries have already invested $7,5 million in 2008 – for 2009 have already been planned to 35 million.
