Munken 1856: Four cards that change your view to the city
A disaster in which young people should be agreed today.
A bunch box where the S-Bhann tunnel is now built.
Small gardens maintain the unique reason of buildings.
The oldest official map of Munchens promotes springing stories in days.
It's nervous if landcards are not currently.
It knows everybody who had to get up once because the Auto-Navi showed a green way instead of a circuit street.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlantis, an offer of the geoportal Bayers of the Government, are all other than the current - but so is so very close.
Especially if you compare them with the current online cards.
Then, how cities and communities have changed from the 19th century since the Monachine Merkur's divorce area.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flow-up that you don't recognize as such.
In the large supervisory maps, there were more detailed maps for cities and communities, such as urpositives.
These detailed according to the data of the Bayerian Meeting Management between 1810 and 1864 and declined from the first payment of Bayerns.
Your tasker: Napoleon.
The French soldier was included by Bayern since 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted a survey of the invested country and gave a topographic capture of Bayerns in the task - of course to military purposes.
Even when the French forces with the peace of Luneville of 9 February 181 were finally disappeared: the neighborhoods, which created the idea of a flooding Bayer card.
Curfur Max IV. Joseph continued to proceed the project, based on the "Topographic Office" and that the Bayerical Meeting Management.
The Urpose Board for Munich is from 1856 and is to find as all others on the Web site of the Bayerian country library.
The comparison of the previous/today is, for example, the country's capital city is at the end.
The city has spread out in all directions and has grown together.
A example of the sub-sendment that is still related to isolation in the map of 1856.
Sending was 21 years after the card, so 1877, as a munchner part of the city.
Today, the submission is in the middle of the city.
The householders are concentrated on 1856 after the current Plingan street named to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the raising of bayer buildings against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing as fields - on the first view: A smaller card appears with thousands of lines and numbers: manually numbered aircrafts from the same "upload", which was released from the basic steel.
Small parcelles are there today no farmers more - but small gardens of the "Land in the Sun".
A large area is drawn north from submission.
The Theresian Week, since 1810, was the spectrum of the October Fest, in fact, in the 19th century, was still a wheel - and no beton desert.
On the other side of Isar, historical cards have a view to the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpose Tablet, you read not only the name of the streets "am Gasteg" or from the highest "of the leafs" but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yeah, here on the airfield street, one of the ones locked up with weapons.
There was 1858/59 the Mounchner Creis's Irrenist "Our Lüfts".
Since 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment - this psychiater, which is brought in relation to the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for instance, ended the accusation of the same mistakes.
Furthermore, he has understood the person to use violence against the insects," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the museum of Haïause, who has been employed for an explanation with the Anstalt.
For 280 patients, there was first place, later was expanded on 500 places.
Sometimes this capacity is not exceeded anymore - the reason for the construction of the cross-reneast in 1905.
There is from 2006 the Issar-Amper Clinic Mounchen-Est, one of the largest psychiatrics of Germany.
In the area of the old ornament, youths are now in the Mounchner Salesianum.
The order took the building complex in 1920 and walked in a young house with training operations.
Westly, the football place of the TSV Munchen East, east residents from the 1980s.
2015 the child's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in an architectonic design on the original building of Irene Anstalt, who was destroyed in the Second World War at bomb attacks.
The sea place was signed in 1856 as "Haft Place", which was called "Accorting Gas".
A decisive change has also brought the second World War in the heart of the municipality.
The bombs of the Allied are risked in December 1944.
A big stay until today - in the Marine Hoff.
The English Institute, small business houses, and a grouping chamber from the centeralter was once in Marinhof, where these days were prepared and on 5 April 2017, the Spatenstich for the second S-bahn stamfast tracks.
With the slider, the old munchen card can be compared with the air picture of today - and fulfill the loch on the Marinhouse.
The Civil Rights Group publishes the travel warning for Missouri
The National Agreement for the Promotion of Colours has made a warning for colored people who have been moved to the discriminatory policy and the rassistic attacks of the State to Missouri.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Office of Missouri, which will be held in force until 28 August 2017, requests Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouriers to take special attention through the State and to make outside attention, as a number of fraud-based, racial cases in the last time, and are noted here in the opinion of the group.
A recently agreed law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win discrimination clusters, as well as the crime persecution authorities of the State, which are unrelatedly to minorities, have been rejected by the Group to exceed the revoking warning, said the NAACP.
"They have losses of the citizens' rights that cause people to pass.
They will be stopped because of their hair color, they will be struck or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Red Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We listen to wars in such difficulties that we have not yet heard."
It is the first warning that the organization has made for a State in the United States.
The group quoted cases like rassistic processes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under demanding circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no benzine over the country and was taken from Missouri's police in a warranty without a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report of Missouri's office of the General Agency of Missouri, which is shown that the black carriers in the State will be maintained in 75% often more than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employers about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people have to be ready to bring the cooking money or to let the friends know that they are going through the State."
Missouri signed in 2015 100 Hass crimes after the new numbers of the FBI Hass Criminal Report Programme, which included the State in relation to the number of such disasters at the 16th range of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri scheme that would make it difficult to report a company because of residence or employment discrimination.
First, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had decided to ensure the local persecution authorities to arrest people because of refugees, which will be contributed to further race profiling according to the ACLU.
Travel warnings are usually carried out by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Wedding projects are elements
The fisherbacher project Weidezaun is a success project and is continued in the next year.
Peter White and Cordula Kovac's CDU Budgets have made a picture before.
In the right tombhouse of the family of Swedenmann, the representative of the Fishbacher CDU location was joined with the citizens leader Thomas Schneider and the two deputy.
Markus Swedenmann first offered a view in his operation where he maintained 55 hectares and 40 hectares Wald, 40 milks and also many young animals and maintained in five rooms.
The "Birdwald Milch" is for him the alternative non-market route for the milk of his hair, such as the Swedish man.
On the table of the fertilizers, except regionals.
Since he is also the BLHV president of fisherbach, he marked the wedding project as "elements important".
I can't steal on the areas that I can't win economies.
The Green Area cares for a lot of work, many needs to be edited with the engine.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Swedenman.
2003 he took the old operation and conducted this without chemical planning protection and darkness, even if he does not carry out a bio-operation.
For the citizens Master Thomas Schneider was clear: "The community has recognised the meaning of the wedding project and is happy about the leader's contribution."
For the costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the agricultures should be supported.
You hope that the research of the areas could be cut out for a whole time.
"The greatest love we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to carry their operation," said the citizens.
The agricultors are often in the crisis because of the promoting of the agriculture.
In 2013, 25 parts of 11 participants were totally united in 2013.
The opening area includes 40 hectares that cannot be replaced at least 2023.
From the total costs of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a fourth part of the community of fisherbach.
Thus, the agricultors of 12 610 euros have to be invested in 16,2 miles of wedding saun.
"The great property is the length of the deep," said the Swedish man.
Kordula Kovac said, "You do a good job, without landscapes and farmers."
Peter White also stated: "This is the best food produced."
The landscape line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the State Promotion of Weides.
The objective is the opening of the Black Wald.
For instance, the existence is one of the phrases referred to by the LPR.
Furthermore, the incoming area should not be able to be able to be able to be lowered (increasing more than 35%), and it must be delayed by the investigation.
For the fisherbaker project 2018 Weidezaun project, the request of eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build 16 kilometer Zaun.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares calculated costs for over 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more holy?
Now, the white house of Trump is the freedom state
The most safe sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the states.
The Americans assess the same as each other - therefore the worried insensitive shop Saddam Husseins on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideas of the Trump Regimes, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a close war with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastical limit of the legal introduction with freedom.
To stay honest, Miller doesn't touch the state itself.
A horde of boots behaviors and Liberty Immiters would have fixed him if he had done it.
But he took their meaning, and especially the meaning that she was referred to as the famous story of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the end of the idea was added to his base.
As Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to go here to a complete story, but the freedom state is... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The story to which you have been added later and not part of the original freedom state."
Miller is actually right, but as he himself formed it, it doesn't really mean his story.
It is about the time Genesis resonance on the exciting words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state enters not only any old investors, but the worst of the poor: "Your weaknesses, your army, / your weak massages, which will see afterwards, be free, / the desert of your rich continents."
There's never been a time when the "increasing accident" was better to see our screens.
Miller didn't engage in literary crisis - he clearly made that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.
This conflict is part of a larger political and cultural cooperation because of the meaning of a state: it is actually a conflict for the importance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they had been fulfilled a high-politic action.
Sculpture should show the connections between the French and the American Republicanism by showing them in a classic image show of the freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her mind, the famous figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives himself a whole other name: the mother of the Exilans.
The connection of the medicine with the image is a brilliant feministic coup and an arrogant attack on the American Nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the state, people wanted to change this from the right floor for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the freedom state has no one, but more than a former neoconservative who brings the American floor into the surrounded world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
She will take the failure of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The fake will not light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh is locked here on something.
The meaning of the state is a question of the position of the approval.
The great fantastic fact of Lazarus showed them to see how they were created, losing, but hopeful people after long and often were seen terrible travels on the decks of ships.
It is the most serious sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people, looking for the fight and a chance to improve their life.
Their states tell them the words of hope and welcome that they should hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective that the Millers and Trumps always want to recognize.
Their fax shall not light the way, but the hate that is their only source of power.
World Mastership 2017: Neil Black lobs Skottic members of the British Team
Elila Doyle remembers a time when only two scotches were listed to the British team
The lead director of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-head shootical contingent in the World Meeting Box will "a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scozia athletes was selected for London 2017, which started on free.
Black believes that "I have developed something special in Scotland" and the latethletics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I'm talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they have done.
The Scope Athletes think that there's something to do with what they did.
British Lightactletic: It has something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy in the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant."
More of the Scottian Athletes are Medaillen advantages, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - that will be attached to Sir Mo Farah on 5000 m streets, while Eilida Doyle was chosen from the manship to the team captain.
"Eilid is very decisive.
Your Captain's conversation was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, unless they were scootical, or whereever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very honourable and were very motivated.
The suffering and the real feeling, the Eilida, of course, was great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medaille Winner, which will be attached to its fifth world officers at the 400-m cities, says that it's "unlawful" that 16 shops are in the British Management.
Scotland's best number of athletes in the world community was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Mediterranean Lighting Muir leads on this way and has established five British and two European records in the past year.
She will be shared at 1.500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, running 1,500 m, is another shoot that you should watch after a great saison that contained the trials in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first world-wide communities when the only other shots in the Team Lee McConnell.
The Management Captain says that they are "except honour" on the fact that many of their country leaders are not only to the team but also in some cases with the medicals and the finals.
"The speciality of the team's captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor, but to know that my team colleagues have voted for me and have chosen me, it makes it something very special for me," added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the shoes that are to the team.
It just shows how far we came.
And they're here as an appointed athletes, athletes who want to go up on the grounds.
What's my talk like Captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just have shown that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home-universe.
So it is really important to set up this home support and to benefit from that we are again in the Olympiastadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and competite, and it will just be a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't be sure of a public office if you can't handle the office of choices
The father of our country knew something of bad pressure.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the journals struck him throughout all, from the internal policy to its political principles.
He struck at the critic, sure.
But he didn't bring his critics to swallow.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be taken, and we will be led as the sheep to the slaughter."
This brings me to the Governor Larry Hogan to be more like Washington.
Hogan's cooperators have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook site.
And the American Civil Liberties Union struck him on the beginning of this week.
The stab of the Governor removed the ship as free, and the online comment was full of a reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic State, which is increasingly loved.
He has the second maximum agreement of the 50 governments of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf.
He has shown a fixed hand in guidance of his State and strict maintenance of principles.
He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his choices and to play his free head to chemotherapie on his side.
Therefore, the locking of persons who come on the side of the Governor - which is a public forum which is officially identified and of the workers who are paid with public officers - in needless and finally dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defends the actions of the Governor and argumented that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or smokes or hazardous people who smoke the peits online.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a employer, and a guarantee, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respective, thoughtless and not profane.
The Pharager quoted the Bible in his post and called Hogans Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not fulfilled, but she asked Hass crime.
"I was highly commented that I was deceived that there was no reaction on fascinating crimes and other current messages," she wrote in the comment area of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea, even if a number of people take the same subject, they will be missed from some more than a such collective use and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the officers of the Governor were called "the concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "First speaker".
The Facebook eura is easy to cut a message by just blocking a critical or to remove a negative comment.
It is much more serious than in the past time when you had done the same that the workers were sent to collect and burn reports with critical guidelines, or to arrest the demonstrators, and to bring to suffer.
But exactly that happens just digital.
Hogan is not the first public office that will be criticized for that he has made Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is described by Twitter users that were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milk stone in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The President of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County lost the first amendment, according to the US-Bezirk Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she broke a choice from her Facebook site.
And in Kentucky, the Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the weird portos had a similar effect like the Internet.
The number of magazines varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck on their leadership.
And even that time, Washington had anonymous Trolle.
People who used the pseudonymes such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" write all letters in magazines that describe the decisions of Washington.
Petitions who criticized his position on the contract of Amity, the trade and the shipship with the United Kingdom, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Paper of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring her to smooth.
Talk freedom, opinion differences and discussions are based on our nation.
And true leadership means to accept it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be an holiday comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be expected in the next three days at home comfort, since the Renaissance Club in East Lotian is established 25.
The Northire, who carried up in Archerfield Links to the end before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new expenditure place and worked as Turnier newspapers in the name of the United States and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he got his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he's in a good state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He's a vacuum robbery of this game and is honourable on his loss here.
This is a great buyer for this course."
The English Eales is glad to defend a teaching first time, although he won in his 32-year-year carriers as well as in the European Tour, as well as in the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels particularly," he said to the secret games in Southport.
"I couldn't defense the Extremadura Open since she was wined in the year after I win her from the program.
It's magic to come back to this part of the world.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
Remindations from the last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and a time we will always be appreciated."
Gary Orr, who came back to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year, returned to the action on homebodies.
This event will be its first scotch progress since the Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It means always a little bit more if you play home," said Or, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really got it to play again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy about how much it's done."
With the Trio on the field are the former Masters Seeger Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the old Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are the six shoots on the field, others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The income is free, the parking place costs $5 per car with a insect and $10 per car with two or more insects.

Length of lenscrebs by passive requests
In the past two decades, less people have been dead for passive reviews.
To this result, scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study.
"After our assessments are returned to 167 long-term cases to passive requests," said the student Heiko Becher.
As compared, he brought a own study to this subject of 1994.
At that time, it has been given 400 low-speed cases for passivity per year in Germany.
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House keys are considered as very complex
Building works in the villager streets are in full way and "they are sometimes in the time", so the leader of the Builder Fred Heinze.
In the field of household clauses, the situation is more complicated than contemporary, because it is a lot of hiding that is not in the plans.
The transport that retains the building works, makes a great problem for the construction of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the car cars before red amples and abrupts is already great," Heinze reported.
The street is locked and only the line buses are authorised to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp are busy for weeks.
"The names of the days were very beautiful.
But fortunately, we were offered by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei buys the evening, she doesn't use herds.
She's even using just a stick.
In its woodhouse in Enarotali, the main city of the Panai Government in the unruched Indonesian Province Papua, the housewife usually sets a sugar cartoffel - local as "nota" - directly in the cabin.
After a half hour, the blowed knole will be cut off and disappointed hands.
Degei sits on the board - she has no mobble - where she also carried her daily work, for example, clothes with dry water from the near suffice.
A egg in an unclean room serves as latrine.
As the latest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to her fields.
Polygamy is usually here.
Of course, it may be dangerous to work later: most cities are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody expects to go out to the town after 17.00," she says.
It is an extraordinary impression in the day life in Papua Highland, an older Netherlands Columbia, which was adopted in 1969 after a restricted referendum in Indonesia, as only 1.026 elders should be fulfilled by a public trade training.
An existing movement, which has rejected the independentness of the Netherlands government, has turned quickly against the Government of Jakarta, which is the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or laws monitors of it.
In 2003, the provincies were officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua Newguinea included the east part of the island.
Enarotali is as far away as it's food. The travel contains a 90-minute airport from the city of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-minute car with the car.
There is no public transport equipment.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants belongs to wood houses that are around by Bambuseen, and from well-blocks that have been converted by roses in various yellow-brane sounds.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, since journalists and practically no strangers.
Before Christian missionarys arrived, Mae Pago Papuuns was a God named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not worthy to take this garment," says Degei, and shows their lives, handmaid Turban, you dark heed and their brilliant rock.
"Therefore we had only breaths on our body."
Papua is the worst province indonesian where 28% of people live under poverty limits and some of the worst children's death and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian Goldland.
The largest and professional goldmine of the world, Grasberg, in the possession of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport built 3,1 billion dollars Gold and Buy.
Furthermore, Papua is available on wood resources in the value of 78 billion dollars estimated.
However, these rich men are a source of the ransom for the Papua, which ensures that the powerful military Indians maintains a vast presence.
An investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars, including 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuunical requirements after greater autonomie are cutting these gold gas and be treated freely.
After the data of activity, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands of the Indonesian soldiers were forced, held and arrested since 1969.
Measures in Papua Stammeshochland in the 1970s, according to the Commission of Human Rights to the people's murder.
Only in the region, Indonesian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrants in the past year.
"We lose everything" says in a report of the Erzdiose Brisbane from 2016, in the report on Greece states of the previous year, such as unreasonable facilities and volunteers - administration and electricity are particularly affected after another report - and the brutal reduction of peace demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because every week events happen," says Andreas Harson, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screams have increased because the Papua resources have caused a distortion of sidlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3,5 million inhabitants of the Province is to 83% Christian, but the demographic development has changed because Muslim economic migrants come from the Population Islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesic Warning Cantinas sold honey and Gado-Gado, serves a missed birds with a terrain sauce.
Local people fight to keep here.
"The migrants have started to sell branches and smokes on the traditional market more than the local Papua," said Abeth You, a 24-year-year Pania-Einheimer who went to work in Jayapura.
"It's the inhabitants Papua - the Mom Mom [wives] chose from Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in the population of Jokowi, promised to fulfil the inequalities and jurisdictions in Papua during his election campaign 2014.
The former roomman ensures 27 of the total 29 of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the President Palast in Jakarta.
But in Papua has changed a little bit, and today the inhabitants feel injured.
"Our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jokowi 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that righteousness will be restored," says you.
In fact, Paniai is only two months after Jokois investment in October a depth point.
On 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and blowing birds before a storage fire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers were carried out by the darkness.
The worried children told them that they should enable their shooters.
One of the soldiers took up their sound and returned later with four soldiers, if the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drinked, shoot and shoot the group with their weapons, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers burned in the group of children.
A child, the 16-yeimo Yulianus Yeimo, was so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the construction of the nearby government committee was set in Brand and the things scanned next day.
At least 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered together on a football place before the local policeist and the military Command Centre to request justice.
They brought zeremonial jagdboxs and led the Waita tanz - in the cycle running and a birdge steam - from Papua Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to smoke stones on police and military posts.
When the vote was held, the soldiers were sent to the soldiers a command on an internal function: "When the mass are leaving more than three times, they will be killed," says it in a official document of TIME which was not released to the local media.
Jeremiah Kame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto Vittels of Enarotali, saw the worst danger and cried to rest, and requested the quantities to return home.
Nobody was to listen to the vote.
"If I turned around, I was immediately cut into my left handheld," he said TIME on the veranda of his bottom wood house.
Kakame still doesn't know who burned, but he says that the bullets came from the rows of the soldiers collected here.
"It was overflowed, many shoes were burned," he added.
The inheim man Alfius Youw was found three times, so his cousin, the witness of the exhibitions.
"I tried to him and investigated his body to go sure that he was," said Yohanes, who had just a name, the TIME in the dark vote.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The officer of Papua-Polizei, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to save their station only because they were attacked.
"We need to protect us if people are going to kill us," said the speaker of Papua-Polizei, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrants were killed and many more hurts.
The news about the murders came to Jakarta on the next day 'filtered'.
Three weeks in Jayapura Jokowi had a painful conversation in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extraordinary mechanism to contribute historical human rights.
But the explanations started immediately.
"The most disagreements have been made for a long time.
Some were in the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed us to achieve these losses, but there are processes that must be passed through," he said.
Then, Viranto made a return when he talked with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set in Papua a concurrent mechanism.
Instead, "We are all legally regulated," he said.
Whiranto, which the UNO has addressed "criminality against humanity" which requested more than 1,000 death victims in Ostimor's blood independence agreement in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights crimes were already contributed to Papua, including the Pania's prevention.
The family of the Paniai victims have taken such consciences with grievous incredibility.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," said Yohanes.
"I'm late."
He says he still lives in fear for years later.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid to be challenged."
His brother Yacobus repeatedly viewed that people in Pania are afraid to discuss the case.
He says he was struck by the soldier after he was helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I entered the body, the soldier seeked me," he said.
The shoes haven't stopped.
On Sunday, the Indian police fell on towns in Panias Neighbourhood Deyai.
While a confrontation between citizens and the manager of a builder, who refused to bring a unconscious man into the hospital, a person died and 17 others, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Dou, who was drinking when he fished in a nearest river, died on the way to the hospital.
The citizens were protested before the office of the company.
The police said that the citizens stoned stones on officers who reacted on it by shopping warnings.
But Inheimic says that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the quantities and kill a murder.
"We were so in Panik, we were afraid that it would be ransom," says the 29-year Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital, and was a witness as the last ones had been introduced quickly, so the TIME.
"I hid me two days in my house."
The Deyai Parlament has called to take the participated officials to account and to remove the mobile brigade of the police from the area.
Paniai was always an inheritance for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of essential development increases the incompatibility of the tribes, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the Green Highland of Papua.
Many were closed by the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which means to protect the rights of Papua, by attaching sporadical attacks and executions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a reaction on this, thousands of people in Panai were arrested in the past years, and will be taken into prison, under the presence of "security of the National Sovereignty".
Some don't touch again.
Besides the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragedy, forgotten place".
The poverty strengthens the unfortunateness.
The little road that is sold in Enarotali is too poor for inheimic.
The bread is exactly excluded.
People here build everything they eat: in particular note and upper and white-ups.
Agriculture is the task of women that can edit four or five fields of the smooth cart.
They keep the largest part of the achievement for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Note only 10,000 indonesian rupees (75 cents).
During the time, economic inequalities have grown between inhabitants Papua and the new migrants, which have been achieved since the opening of new aircrafts to the Nabire airport.
The few workplaces in the region are regularly to the best designed and welcomed migrants.
Papua has noticed the capital or the necessary capacity to lead their own enterprises to competition.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there is no job or money," says John Gobai, the President of the Stamme Council of Pania.
Isolation takes the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, the restrictions of the reporting of international media are considered.
In the beginning of the year, the French journalists Frank Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of the missing coordination with associated institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to films.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asian director of Human Rights Watch, the Jokois election fight was not implemented to promote transparency and development limits.
"There is new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia the eastest provincies of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refusation and a black list," he said in a statement.
The missing press control means that the international pressure to the Indonesian Government remains increasingly limited to the direct neighborhoods of Papua.
In March six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshal Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine the "different and widely extended losses" in Papua, including the Pania Squire.
These countries have seen historically the OPM support.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir, as well as the properties of the group, said, "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to transmit evidence for human rights."
The people want to know that more foreign governments are known.
As a official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the Human Rights Board Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited the fourth May, inheims took their shields and threatened him "We want freedom", according to a source that was also participated at the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another election in 2019, but Papua says that they may not be voted again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has a good view, but he is raised by people who are participated in the Pania's shoes," says Gobai, the President of the Station Council.
He wants to know that Jokowi knows that the Pania-Volk, describes that it lives under the permanent distress of a ruber military, is in poor health services.
Gobai says that the Pania leaders, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "schold" that he needs to pay back.
"They don't need money, they only want justice," he said.
Instead of the drugs and surprises, the family of the Pania's shooting victims caused a last symbolic act of suffering: the body of a victim was buried exactly against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with sad head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire covers the 'Toch' cloudscretcher of Dubai on the second time
A fire found on the free day in one of the highest habitats of the world in Dubai his dry book and twelve hundreds of inhabitants from 337 meters to fly 79 steel buildings.
It is the second burn that runs through the house only two years, which will be called the Torch Tower (fackel tour).
The building was evacuated, losses were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flamme.
"We have sleeped and we are awakened in the fire warning and when the people cried.
We ran down the trap down, and it was about 10 minutes to come from the 50th age," said a resident who gave his name as George Reuters.
Dubais Civil Protection Authorities said that the units of burning fighting against 4.00 hours (00:00 GMT) remove the fire and feel the building.
The Government said that it works for the preparation of undertakings for the concerns.
The case can continue to live questions on the safety of materials used in the outside areas of high schools in the world.
An investigation through the management of the torch-building after its burning in 2015 found that the largest part of the wounds of the dress, the external decoration of decoration or isolation came.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of platts to isolation and dress at the London Grenfell Turm in June could have contributed to the rare extension of a brand to die at about 80 people.
No Davis-Cup Reform: Next-of-five
The President of the International Tennisband (ITF) has been fulfilled with his great Davis Coup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play Davis-Cup units only on two victories, not supporting the required two-third majority.
These are sometimes very long, but it is also why very appreciated five-set-class, so the traditional competition is reached.
63.54 per cent of the Member States was applied to the reform that the objective of the ITF President David Haggerty was just deceived.
"We respect this decision, but we are deceived that our memberships have not accepted the whole reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of this icon and historical competition," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve competition.
It was not only a vote after many agreements before the proposal came to bring the final to a neutral place.
News from 2018 are just smaller details: So the financialists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right in the next year in the first road.
In order to reduce the costs for the events, the requirements in training places, etc. will be improved and the players will be solved before the Davis Cup's Cup less official media terms.
More than 1 of 5 U.S. travellers bring for prohibited conditions to the aircraft, finds a question
A review under aeroplanes has concluded that more than 20 per cent of awareness or unconsciously prohibited circumstances on the control points of the US Transport Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, while they were carried out of properly prohibited measuring or other circumstances with clones.
Less than 1 per cent, they would have pronounced that they were irregularly equipped with shoes, munition or shoes.
The question of more than 1,000 people - which were carried out by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that young people have missed the rules.
From the questions that admitted that they were attempted to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of thousands were compared with less than 15 per cent, the members of the X generation.
The most often referred to in TSA agents were food and fleet.
More than 3 per cent of the scientist concerns have been carried out by the security control, while 2,2 per cent of the residual demands and 3,7 per cent of the men's questions were confirmed that they had been carried out in the aircraft.
The company said that it had been asked to find rivers throughout the country to find how much amazing smuggler had brought through the airport safety and how many had done it.
There is no surprise that the people who are in the old room - scientist or unbelievable - through the safety they were the most often flying.
However, the company indicates that the TSA guidelines are something complicated and complicated.
People are often insufficient, which flights they can take or how many of them are.
Therefore, it is not surprised that the largest quantity of aircraft prohibited by the TSA.
A long time people thought that the TSA could see books as a smokeware.
Flights are allowed to be inland flying, but not on international flows.
Elon Musk is nothing: Ten thousand Tesla boys storing orders
Electro-tausendsassa Elon Musk is pleased with the big number of pre-previews for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has submitted that one of the customers has already returned their unconnected reserve.
Besides the constant triumphate numbers of interactions and even gigant paragraphs targets Tesla-head Elon Musk, in the recognition of the latest quarter bilance, first a number of other, less green: which smoking in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequency in the past months with more than 500,000 adjustments for the new car, which has now started.
Now rooms the Musk: From the total 518,000 previews, 63,000 have already been returned.
Criticals have always revealed that it is only in connection reserves.
In a taxation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment".
Currently, 455,000 of these unconnected reserves have been able to explore music in a phone conference with analysis.
The Tesla's head does not believe that the cutting of about 12 percent of all orders could be the problem, however, the Tesla head does not believe.
His argument: The requirement for honourable growth objectives is not in the demand, but on the production page.
The last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 - all models must be collected - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The question is obviously there.
According to the Musk, 1800 reserves are present.
Today, a "Model 3" may be considered in the second year half 2018 with the delivery - if Tesla is able to make its neighbors, never go out in the practice of production streets without greater disruptions with maximum exhaustion.
Many experts doubt that it is possible.
However, it is to be greater disasters, then the incompatibility of the reservations may be to the problem of Tesla.
For then, the company can't delay unfortunate customers to take care of it.
EPA-head Pruitt returns from the Hynauzers of the rules of Obama Era to reduce the emissions
One day after he was declared from 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the captain of the environmental protection authority, returned his previous decision to ensure the implementation of the rules of Obama-Era to reduce the emissions Smog responsible for aircraft.
It was presented to the walldel, as its Agency showed the needs of the national environmental authorities in relation to reaction rather than former administrations.
He didn't mention the balance that was raised up against his previous position in a contractual execution court.
It is about a period of time that has been held on 1 October for States to maintain the standards of 2015 for the grounds of Ozon.
In June, he was noted that he would take up a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to prevent the plan to "include in local decisions or economic growth".
Exactly, who was the State Agency of Oklahoma before his name by President Donald Trump, was a long time-limited advantage of stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, it is prompt to continue to block regulations, or to discharge chemical industry, and the industries of fossile products.
The latest jurisdiction for the regulatory rollback agent is the performance of the Mediterranean.
Last month, a contract employment court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has overcome his authority when he tried to ensure the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In an opinion published in the Mediterranean, it concluded that its returns in Ozonstandards would be easy to strengthen the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of the implementation of new standards.
"After previous administrations, the EPA often did not hold the periods of implementation and then expected to be affected by activity groups and others, and in one accord, to set the date for implementation,," said Pruitt, which the EPA raised more than a thousand times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in a regulation through court procedures, and we are serious.
We also take the law and the authority that we have is serious."
However, the opinion of the EPA stated that Pruitt would use its "awareness to protect and all other entire entirely available" to ensure that the provisions "based on a solid policy and the best available information."
Republicans in the Congress are increasing reform of ozone rules.
A legal design approved in the last month shall replace the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years.
The measure has not been voted to vote in the Senate.
The New Yorker General State Agency, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had committed the EPA in this week, said that the group would be intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The turn of the EPA - to our plans - is an important winning for health and security of these 6,7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly involved by the smog who strikes in their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York closed in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Colombia.
The ground-ozone is included when smooth materials from cars, power works, oilafineries, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight.
The existing smog can cause serious attempts in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of previous death accidents each year.
The representatives of the public health and the environmental protector jubeled over the surprising curses.
"It's surrounding how much pressure it needs to be to make this understanding step from the responsibility for the protection of the air that we're incoming," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We need to continue to fight the ideal cross of the Trump Government to offer environmental murders and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years St. Hilarius Church: The Jubilee of the mountain Church will be invited on the old Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 p.m. to a series.
Or his ideal situation and a beautiful view on the city is the history of St. Hilarius's location a favorite location.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade may be disappointed from this powerful location.
The saving and maintenance of the oldest buildings in the place have made friends and friends of Tumlingen to their attitude.
Walter Martini says, "It's a single low little."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Urgent Book: Graf Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the founding pharmaceutical church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Mr. Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The word of the Urgent stated on the Tumling Mount, except the single Pharrier Church, also a rural court to whom the Church or the Pathodox Rights are involved and not turned back.
So people lived there.
As the description of the officer's joy City from 1858, the subdorf and the overdorf, which is now recognised in the area of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" of the third, the rule of the town.
Old cards from the time around the year 1600 are cutting these story circumstances.
The right of the patronate is exceeded from the right of property.
A master who built a church, raised and set up with a pharmaceut, remained the owner of this church and could also destroy this own church.
This was the right to put up a barrier or to propose a new barrier.
There were three altars in the church and two clocks on the tour.
The biggest of the two is broken in the Sundays 1673.
The new-reached Glocks were first 1692, but later in the Second World War in 1942 had to be released.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648), the window locks were locked and the locks were locked.
It wasn't.
1796, French forces were launched near the church.
They broke the cancels and church trees out and used them as burning wood.
The rest of the church was able to cut off 1809.
At 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last challenge for the dead of hearsweiler.
1823 the peacehop was expanded and the Hilarian Church was interrupted.
Only the church storm has been standing.
In the night of New Year, 1834, a storm spread the church storm and half the church shoot.
To prevent a disagreement, the tour was interrupted.
Only the existing Turm Turm War has remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Woem of the "showed Rentners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius's age.
As an artist, the friends and friends of Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, launched the sixth series on the old peacehof at St. Hilariu Kassel.
This will be established by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium City and with words of Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
In the first place, Hartmut Romann says the end word.
The programme starts at 16:30.
Inlass is from 15:30.
Without the Serenade, there is a restraint in place before the peacehof.
"Get a sommer pad under the shadow of old trees and with the low look over shows to the wood," the story shows the fantastic view.
The serenade is only found in the weather.
Ancients hope for many supporters to maintain the history of St. Hilarius St. Hilarius, which is important for tumblings and auditors.
Friends and friends of Tumlingen feel specially obligated to the home office, as the Serenade Organisator Walter Martini enforces.
Anyway, you want to check the authorisation of winddriders
Boisheim does not seem legal for the building and therefore turned back to the Landrat.
The Agreement "Boisheim is turned back" requested Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to recognize its authorisation for the establishment of planted wind forces in the Boisheim web.
You have been successful.
The Agreement argued that at the date of approval on 30 December 2016, there were no wind force facilities in the Boisheimer Net, since there was only a wind-concentration zone on the town border to Swalmtal.
In this concentration area, the concentration area is essentially possible to build and operate wind energy facilities, but the concentration area affects the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the town area.
Such areas must prevent a "disparency" of the landscape.
The city foursen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Net - but it had not accepted the Düsseldorf government, because of a form error.
"Because the missing planning law is the authorised decision to reject as before legally and therefore," said Christoph Knows, the president of Boisheim.
Current position of things: The town Council has decided the wind concentration area in the Boisheimer web before the summer pause, and a acceptance of the civil government is still out.
Consciously, "Damit is planned for a authorisation for the establishment of wind energy arrangements."
The circulation confirms the income of the requirement.
"The corresponding writes have been entered since the past week at the fourth cross," explained a speaker.
The cross takes it to raise the matter again.
However, they do not beyond that the procedure is stopped.
With a view to the executive procedure in the administrative court, the cross on the Sunday would not include the argument of the Treaty 'Boisheim'.
The NEW Re, a daughter company of the NEW, plants the building of four to 200 meters high windways on a ground on the Boisheimer web.
For the past year, the company in which four were in the middle party had closed the payment contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares.
With the creation of the four wind energy energy arrangements, the electricity needs can be covered by about 11 400 households - that corresponds to a fifth of the power requirements of all fourth budgets.
The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.
In the past room, four city rates gave green light for the buying of three windpark Linnich in the windpark Linnich and a participation in a wind energy at Ubach-Palenberg in Kres Heinsberg.
Cars and tractor break together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible travel accident has occurred on free day-fore-day at 10:00 at the L 333 between lowwatermen and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
A woman was murdered.

City and handlers plan "Home Shops" weekend
Bad Langen Salsagers and people from the region should redetecte the possibilities of purchase in the inner town in September.
The officer and the city manager want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to buy the inhabitants to buy bumble in the inner town.
As the President of the Conference, Christian King, announced, the "Heimat-Shop" weekend will sensibilisize the customers for which offers the own city besides the normal supermarket wall.
The plant is therefore a market with regional offers, like the week market.
In addition, home companies should be presented with their training places.
Furthermore, the businesses of the inner town should be invited to "Mitnights Shops".
The action is not only on the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In the preparation of the radio, a Internet video and printed beats shown at the weekend of the action, so Christian King.
The town management and branches cooperate with the industry and trade campaign.
This means that the merchandise and the city go into a further step of the project "Attractive Inner City".
This includes new offers such as the first "activity Day" to the branch feast and the Sunday sold, talking with all the driving and economy to move them to the active participation.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the review on parks at this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be locked again or again.
That is the courses and tourists.
But many inhabitants were also lost the inside town when they sell out the vision.
At the end, everyone needs to contribute to live inside the town - to reduce the operations of the entire city and the United States.
It was able to overcome the Lathargie that had partly broken, with a network, the King had said in the morning.
Birgit Streich, leader of the IHK centers in Mohlhouse, shared the third party of the "Heimat-Shop" day, first five Thuringers cities.
Beside Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Saint City and Bleech Rode.
The day shall "for the evaluation of the local trade and its importance for the community, even though our cities are stronger."
The action under the Federation of the IHK and with many partners also makes clear that each citizen with its self-behavior could affect its direct environment.

Trump set after transsecured tracking scripts of phone calls Mexican under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between President Donald Trump and Leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump in a telephoneate with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the U.S. declared him because he had openly attached the wall, and reports followed him, "You can't tell the price."
Trump started his President campaign with the promise to establish a wall at the southern border of the United States, and it was hard to pay Mexican for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and fulfilled a special exhaustion.
Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States fleeting in Australia to take "fastly", "mies" and "dumm" and that the existence of the trade that the Government of Obama was provided would be made as a "dep" after he had proposed a prohibition of the conversion of flights in the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after Mr. Turnbull said, "This is the most desirable call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists bring rassistic purchat as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of surveys in the country Monroe, Georgia, and rolled on the Ford Breaks of Moore.
Before the car that had four black passions and a white driver that could get the briefs, a group of white men with weapons came out to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a middle age in a nadelstreife ship - took a long train at his cigarette and looked in the wind protection box.
The insects were swallowed in fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" The man cried.
"Take him out of the car!"
The scream screamed the silence when a young black man was broken out of the consecutive.
For happy is this terrible scene that was played on 22 July, just one design.
But when a sling runs around the hair of "roger", all in the public are almost cut out very real smokers.
Since 2005, citizens came back to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night in the two black Paare - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody has been attacked for murder.
"It is really increasing that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our congregations, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the institution.
"It's a smoking flock on a story, but it's a load for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-year-old Congress Assembly of Georgia and a long-term citizens.
He serves as a dramatic call to trade and gives an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an unrighteousness has never been corrected.
"We want to persecution, we want to end, we want salvation, we want forgiveness, but first we must receive justice," he said.
"We can't be healed and reward until we receive righteousness."
A court medicine puts a bedtuch on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford-Lynchens on 27 July 1946.
Following the FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the circumstances of the Lynch process have been disturbed.
But no one has been attacked.
Although the sufferers remain on free feet since decades, citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: Politic and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to put them on the first time in the pre-selected war in the sovereignty.
In the same time, as the choice has been able to achieve the details of the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white basic officer, Barnett Hester, while a fight was low - obviously because of a woman.
Brooks said that the story was in the city that Hester was sleeping with Mrs. Malcoms Dorothy and that the baby that she brought was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white officer, 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI.
He was joined from Dorothy and her coins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they went away from prison and came near Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob turned the car.
"It was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concluded an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there has been a compliment between the State and local crime persecution, which was not only involved in the murderers, and has defend the identity of witnesses."
Brooks forms it still pregnant.
"It was a choice-right mistaker," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you leave registering yourself and if you disappear, this will happen to you."
Having a decade of years, Cassandra Greene led the annual post of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch's murder.
Their imagination is obviously, obvious, and is based on a kind of deep rassism, which many want to believe that he doesn't exist in America anymore.
It's hard to look at, and it's still hard to look out, but Greene said that it's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the linger, because then we'll be confronted with his famousness to all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not to hear what I have done."
The tests for this year's production started in June, and on the first day, at least 30 shooters - a thousand white and the rest of black - in a room and lighting as Green started a well-played over the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Green Co-register here.
He played the role of the Chef Clan member since years, but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel painful because I'm not so," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried to play their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the Chester's crying and threatening him, weird that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, away from my property!"
Rascona removes the fire.
There's a break.
And then every (alway all black shoe players) goes into a slider.
Green was late.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and disappointed.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kicking.
"I just don't think white people's once-- he said."
"But," smoked one of the other black carriers.
"You just have to meet the hard R.."
And exactly the energy is moved in the room, a feeling of the camera society replaces the incompatibility.
Everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the reminder of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it smooth and expressed.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This recovery ends violent and quick.
There's grieves, shoes, and then silence.
A woman, with a threat clothing, is over the body of the shoe player, and brings Billie Holidays severe lover "Strange Fruit".
Their voice is related to each second word.
At least hundred meters behind there was a group of about four thousand observers weight and dress from the eyes.
The public is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, attempt to see the lead, many come down only the streets.
All of you have lived at nearly eight hours in the pressure of Georgia when Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Before this point, the murder remains a acedote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch kills are located, the air feels special.
When the last notes of the song, Green introduces the quantity to come closer and inspection the body.
Children shoot their heads, record the fat blood and the silent body and fleet each other.
"They are not really dead," murmels a little boy as he wants to remember it.
After a few minutes, Green thanks to the quantity - and soon it is complete.
The shooters throw away the ringchwealth and disappear their thresholds.
Bradshaw smokes Marbaugh, the man in the ship that played the Clanmit member.
Nick Rascona smokes two of his partners and then weeping together in their arms, and the emotional lack of the lead ends with him.
"It's okay," flows one of the women.
"We know that it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Afterward, the public is joined with the spectaculars to evening.
On a table, a white couple of Atlanta is attached to the design with a black park that they just have learned.
Denise Duplinski fighted to find words whose feeling has left the introduction.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and facts... from people who look like you yourself and do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really dos with me, let me believe that the ring still goes," she added, "that's only the police shoes."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof is on his table, he is and remembers the citizen rights.
He said he had already started planning the lead in the next year.
"The design is in some way inspiring, because she describes the fear of what we have received, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
He who doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is judged to repeat it."
"God's comfort" the Wagner in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, Frank Castorf also sets up a rub-free inscending before gigantic, six-six-six-six.
The road bowls (organized by Aleksandar Denic) are optionally shown a crazy street ketch and the wall rest and the Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Eleste" logo from DDR sites or the New York bridge.
There is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer in which the ring girls are located as Rockergirls, or alternatively an iset.
Stapled oil feeds remember Castorfs Leitmotive - money, power and gier - that is going through his "Ring" inscending.
The three ring girls - seats of Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkull and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the "Rheingold" wonderful.
Kess delivers Siegfried (Stefan Vinke) in Hollywood Maniers a body in the coffee room and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Miling sings the beautiful fishing hair that turns the Aura of a weight boxers.
Brutal the scene when he's smoking the vigfried.
Afterward, Gunther (Marcus Each) must also believe in it.
The public thanks to the ensemble with strong applaus.
Stormly feeded Foster, Milling, Vinke and Janovski, which are formally replaced and the hands to the market rates.
Great cases are available for the festival, which is first shown on the bown - in view of the big hitze again in small free-time clothing.
With Spanning, Frank Castorf and his Regiteam was expected.
If he had to go over 2013, there were five years later a big jubel in which the "Buh" calls were submitted.
The Festival Chef Katharina Wagner had to be happy about it.
"Man knows that the public has grown in some way," she said shortly before the dpa's introduction.
The public has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also a understanding for its view.
I'm going to be a positive review.
Max Menge works as freewill
They work in their freedom year as well as a number of places.
Where are you all around?
Many: Normally in Steinfurt in the Mobile Board, once in the week I am helping here in Greven in the mobile brakes.
And I've already worked at school open day.
How are your experiences that?
Many: It's a beautiful, wide spektrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, fleeting, young adults.
You're now 26 years, so you're a later calling freedom.
How's that going on?
Meanwhile: I made abus.
And then a construction studio, let's say, successfully interrupted.
I realized that it's wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's a view that you can see how it's before, maybe, in the burning point, it's real.
And was that?
Many: I've collected a lot of instructions.
I'm going to start my study in social wealth in the Winterseester.
I'm going to study double, probably in the young dad Herne a social training and students in Hamm at the school.
Isn't it something incompatible while the freedom service has a number of different employment areas?
Many: Yes, it's very variable.
It's always about where FSJ makes it.
You can make it from the age house to younger work - in all possible social works.
I was very exchanged with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon.
That was exactly the right thing I've made.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Other than in the building studio?
Many: Of course, this isn't going to calculate statistics.
There are still other people who have a entire story behind themselves.
If a flight, if a younger who was cut out from the family, you always need to enter individually on it.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have the driving?
Many: I'm not the guy for that.
It's a area there's a lot of one.
Love, much kindness.
There's sometimes negative moments, but that's the same life.

EPA decides to interrupt the Smog rules for clothes
The U.S. Environmental Authority has decided to interrupt a regulation of the Government of Obama, where the States are committed to enter the Smog-profit emissions, which had been a day after 15 States had declared the Agency in the case of the step.
The EPA recommended the decision to prevent the "Ozone provisions 2015" as later on Middle Pennsylvania, and said that it shows the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we respond to our state partner," said EPA-head Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, the EPA had announced the view of the ozone rules - in which it should be measured in a part of the country's smoking emissions to determine where it should be established in order to maintain a serious air quality standards - to reduce a year to October 2018.
A group of 15 major democratic States, together with Colombia's cerebral, was held on the Sunday Agreement and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to turn back a wide palette of environmental designs that the previous President Barack Obama has established as part of a larger age, which, according to the Trump, should turn back to the economic growth.
However, the efforts have disappeared the democracy and natural protection groups that are concerned about the impacts of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA web site says that the air inmates containing the ozone "reduce the length function and can strengthen the atmosphere symptoms" such as as Asthma.
Communities want Community rooms
At the end, the decision was clearly clearly: In two respective votes, the Communities Council decided to establish a Community room in the future residence of seniors.
Before the discussion, there is a major information: The purchase contract is signed for the remaining missing basic part, reported by the citizens Bernhard Tjaden.
Although there will be a long time until the area of the church assembly is in the community, but now there is no more planning project to vote by a private investors.
There is a discussion on a Community space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has recommended to come to the community.
In the ground, he would set a room - around 55 square meters - and a limited terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The Government and most of the Common Council suggests that such Community rooms are not only for the residents of the old-hour residents but openly enter the community.
For example, the word from "Strickcafe" made the round.
The decision that has been proposed by the preparation of funds for the running budget already have been proposed in the past.
The building is in the sanction area.
The establishment of a Community room, reported by Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal of the Decision sees to sign the investors that you would not want to cut down the bottoms between the feet, the definition that the satellite-- what is involved in the environment - as well as Pultdach - what reduces the flood and makes the building economic - would be possible.
Unnecessary, it doesn't just mean Wilfried Sohmer, be that addiction.
If it helps, he's just going to happen to the gremium.
It's not so simple in the Community room.
Daniela call refers to the many own buildings with which you don't come so right, so you're living now in the community room from the window, she says, "I'm doing it hard."
Yvonne Staiger is unconditional for the Community room, however, absolutely against a community participation.
After this, it sees a covered subvention to uncomfortable or exhaustive investors.
It is not like that, because with the construction of the area, you don't give a committee, but get a real, in the case of the marketing value, it is the reward.
The requiring request to submit the decision's proposal is found for three employees.
So it remains in two original votes in the program that Stefan Haller is taking together: "When we make the decision so, we'll make a step to close a riez in our infrastructure."

FC Bayern Munchen has to resist David Alaba and Thiago at Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup finds without him: David Alaba has to leave the game against Dortmund.
With personal sorts, the FC Bayern goes to the first game of the new saison to Dortmund.
Seven profiles miss the title defense in the Supercup against the pokal.
The personal sorts in German football recorder Bayern Munchen are always greater than the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) in Pokalsier Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also face David Alaba in Duell with the BVB.
It confirmed that the Italians were free.
Moreover, Manuel Newer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and John Bernad.
For the five deadlines in the past six test games, Ancelotti has responsible for the body and the missing balance in the game of his husband.
"We know we are not in the best physical conscience," said Ancelotti and added, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in the first official responsibility game of the saison.

The Partie is sold with 81.360 visitors, the German football Liga (DFL) shared on free day.
Turn in the heart of stars to stars
In the heart, the first "Sterne path" should be in the heart.
This plan is the United States Starwart Sant Andreasberg.
A planet route exists in Godingen - since 2003.
A "Sterne path" comes from the information need of many harvests, says it.
He connects nature, science, movement and sport training.
The members want to create the planned route tables and information about stars and stars.
In a first phase to 2018, the United Nations plans "best available installations to five to six places" in the overharz.
Questions come from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Highness and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be completed by Internet.
That is why a good mobile network receiver plays a role in the local selection.
The freedom is also a criterium.
Afterwards, the street path should be expanded to smoke.
"For the path of the star, the viewer has many knowledge values, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," explained the Agreement.
They also learned why stars had different colours or why a star lights stronger than a other, although he is more remote.
It will also be distributed in which star image is a chosen star and when he is the best to see.
The Treaty has already been involved since 2014 in St. Andreasberg in the town of St. Andreasberg, the most closeest North Germany.
The location in the middle of the National Park Harz is numbered by the data of the Budget for Nature Protection on the six darkest regions in Germany.
Frequently, from the milk streets and even the Andromeda galaxy with only eye is clear.
In the Union City, there is something similar to the planetary planetary of the United States since 2003 - the planet route.
In beginning before Birhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inner part of our sunsystem, the planet route leads its skins up to Hainberg and Star Water - and a "exterior" location in Demarden (Common Equations) with the planet Sedna.
The skins with the single planets - including the degraded planet plant at the end - are exactly established in the distance and measure table of one to two billion.
So the earth smokes on a cup of 6,5 millimeters of smoke, while the exactly 75 meters remote sun is always 70 cents.
The entire distance of the planet route is good for four kilometers.
While the sun light is required for eight hours until Pluto, footballs need a good hour until the star with Pluto.
So footers are faster than the light in the world.
The March to the next Fixster would have been a half-year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet first, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should stand in a collision course to invest the most weird box fight in near the future under 147 £, were first on Sunday.
They were in separate rooms in the ESPN Offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unconstructed World Boxing Council Leight Weight Champion, went down to welcome the World Boxing Organization of Super-First Champion.
Following Garcias Vig by a single decision on the old four-division-wide-leader Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are the top-5 pound-for list of pounds.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I want you a lot of luck."
Lomachenko defends his torch against Miguel Marriaga at the Same Stage at 19 hours at ESPN.
When the couple of photos positioned, Lomachenko-manager Egis Climas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a married wedding," remembered Garcia.
"I am up for Broner [140 £] but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get a lot of weight.
And he has to move on lighter [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko was right.
"Boxs need this fight."
Climas asked whether it should be at Pay-per-View, part of a strategy, which must fight with a lomachenko in this year to join a date with Garcia in the next room (37-0, 30 knockouts), which also has interest in the fight against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after the light weight fight in the Forum on 23 September.
"This fight could be located in Pay-per-view mode because all fans were asked after him," said Garcia and pressed later to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this type of attention.
When they're always ready... "
Garcia said he would appreciate Lomachenko as "a great fighter," and he might be part of his Sunday war.
But Lomachenko was at the great lob for Garcia and said he thought he saw the trick fight champion from Riverside's riverside's very late, I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted the Co-Aus."
Garcia said that the focus was to show the box, then boxes.
They both said that they could feel the motive that was built for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be executed.
No other battle makes so much attention and awareness.
I'm more happy than working there," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've waited for the top fighter, and this is Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Four lasts to the room boarder
In an accident on the A7, four persons were severely hurt on Sunday afternoon.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost 16.30 hours shortly before the market broadcast, probably after a travel boarder controls on his vehicle.
The Pkw smoked to the right in the wound where he was overwhelmed and then stayed on the board in the green street.
The four insects - two adults and two children - were very hard in the accident.
While the first challenge of losts through the saving service, the A7 was locked for a few hours in the north direction, then the transport could be carried out on the left vehicle to the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Driverkette works better."
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to the Saison Attach against Braunschweig that the optimization of the refugee formatting in Aue points.
With the first saison game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, also the result, there would not be the two gegenerators at 2:2 against braunschwing.
"There were two agents too much, and we have to stay in Aue still better," says Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The triangle should also be further optimized.
And a gate after a freestone, the Fortunes are not going to be able to be taken anymore.
"For the future, there will be so that nobody will be near Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his marriage will also be better adjusted after the experiences in the preparation with the triangle sheet than with the fourth sheet.
"Now I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his trainer peacehelm functional, but Hoffmann is sure of his matter, 'cause we're just in the triangle box on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prevention is, but we're still more harmonizing and we're not making so many play errors."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"Of if you can talk about a missing beginning, you don't know.
The loss could be all right," Hoffmann said.
"But if we get four points in the Sunday, and we can concentrate on the pool, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular saison attack."
Thatvon didn't want his trainer to know anything.
"The start in the saison I appreciate only six to eight game days," said peacehelm functionel, which doesn't want to speak of a privilege against Oe, just because the game of the things in Heidenheim should be interrupted forwardly because of an unbelievers.
"Now they can start the saison almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players of Aue may even be something more fresh, because they had no hard and complete game like Fortuna against a high-food in the bones.
"But they don't know so much about 100% where they stand now," says the internal protector of the Fortuna.
In addition, the guests from Rheinland are as easy favorite on Sunday in the event in the final (fast) stadium of Aue.
"When we leave them, only because we have the intention to come under the first six, it's crazy," says Funkel, that the balance is only at a decrease against Oe from nine games is positive.
"No marriage is in the 2th contract which you have to shoot forward," states Fortunas Chefcoach.
"It would be arrogant and exceeding."
And so I don't want his players to live on the Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asyllter evaluation tests are published
The most recent results of the tests of asyl searches in Sweden, which have been submitted a new method for medical evaluation of their age, shows that more than 80 percent of the anointed persons are older than 18 years, but not everyone believes the exactness of these results.
The Sweden Authority for Forensic Medicine (Reat Medicinal Network) has started with the implementation of the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age as well as the Sweden Migration Authority (Migration Requests) is criticized during the assessment of the correct age of some flights that were less years.
Since today, the migration network has been sent to test cases, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of the total 2.481 tests from Middle March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while the Forensic Medicine Agency in more 25 cases evaluated that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "possibly below 18 years."
The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is issued.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are maintained in the past months.
"We see no great difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are very constant," he said The Local.
The highest part of cases in which person was judged over 18 years, does not mean that the asylum competitor lying over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases, "provided that the investigated person was 18 years or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she stated that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she was 18 years old in this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which is made by rational rates of wisdom, and MRT-responses of neighbors, which will then be analysed by cycles and radiologs, has been criticized in some areas.
A sceptic is the endochrinology Claude Marcus of the Carolinska Institute, whose work includes the evaluation of the biological rifes of people to see whether they went early or later than normally through the puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measure should be used.
The biological age to assess this way is very insufficient.
If we can't say that, we should not do that as if we could," he said the Metro magazine.
But Glanson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defends the exactness of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk, a child, as adults, is less.
The biggest risk is in it if the person is low to 18, in this case it is about 10 per cent."
Fill in Plan
The works on the three bridges of the ground street 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well proceeded.
On Middle Wednesday, a severe 7 tons of beton part was installed at the bridges at the east location of lauterbach.
"We are very good in the time, it runs super," says Reinhold easy, building leaders in the division of streets and transport in the Government President Freeburg.
In April, the works started at the same time at all three health presses between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is provided for October, and it is easy to ensure that the time is maintained.
The first bridge from Schramberg leads over the tromb.
She's a bottle bottle fraction from Beton, which is dressed with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the two other briefs, it has come in the middle of the years.
In order to ensure the stability and transport security, the three building works will now be healthy.
The two other bridges are leaving over the board.
You are built out of red Buntsandstein.
Both was created in 1939, and they are 12, relatively 10,60 meters long.
The bridges at the location of Louterbach have now received a breedth of 1,30 meters in the northern morning, and seven tons are severely mentioned.
This is a front-beaching that is also used as a professional route.
At the southern part of the bridge, a broad box of 2,20 meters shall be used on free day.
Then the feet is going to go.
The particular is that it's about the preparation, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already tracted with the patent boxes.
Especially finger-spitch feelings required the guidance by the building in the latterbach.
Because there is also a glass-face box that has been attached to many companys.
The residents were informed about the proposal in the field of work by Handheld.
Furthermore, fish and crumbs were first to be covered.
For the bridges between the building and the collection officer in the direction Schramberg, the transport is regulated by an ample.
For the building works at the bridges in the lauterbacher location, the street in the area of the bridges at the height of the hotels "Tannhof" and "Seven Linden" is locked full.
The costs for the three tickets are together 700 000 euros.
The whole country is financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest in German Cartoffelsalt
It is not so often prevented that the parties go to a street, but if it goes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is only difficult to bring under a hut.
The parties represented in Kreistag Volkanevel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left) are a wide branch that shows peaceful flag this day because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall Rondell to the place of "great choice robbert".
And known names brings up to the beginning - as Alice Weidel, which makes the Spitzenduo to the Federal Head on 24 September, and the Storch-President Beatrice of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the beginning of the occurrence, do not want to listen to the AfD-learning, but demonstrate.
The Motto "The oil remains struck."
Originally, the town picknick was planned under the Motto "All on a table" on the branch place, but now it is found on the parking room below the round - and so directly before the eyes of those who come to the town room.
A bunch of pictures that works there.
And what Christa Karoli, President of the Forums, is a world and one of the weird organizators, is rightly glad, "How many people have been gathered here."
There are music and every lot of food, including a "urdish cartoffelsalet, which can also eat without problem", says the woman who brought him.
The police has organized a lot of employees to Gerolstein, she shows the presence in particular in the boathouse, which is only a few meters away from the processing sorts.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Volkaneafel, he tried to make such an event and received the contribution.
The 45-year-old-year-old dinnersdorf was first asked in Daun, but there was an absence because there was no enough parking place for the laurentic kirmes already built.
Now, the Rondell, Hompes are glad that "We can have a beautiful event here."
By looking at the event on the rounding plan, he says, "This is the good right of people, mainly, it remains peaceful."
This also makes it: At 20 hours, a band of discussions in the town hall, including the Reinland-Facial AfD-Presided Youre Children.
In the room, there are about 200 customers who expect that the Spitze Candidatin for the Treasury election, Alice Wedel, and the stealing contracting President Beatrice of Storch holds their talks.
Unchanged is the policy presence, but the officers had a resting night.
A few more than one hours, the AfD processing, the guests on the board have a longer attempt, but there is also a short time after 21 hours.
The police can disappear - no special advantages.

Coe lobs "real" Russian excuse for Doping Scandal
The world-wide Leightatletic, Sebastian Coe, praised on the Sunday, which he described as a public excuse from Russia to a Doping-Scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport.

In a challenge in the northern Fritzlar, two of the two soldiers in Mali were intended about about 1,000 people.
The Zeremonia was found in the Domstadt on the Sunday.

In addition, Hessen's President Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Secretary-General of the Agreement Working People Weker.
The sufferers put rose down, and the relatives stood arms in arms on the särgens.
Before the church, Fritzlers and many soldiers persecuted Zeremonia on a lending.
The Ministry of Defence of the League refers to the income soldiers as "height decorated" and use procedures.
The stabshopman has built the aircraft operator of the fighter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the six first designed Tiger pilots.
In addition, the Commissioner of the Government of the soldiers explained: "If this assignment could not decline the absurd, there would be no powerful."
The United Nations Mission in Mali did not doubt that the Ministry of the League showed: The use is dangerous.
But he is also highly meaning "for a country from which we are separated only through two countries," she said.
After the fucking fire, the scars were brought out of the Dom.

Prince Henrik doesn't want to grave near his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83) will not be killed after his death near his wife.
This shared the king's house on the Sunday.
Traditionally, the Danish King Party will be used in the Dom Kirche of Ross sources.
The picturehouse Bjørn Nørgaard has already been achieved a Sarkophag for both of them.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, and it continued to report.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be still unclean.
But he did not have the view to be applied in his French house.
Prince Henrik had never made a held out that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 he would like to be king.
2016 he went into the rest and put the title "Prinzmahl".
Since Henrik had not received the title and the function he wanted, he didn't look at his wife as the same - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the leader of the Danish king's house.
Where the last challenge of 83 years will be finally unclean.
Nevertheless, he had not the view to be applied in his French house, but in Denmark.

Theborn Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French Adelslecht, had known Margethe 1965 in London.
In the theme he worked in the French message.
While his latter woman had a serious position in his 50-year government in the Danish.
In an autobiography, Henrik expressed the first years in Denmark: "Which months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swallowed, I prefered wine instead of beer, seed smoking in place of strikes, citros instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the galaxies that I struck in place of Virginia tobacco, and those in this country had the call to be the marks of society critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope on care.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position, and I didn't worry.
They were just two errors!"
Mr President Weil wants fast new elections
CDU and FDP for the possibility of most of the low-shots
The nearby President Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the Red Green Government Movie for a fast new election of the country day, but he does not want to return.
Because it was on the free day for the resolution of the Parliament.
First, the surprising outcome of a Green Agreement from its country-day Fraction in the Netherlands, the Government of the President Stephan Weil (SPD) had in a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red green coalition in Hannover has lost their nice income multiple in Parliament on the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The past Green Advisory Agreement, every Twenty, founded its step with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in their choice cross in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," explained her on freeday in Hannover.
CDU-fraction manager Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to take them.
The CDU and FDP were together 69 sites in the low-sex, SPD and Green Site 68.
The relationship was turned to long.
The new landday will be selected regularly on 14 January.
Thumler said that the Red-Green Government must now decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, does not make sure that the country day may easily decide its self-sufficient solution.
The CDU Fraction will, of course, be decided on the Sunday on its further procedures.
The country's consideration also provides the possibility that the country's day belongs to the President of the Ministry and chooses a follow-up.
"Our opinion provides several options.
These possibilities must be tested justly sauberly," said Thumler.
"Man will be discussed in peace with all questions if they are correctly tested."
Thumler named Twesten Step "but something curious."
The politician himself said, "I'm not a representative.
I feel very good."
She was named as an additive of black green.
The Greenes requested the abbreviations of the Secretary-General to restore their countrymanagement.
"We are sure that she has received her countrymanship, which she has received on the Green Landes List, with a faster effect," shared meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korners, the President of the Land.
The Fraction Chairman of the Green Anja Piel said, "We take the decision of every threat."
She decided not to take a discussion in the Fraction.
"And before the background that there is no content difference, we can't fulfill this step."
SPD-kandidate Martin Schulz condemns the transition of the Netherlands Green Agreements every weakness to CDU as a rat.
"The behavior of the old Green Agreements in the low-sheets is not only rat to the choices and choices, but also the Red Green," wrote the Office of the Social Democrates on Facebook.
He supports the decision of the President Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly choose the country day.
The expenditure of Twesten costs the majority of the Red Green in the Neighbourhoods.
The politician is criticized "in its past eating and in its flood their personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scanal that the CDU in the low-shess with this painful intrigue game and trys to struggle the political capital."
Slowschassen's CDU-fraction chef Björn Thumler wants to recommend its delegations to take every weakness to the CDU.
The Fraction Leader of the SPD on the contract day, Thomas Oppermann, proposed Twesten to discharge the result of the 2013 Landtag Selection.
The CDU was the most strongest power of the SPD, the SPD and the Green had in the country day but a dark majority of a voice.
Agricultural Minister in Interview - How are we protecting us from Gifeiern, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses the tested eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in interview with the Redaction Network Germany (RND) talk and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer be protected from the promised eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look exactly at the eggs in your cockpit and to check the stem pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Life Warning.de, the contract countries include the most recent information on the involved oilcargen.
The relevant eggs should be deleted or returned.
Even if, after all we know today, a health danger is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the declarer from the Ministry of the Budget Economic is not really true?
Food monitoring is the task of the Member States.
However, my house has been unreasoned and has been known by the interests of Germany in an interview with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are used for consumers.
The trade is as well as the manufacturers concerned that the sale products are increasingly increasingly and healthy.
If the maximum reserve of 0,005mg/kg is overflowed in the oils, these are not able to transport.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and disappointed.
This time, the operators are not guilty.
Sitting productions and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current recognition state, the production industry is not directly guilty.
Moreover, they must calculate legal practices of services with economic diseases.
As always there is too few controllers in serious cases.
Is it missing only in the personal or also in the key competence?
It was just the official controls that discovered the process.
However, it is also that food and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100%.
It is therefore a consecutive statement and the transmission to the State authorities in cases in which crimes can be presented.
I have already made more clear that I have expected an unexpected statement from the responsible authorities.
Is the regular alarm in food channels really necessary?
The consumers and consumers have the right to obtain safe and transportable foods.
If a non-autorised insecticide is used in the food economy, consumers and consumers are lawful.
This means is the manufacturers, manufacturers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
It is essential to be clear: the legal use of insecticid fipronil in the maintenance of living supply animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately.
There must be consecutives on all levels and work with high pressure.
I hope by all the competent authorities that the sachvery will be declared increasingly and increasingly.
How the financial rules of the football on Neymar's environment to Paris
The rules that refuses to prevent uninterferenced expenditures of European football units, Neymars World Record Transfers from Spanish Barcelona to France-St. Germain.
There are any consequences for Paris Saint-German from the EUFA, since the leader organization whose European game has observed the power to provoke men from access to the prestigious champions-league turniers.
Financial Fair-Play rules, which have been called by the EUFA in life 2011, means that PSG must be demonstrated that Neymar's transfer was financed without great loss.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to carry out the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a holding which will take more than 10 million dollars per year.
There are some of the financial aspects of Neymars to France.
PSG can safely make the money locker so that Neymar sign and bring it into another galaxie stars, in view of the financing of the team through the energy reigned the family of Katar.
The United States may use a lot of money for the construction of players, but with legal income sources that can make them the Break-Even point in their football business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to EUFA President in 2007.
The early French player believed that the United States who had taken great crimes in their efficiency after success were efficiently couraged and risked to destroy themselves when banks or owners return their support.
In 2011, FFP was deployed from the concentration on the crimes of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.
The amendment means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea originally in 2003 - buyed a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the humanity and build a global mark - to a serious matter.
During the current three-year-year FFP agreement period running until 2018, Club's losses can be taken up to 30 million euros.
And although Platini 2015 has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade, his EUFA followers Alexander Ceferin continued to be disturbed of expenditure.
"Firstly FFP is not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, which is responsible for the EUFA for FFP, against the Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid the buy-out-class of Neymar in a breakfast, it can distribute the payment for the accounting statement on the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a fifth-year contract so that the total of solutions for the next five years may be expressed in higher 44,4 million euros in the annual conclusion.
The first wheel of FFP-scanctions in 2014, the PSG with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, has occurred with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG has received a 60 million euros (also 82 million dollars), which later were raised to 20 million euros - and it was recommended that the men's members for the championship league of the saison 2014/15 to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
The EUFA is searching for clubs that could try to overcome their financial view by exceeding their income by companies linked to the ownership of a club.
While a category company could spread PSG if the value of the sponsoring should override the standard markets, the EUFA would not apply this as legal income.
That was the case of 2014, when the EUFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsors was deleted from Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that a part of the PSG payments in Neymar on the payments of the WM 2022 Organization Committee in Katar.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 have concluded that Neymar WM members would be able to find such manufacturer for the EUFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG means that the EUFA will be more careful to observe each trial to implement the rules.
The EUFA had no preparatory conversation with PSG on Neymars Transfer, and told people who were trusted in the situation on Sunday.
They said under the conditions of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The recent published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has received a winning of more than 10 million euros with a 542,4 million euros.
The accounts for the last business year must be yet published.
PSG expects that Neymars arrives a blessing for Sponsoring deals, Mercandising and Trikot selling.
The Agreement states that the measures of the signing will increase at least 30 per cent.
The Spanish liga was uncertainly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's route by saying that PSG would lose the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial Doping" with the club and the State," said President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daytime AS in relation to the recent property of Katars.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, which is the agreement in the possession of an American sport tiscoons, shares the preservation of La Liga against a State financing a Covenant.
"It is the consequence of the property and this has changed the whole football landscape in the past 15 years," said wengler on the Sunday.
"If a country has an agreement, it is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country."
Swiss is searching for a new school provider
In the past years, Chocolat Frey Board school made for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is before a possible end: the air community rewrites the task.

Branchen-in-sides estimate the task volume of the "North Westweiz" to 1,5 to 2 million Frances - the Migros daughter has a year amount of a billion of Frances.
However, it is always more important to the outcome effect: for a shooting manufacturer it is a prestigious task.
As many competitors have in the new statement, the Swiss does not want to raise.
But only Switzerland manufacturers are in question.
According to the journal report, Chocolat Frey will try to renew the Treaty on Birthday 2018.

Nostalgie goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade detective" in the Niki
This story is the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characteristics of the 80s, for the 90-year-year-green-year-year-year (as David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch-Comédie "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that means, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd.
As a cultural artefact, it is likely a parody and a corruption of our Facebook powerful Era permanent reminders.
But as Francis, it feels like the time would be good.
"First Day of Camp" worked well surprised, not only because of his absurd humor (it has obtained an original story for a speaking dose meat which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
While they are hidden on the kernel of the gags - Shooters playing middle age children who are growing - they made the possibility to win the last part of the wheel.
"The Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotional and his parodie goes more after the thief price, including a riff on the 90-year-year-old film film like "The hand that Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that looks at the bread").
At one point, a character is raised by a Apple PowerBook, some inline scates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central history are the same.
The favorite Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, Katie (Marguerite Moreau) has not yet forgotten.
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his youthfriend yet.
And there is another crazy-body plane, in the Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good fulfillment of Michael Ian Black).
As always the excuses are the best part of Francis.
It's especially happy to see the young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons sublimeable of "Singles", who's ancient Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like a old boy.
There are the moments of random vagina that could receive this French as a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" Serie, until he gets that I am as his logical conclusion, "With Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", which last scene will be shown the band as she will visit the filmprises of "With Hot American Summer".
"Comrade detective" in Amazon remembers in a different way of Nostalgia: the re-review of the Cald Wars of The Americans, at the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his East-geen-West-West Ringkamp Iconography.
The committee created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of eight years with the two copies as friends, two officers of Bukarest, who fight for truth, attheism and the way of Marxisme Leninism.
The main roles - a hard cutting Gregor and a idealist Josef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (e.g. an exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt will be synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than a idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look (the police breaks the time to see the shoes in the TV, how the Americans may do it with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - under Jenny Slate, Nick Offferman, Mahersala Ali and Chloé Sevigny - is concerned for a comprehensive game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade detective" is so intensive for the truth of a propaganda drama - a killer who takes a reagan mask - that often plays like one.
In six long episodes, the comédia is not quick or often enough.
"Comrade detective", which has been edited at a lower length, could be better offering his Agitprop-Satire, since Gregor and Josef always visit the American message, which the lobby is always placed from two hot men who break a Hamburger.
The message for the imagined communistic public is that the western culture can make everything for a football.
The effective Roman Creators did not wrong: we do it even with our own young history and with their own.
Drug Mafia in the country
The police is a fight against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Wurttemberg.
On midnight, in the Blackwald Bar Cress, in Rotweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched for many objects, as the State Government of Constance had reported on free day.
15 accused in the age of 25 years and 77 years and already rejected charge commands against these.
Furthermore, the officers set up a larger number of Marihuana and Cocain, shoes, and more than hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were established in Italy.
According to the two persuaded Italians, it had German shipping orders.
That is why both will be delivered to Germany.
The action was participated in Italian and bayers.
All were more than 300 cops in the use.
The members of the Mafia are proposed to organize drug crime, severe military, testing murder, rabbit and expression.
Since Saturday 2016, the State Government states Constanz against the organised drug trade in the South-East room.
between the State Offices in Constanz and Palermo was a rural exhaust and the representatives of the Cripo Rottweil had nearly a day contact with their colleagues in Sicilia.
That is why the biggest income was also joined from four employees from Palermo.
In the visions of the investigations, in particular, Italian state members have rejected a relationship with the Italian Mafia.
Also, a case on May 27, in Hofingen, when several ships were cut in a gatehouse, there was to go to the account of the band.
While large ships in the foreign register
"Dates of citizens that should not be achieved": a report follows the foreign register in Germany.
This leads to a part of a graved missing decisions in asyl procedures.
The advice for the Flight Management of the Agreement, France Jurgen, has noticed that a media report has taken into consideration the major ranks in the foreign center registry.
Many in the data registered there may be carried out in asyl procedures and displacements "in part-grave missing decisions" in an analysis that provides the "South period".
In the register, 10 million people have been considered with foreign states, including 5,7 million of non-EU States.
The data will then be administrated by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data were not sufficiently satisfied, the quality of data in parts was not good for a long time.
In the same case, the data were found from 1921, "of people who are not longer in life, or of citizens who have become German citizens, and really should not be able to achieve in the register."
"Failable data inputs can be very sought of return processes," says the report continued.
The EU citizens have been considered in the statistics on expenditure obligations, which have no need to escape.
However, these false adjustments have been led to a distracted debate on the transition with expenditure, and then it says in the analysis.
Furthermore, the Agreement Government has openly started to return flight families with 16-year-old children to Italy when they are out of there.
This comes from an internal paper of the migration and flights (BAMF), reports the "New Oxford Journal".
In the paper it says that the BAMF leads such procedures "consistent families with children, with exception of smoking and smaller children - to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, it was practically impossible, so that the magazine was under reference to the difficult situation.
After Dublin Agreement, it is competent to fleets of the EU's country that they first are achieved.
If a migrant continues in another EU country, this State can re-envoy him into the country.
The Office is now writed: "Inziden has increased the capacity of achievement for families with minor-year children in Italy."
Italy has denied for the capture and accommodation of family guarantees.
Although the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) is sufficient for these contracts.
In addition, other EU States would re-envoy flows in the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the Left Fraction in the Treaty Day, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Family with children, because of the mistake in the Italian asylum system, human rights and a risk of children."
Secondly achieved
Total 220 liter blood of people living in overrien bach has already been available for others.
At least of the twelve citizens who were signed free.
All before Jurgen Greule, who shared with his insight of 100 springs in 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community in the meeting of the Common Council would be prepared for blood.
"It's amazing how our body is created for that, and we will fulfill the spenders respect that make their blood for foreign, even without use," subtracted citizens Carleyinz Kistner.
"A only blood spending helps several people," explained the German Red Cross Leader, Holger Massenbacher, because the conservators are discharged in their parts.
Three people could have benefited from a blood-free.
Eventually reported shipbakers of the actions carried out in the overrienbach in the early year.
"In this year, with 114 Spendern, we received the second best result," said the DRK Credit Manager.
Obviously, the change in the theater house has been brought to higher payments of participants for a few years ago.
Although Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were designed for 50 blood spendings.
Half of so many broken herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stephanie Stoll and your Vetter are ten times 500 miles from their lives.
The Bank of England shall hold the costs at 0,25 %
The Bank of England will notice later that the costs will remain unchanged after the sustainable economic growth and the reduction of the inflation have deployed speculations on an increase.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain "date" when it maintains the income in the middle of a stronger pressure.
The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain amounts to 0,25 %, as smaller members in this month have increased, since the sustainable economic growth has increased support for increase.
In its four-year report of inflation, the Bank reduced its growth prognoses for 2017 to 1,7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that the pressure would continue to be continued to the budgetary income, where the inflation should be attempted to increase at 3 %.
However, they signed that in the next years, cine increases would be necessary to reduce the inflation held by Brexit and said that the credit costs may be more than expected to increase the financial markets.
The members also agreed to return a part of the mammut-conjunction package which was issued a year ago after the brexit.
It will require time for the financial plan to provide more financial instruments for banks from the next February, although it is now said that it will be expected for more than 15 billion £ in the framework of this system - with 115 billion meter sterling.
The Bank said, "In the central prognoses of the MPC, the Bruttoinland product (BIP) remains shortly hard, since the pressure of the real income of the budget continues to consume."
It repeated that "a certain penalty of money policy" would be required to reduce inflation and a "quality greater" extent as to expect the markets.
The markets now prognose the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stated that the increases would be "passive" and "limited".
The following corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and the next year are compared to 1,9 % and 1,7 % prognoses in May.
She has maintained its growth forecast to 1,8 % in 2018.
The pound came after these messages against the dollar and the euro.
The currency falls to 0,5 % to 1,31 US dollars and falls to 0,4 % to 1,11 euro.
The decision does not change after the recent decreased growth numbers have increased expectations to a cyne increase and the BIB in the second quarter of 0,2 % in the previous three months has increased to 0,3 %.
The growth in the third quarter is estimated at 0,3 %, although it is easily obtained after the bank against the end of the year.
The latest inflation report provides a little reduction for budgets that are affected by a higher inflation and smaller sustainable increase, since the consumption will be worse first before it is improved.
She added that the money policy in the next years can't be "hindered", but she added that the ransoms will be obtained to the end of their triangle prognoses "deemly".
The Economic will also be strengthened by the increased application of the British goods, which is to return to the weak fund, which will compense a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision shall be a year after the investment of 0,25 % in the last August, after the EU agreement that caused the view of the fund.
The Bank assesss that it is probably four years until the price and the economy are completely achieved.
Before the last sentence of the bank to the inches, the call was increased after a cyne increase, since the inflation increased the pressure of severe budgets, whereas three political decisions in July required an increase to 0.5 %.
The inflation was cut to 2,9% in June at 2,6% in the past month, although the bank said that it was expected and that it would be restored in the next months.
The Bank said that the override in relation to its objective of 2 % was "ganz" to write the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "The view of the recent retreat of the Swap Rates must be strengthened by the Hypotheken market, since the creditors are looking for businesses and to end the year in positive way.
The market seems particularly good for those who are going out of the existing deals and conclude the new hypothecs, and many with free options and lower advice will always be loved."
NHS (The National Health Service) shall describe override HIV drugs 10,000 people
Patients are received from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in NHS access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England noted that a preexposition prohylax (PREP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high risks around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health service on a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He was ready to finance the process after the executive court confirmed a judge of the Supreme Court, where the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP instead of paying to the local authorities to finance it.
The NHS head of England Simon Stevens was welcomed to be "important new intervention" during the National Aids Trust (NAT), which was signed as "deep moment".
Sexual health clinicals in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first persons that can log on people, and further clinicals will be followed in October before it is introduced in April 2018 to all England.
Preexposition prohylax (PREP) is a result of HIV preparators that are taken before the sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP has significantly reduced HIV transfer in infection risks.
To take PrEP before the community trade means that there are enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken each day or two hours before the training.
To those who are in question for treatment are weak or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinicals, appropriate participants are identified that apply the study, including men, women, transgeners and individuals who have a partner whose HIV state is not controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered in a household can also log in for a possible participation to their local sexual clinic.
The programme will sign 10 million £ and NHS England a Treaty on the delivery of medicines in this week after a international competitive process.
The study shall assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical circumstances as it is used in a large level.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should fulfil and overcome the long-term and successful efforts to protect HIV.
There is another meelstein progress in the more than three decades in the evaluation of one of the most healthy requirements of humanity."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "This is an important moment in fighting with HIV.
PrEP, if it is achieved to needed and dangerous people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemies.
From September, people with high HIV-risico access to this NHS financed test in England to develop a new tool that is really individually controlled and not undertaken with a partner, which leads to improve many lives.
We welcome this announcement very well."
Ian Green, President of the Territory Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be found that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be abandoned.
Now, since PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, the Ministry of Sweden Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and surfaced after monthly periods and a shorter implementation by the Government.
The evidence of how transforming these drugs can be part of our HIV prevention and the transfer of this changed infection can be completed.
This trial brings us a step closer to understand the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study will be carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect persons who are infected by HIV and that it will contribute to the end of HIV in the society.”
The big life lives: Middle and cleave designer tricks have changed these small Earls Court room in a large house
Joanne Leigh, an ancient banker with an immobility, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It's in the first steel of a elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a evidence for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her taxes.
"Therefore I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a lot of bigger room," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this room in Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I loved them and made a offer in this day."
Since the first observance, the 1000 square feet was completely overcome.
Originally, a single room offer with a layout - they had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Staurum and a intermediate shoes to use the great deck height optimally.
"I wanted a high deck, big window, a lot of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
For this purpose, she invited the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high decks and make a home that was not only a development, but also a place for life for Joanne.
The deck was not enough to place two rooms on each other so that the architectonic requirement was made to create an intermediate meeting where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creative to solve the standard.
"The steelwork is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to organize the rooms so that they were attached to each other without we had to buy us.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to create the stair so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the Middle Coast, a classic compound light window of Retrouvius is looking down on the glamorous area.
Getting gold meals, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille explosion sets the style for the program.
The use of speech plays a role when adding theaters, rooms and lights.
At the two ends, a short curridor is shown to leave him longer.
In the kitchen, the speed feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, there are spreaded units place for all behaviors and glass of Joanne.
With a glamorous room, the beauty of the room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combinable cookes are nothing new.
It is particularly that it is a guarantee.
"A little engineering expert went in there," explained Erfan from the steel strengthening, furnier MDF tour.
"It's important, so it's, when you move the door up, very easy."
Thanks to the clear use of rooms and stairs, Joanne could win additional 16 m2, a additional bedroom and a better layout.
"In the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your immobility will be appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, an immobiliar mechanism will be entered and calculated based on the ground size."
Here they have made it to increase the ground area and to use similarly high-valuable materials that make its luxury property to the room.
"The materials are the things you worry and help them to create an emotional binding in a house," says Erfan.
"You don't love you in the electronic stock doses in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can change a lot of good design and increase the number of square meters from something standardly in something entirely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US Immobilien Imperium
Two brothers were four decades after their Italian family founded the dination, in a combination due to one of the most immobilial immunity Victorias in value of over 500 million dollars.
The former Director of the Carlton Football Club and the Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a village in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how to share their property and their business facilities.
Paul wanted to return from the family operation since 2014, but a serious challenge on the separation is found in the Supreme Court.
With her mother Anna, the brothers 38 immobiliers were in the value of more than half billion dollars, collected, since the family had a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and growed into a cave of 160 individual trade business.
It was sold for 1999 for 85 million dollars.
This money has been invested in immobiles, and the Portfolio of De Lutis now contains offices in the city centre, the development area of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and investment centres in the town.
After a agreement with her dead father, Colin has a "First Management and the Governing Personality" in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company capacity and Paul about a third party.
A judge states that this means that Colin owns the value of 316 million dollars and Paul for $176 million.
The distribution of immobilities and bargeld has been considered as a problem point for Paul.
"The distributions proposed by Colin have left him with what I have kept for the best objects," wrote 2015 in a first uffidavit.
In the past Friday, several mistakes found the first audience of the Supreme Court.
The brothers also now fight against the control of the existing business - from Colin, as Paul said, have excluded him.
Colin argued that this is not true, but Paul suggests to manage some incompetent income.
In a former Affidavit, which was made by Colin, he says he hopes to attach the war.
"My Italian inheritance suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, E-mails and reports of companies, including Deloite, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leadership officers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian invaders, operating milchbars and delegates from the late 1950s and buying a business in Brunswick in the past 70 years.
They used the security to buy Collingwood's privacy, in the Colin opened the first Jeans launch of the family.
Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (before 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their own property to their sons.
"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before the judge," wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are not more part of the De Lutis business group, including Colin, that Mark was paid by 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars.
As well as Lukas and Mark, Paul says "the conditions of their financial separation have been violated."
Colin was very declined, although he was a married AFL condition member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their advocates.
Only Colin answered per SMS to say, "I can't really say much," because the case is before the judgment.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to declare me and to take our family names through the fault," he wrote.
Middle 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother’s requirements.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to end in our current war," he said and added that he "forever hope for a solution."
At Friday, this hope appeared to be complete.
"Our matter will be resolved in the next future of the courts," wrote Colin.
Trumps plants a new stab equip to limit the media abstinency of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Political reports that the new staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the media - in hope to keep the chief on the same curses.
This is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new staff officer of the white house, on his first working day with leaders, made a major problem in President Donald Trumps, to give the white house that he wanted to repair: bad information that was put into the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the cooperators that information should be made about him - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would take better decisions if he would have received good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to smoke the Trump by monitoring their media diseases.
The President Trumps relationship with the television is a lot of decades back - and now, where he is in the white house, his television is still strong.
"When Kandidat Trump was worse because of an unexpected reporting, it was productive to show him that he had received a good reporting of states that were to convince," said the former election championer Sam Nunberg in February against politics.
Politics Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep the Twitter story under control, according to six former election campaigns in which to care that his personal media consumption contains a solid lobby price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter history had ever been "sub control" is amazing.
Perhaps these chambers know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets would have contained without their interventions.
Maybe we'll never know anything about the tweets that the Trump has not sent.
If his partners have already made him a few times to keep the worst away from him, they have rejected their efforts.
But no one has been able to prevent the Trump Controvers.
One part of the problem includes that people in a white house, which are combined from competitive parties, always try to propose their own agenda by presenting Trump Material, which may be promoting their views from the world.
Political - completely employed with this story - reported in May on the proposal of the Council to give the President of strategic reasons.
This was a example of the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Accounts and ancient Trump officers say that Trump can reag on negative price sections, especially those with worried lecks, and that he will find out of it where they are.
That was the end of February, as a person who was wrong to the President a copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the stabschef Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a employment" in the white house.
Although Johnson was perpetually broken from Twitter, or that he didn't offer any specific evidence or that he expressed false suggestions in the past and called it.
Trump read the article and began to ask the workers about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the damage stabhead Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "seeked to implement a system to manage and document the paper crowd, received the Trump."
How did it get it?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Maybe he will prove himself as an effective manager as a prize, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still look after influence.
These unchanged factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most accused criminals received post of Europol
Since the address is unknown, the support of the population will be prayed and hoped.
The police in all Europe is sent in this room (virtual) postcards to dangerous crimes on the flight.
Since the addresses of the searched serious crimes are naturally not known, they will be expected and prayed out of the population.
Europol reported on the free day of the action followed by the EU Most Wanted Calendar.
The experiences had shown that many flights were hidden in the former destinations were called Europol.
It has collected 21 postcards for such crimes from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumstwanted, more than 2,5 million times have been considered.
36 of the online searchs could be determined, at least 11 of them, based on indications after the publication on the website.
Traveling on a grave and return to the 'millionary row'
Some of the most popular households of the West Midlands are again with some decided travellers on war foots that have treated one of the gates of the community to require a field before their master houses.
The travellers have parked their 20 lives in a field outside a favorite street of Solihull, which is called "millionary river".
They have brought horses, babys and an army of transporters after they had been cut off in May, but without being cut off by one of the Council's graves to prevent their accidents.
The tattoo group found a smoke in the defence plans and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unlimited to find a way.
Smoking residents took the Council of Solihull, who said that it was "inutile to consider the problem."
A anonymous inhabitants said: "They have gone to the Montgavend after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they have thrown stones to the passors.
The Council must be rejected by shame to implement the fact because he was inutile in the case of the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were moved and now returned.
More have come last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how you take long education to protect their parks.
I live on the streetbrook Road and I am not happy to pay my community steel if the Council can't stop it once."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's amazing that we just have seen the last road of these travellers only to be planned by another road.
The numbers have increased this time and they have even seen a horse in the parking area."
One speaker of the Council of Solihull said: "We are known to us a unreavoided guard in the country on the side of the streetbrook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. We have the necessary legal steps to keep them so quickly as possible.
To support our statement, it is very important that many inhabitants may notify an anti-social or criminal behavior in police calling 101.
This means to create a picture from the situation where the court must check when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise
From the old hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is.
The house before the gates of joy towns is currently renewed and will be opened on 1 March the next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because, with the closement of the hotel of Birkenhof through the periodic environmental company mbH on April 13, 2014, its time was lost about 30 000 nights per year and also income by the curtax.
In 2014, dramaticly increased numbers of fleeting who came to the ground cross, offered the hotel building to the country's construction as a collective income, which was concerned for controvers discussions.
The city prohibited the subtraction of asylum competitors through the establishment of a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not unitrified in the Community Council.
However, in particular, Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interests in the house.
He should keep the right.
The group of Luisenhotels with employee Birgit Scher with a seat in Bad Bergzabern has built the former hotel Birkenhof at a free refuge in Berlin and will make it again to a house of the three-stars-Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joy town object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are named Hotel Luise, Luisen Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
In the past hotel Birkenhof, there is already a long time ago a buildcontainer before the income, and when you get the house, it will be clearly taken a great renewing work.
The bowls were cut off, decks on the part, old bathwaters removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is one building.
It's still much to do until March.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel," said Thomas Scher in conversation with our journal.
Everything should be restored in the Black Wald style.
The rooms will be equipped with a great dance, the input area will be converted, it will be built new windows.
Everything will be "happy citizen" later as Thomas Scher expresses.
"We're going to make a smuck smoke out."
Swimmbad, Wellness Area and a diary room are related to the exhibition.
You don't want to locate the high level of hotels in the Lauterbad, but already on a high inside town level, beton Scher.
The Waldhotel Luise with about 60 rooms wants to make a wide, explains the shirt.
Even individual officers, groups or business leaders should feel well in the hotel.
Talking with OB Julian Osswald and Turism Director Michael Krause has already led, so sweet.
The views of the city are similar to the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After the height of the investments, Thomas Scher will not be determined exactly.
Button under a million euro, he calculated.
The external proposals are also carried out to the President, that is clearly visible.
In an internal office, a large terrace that will be accessible by the restaurant that is publicly.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Free City is a good market."
Russland Affairs: US special members set up a Grand Jury
In the Russian Affairs on the US President Donald Trump, the special mediator Robert Mueller should have used a report that is called Grand Jury.
The Gremium has taken the work in the past weeks, writes the "Wal Street Journal" at the employment of confidential persons.
The magazine explained the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his medicines.
The CNN senter reported that there were already the first proposals of the Gremium in relation to a meeting between Trumps' old son and a Russian lawyer.
The US Secret Services accused the Kruml since longer to be held in the Chairman's election campaign 2016.
Mueller investigates whether there were talks between Trumps election team and Moscow.
In the focus of the remediations, many men who acted in the election war as a representative of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more tramps of private and business environment under the air.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special mediator Trump was personally pressed in the center and investigated the proposal, whether the President in the field of the affairs might have dismissed the justice.
The main issue of Grand Jurys is to check the evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be highlighted.
Great Jurys is therefore also called income rooms.
However, they will be enabled if it is about greater and more comprehensive cases.
The procedure follows closed doors.
The Gremium can also be enabled by the State Administration to provide persons for authorisation under Eid.
According to the CNN sender, proposals have already been issued about the agreement between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
In the report, the persons participated in the meeting were requested to be requested for a statement.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr. were also Trumps Beraters and Jared Kushner's son, and his daily election championer Paul Manafort in the conversation.
Right experts said in the U.S. TV, that the introduction shows that Mueller would not be surprised in his work and that if it should be necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
But it is not necessary to say weird that the Grand Jury will be enabled at the end to decide on the extent of an accommodation.
However, the introduction of the Gremium of the beginning of a new phase in the research and a new reason to concern the President Trump.
In the middle of the new entails, the President used a conversation in West Virginia to make Russ Affairs as a campaign of his political affairs.
"The Russian history is a total finding," said Trump.
The theme gives the democratics a possibility of feeling good because they have nothing other than they can talk about.
His special advice Ty Cobb explained in a opinion, he knows nothing of the introduction of a Grand Jury.
However, this works usually in secrets, he remarked.
The white house enforces any measures that decided the work of the special mediator to "faire" way.
The previous FBI captain James Comy said three times that it would not be detected against the President.
You have no reason to accept that something has changed, it has continued in the statement.
But Mueller was only used after the Trump Comy fired.
Because of this exhaustive projects, he wanted to prevent justice.
Comy said in June before a senate committee, Trump asked him for a view to the remitting against the national security officer Michael Flynn.
The Chairman is due to the investigation under great pressure.
According to the U.S. media, the white house was collected against the specialist and his workers.
The solved speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to leave.
Otherwise, as an independent special member of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affairs on the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller had a position in which he could be threatened theoretically on the doors of the President of the Justice Ministry.
More Senators both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators proposed a law design on the Sunday, after which special directors could not be made so easy.
Antarctica: Gigantic Eisberg is in the Antarctica
In the Western Arctic, a gigantic eisberg solved from the most simple size of Berlins from the skin fishing.
This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research at the Mediterranean.
The over a billion tonnes are severe and 5800 square kilometers of great coloss now runs north and will have two, three years until he's smooth.
He is with 175 kilometers length and a width from 50 to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice-gigants recorded in the past three decades.
There's no danger for humans.
While climate change has played a role when the Eisberg canceled, it is unknown after research.
However, the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and East (NSIDC) is a series of non-regular collections in the region since about 30 years.
In view of many researchers, it may be along with the earthquake.
The cool was a part of the larsen-C skeelfish.
Shelfish smokes on the sea and will be eaten by the great glass.
So it continues to grow in the sea and is regularly declined.
The Larsen-C-shelfeis is nearly from South America at the front of the antarctic Halbinsel.
In the north of this steel fish, the equal growth of growth and disruptions was a few years ago.
A complete shield has fallen down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
Some are talking about that the larsen-C skeelfeis is also in danger, because the previous side has never gone as far as now.
Moreover, the ice board is cut down under spring and can be cut off if a lock on a key room can be interrupted.
The smells of skin and Eisberg doesn't increase the sea speeper because they smoke on the water and the eaper smoke so much water, as it gives it after the smoke itself.
However, the loss of the skeel fish makes it that the glucoses can directly smoke into the sea and much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea speed, however, only in a small way, the British research project writes on the monitoring of Antarctica (Midas).
The larsen-C skeelfeis is the fourth largest skeelfee of the Antarctic's AWI details with about 50 000 square kilometres.
In the transition of the Festival country, it is to 700 meters dick, at the front card to the free ocean around 200 meters.
It's regularly declined there.
"Which it is a natural vision and no direct connection to climate changes is known, the ice screw now comes to a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the best return from the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Under scientists, the Larsen-C skeelfeis has been struggled if the Larsen-C skeelfeis is now grown or will be a long time and may be together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say that it will be less stabil."
But this development will continue decades.
Even if these researchers do not return to the climate change of this giant Eisbergs, they have been cut off in the past decades of antarctic Halbinsels.
This long cycle of Antarctica is stretched on the South America.
Following the data of the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the antarctic Halbine floor has returned from 1950 to 28,000 square kilometres.
The temperature increased back to the back.
The Antarctic Halbinsel has been raised in the past 50 years around three degrees and counted it to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants home tariff in person
Since it is always more difficult to establish free positions, the CDU requests to take out of the employee to be attractive.
First before the summer pause, the Kreistag has 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and employees work for the cross management in Mettmann.
Now, 17 students have their first working day behind themselves.
The teachings of the cross are clearly very learned.
Round 620 reviews were to draw places for this year to be forgiven.
However, there is no further person to achieve the highest requirements and tasks.
Now there are no positions in the cross Mettmann's cross.
In other cases, doctors and engineers and powers of the general management are searched.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the Créistag with the FDP and the UWG, and to achieve the capacity currency in the management.
The administration shall be established in accordance with the desire of the parties "the concept of personal relief and personal development".
The objective is not only to decline short-term needs for employees, but to ensure the future arrangement of the pressure of the competitor, it means.
The entire concept should be achieved within and outside, showing specific measures for the crowns, and containing an educational agency, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
It's a good approach.
Because the cross has to do it with personal problems that you didn't know so before.
Other cities decline good employees and employees and offer attractive conditions.
The talk is of a legal "the competition of the public employer."
There is a high number of workers who separate disease or old conditions from the service.
Thus, the maximum time for trade to not stay without any more positions.
However, Klaus-Dieter people, the CDU's Fraction Leader, goes out with his party still on the common request.
He had already worried in the Crestage for a faust surprise when he opened publicly the personal cost detection and made the rest parts.
The people want to check all the opportunities that allow an expenditure from the Communized Working Business.
"If we don't have a short-term solution here, the Circle Management should also be in collaboration with the citizen cities - a budgetary tariff," says the people.
The CDU is trying to pay better for the employees and employees than the tariff requirement for the public service.
The stocks are currently prescribed exactly, increased or more money only if you move to a higher level that is orientated at employees.
However, the tasks of the cross have grown up in the past years.
First a few weeks ago, new rooms should be established, in which the establishments of the new prostitute protection are concerned.
Not last by the increased number of asylum competitors have Landrat Thomas Hendele and Cire Director Martin Richter a problem: you have too little personal.
Italy smooths the sound to NGO migrant control boats
Italy has noticed the NGOs, which use the saving bodies for migrants in the middle sea, that they cannot continue if they do not keep new rules for their operations.
"When NGOs do not sign new treatment codes, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Mr. Marco Miniti in an interview with the tournical day period La Stampa.
Minitis warning was a day after the Italian authorities had adopted a boat of the German help organization 'Young Rettet' because their humanity had effectively collaborated with human handmaids in a way that would improve the illegal introduction.
The assistance organization, which has been operated since a year, was decreased to exceed the detailed proposals of the Italian State Authority Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and remains the saving of human life our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can't operate in the search and salvation area," said the organization in a opinion to the social media.
"We can judge all the accusations that are currently higher than after we have collected all information and can judge the situation."
The Italian authorities had the boat of 'Young Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is convinced that his destination of shipboat migrants takes them directly from human handlers, and that the smugglers can get away to reuse the ships.
At least one of these meetings was offered only 1,3 miles before the Libia Quest, according to the Act of the State Agency, which was published by Italian media.
The assignment is urged to move on the authority of the Italian southwater, the savings in the area from humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.
Under the Treatment Codex, boats such as the Iuventa, in particular, have a Italian police officer at the boat that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs participated in search and rescue facilities have been made ready to maintain the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-active Open Arms from Spain.
Last on the Sunday, the new rules would be necessary, but acceptable, because they would not bring their salvation actions with themselves "existent changes or restrictions".
Under those who refused to sign, the Nobel Price Organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
In the middle of Miniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the saving measures in Italy was strong in the past weeks, which means that the efforts for the strengthening of the Lillian Czech Watch and cooperation with the local citizens.
"In the last days, we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Ministry.
He gave plans for further talking with libia citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to get Europe.
Attitudes and trials
Thirteen Weilers, the "Berliner Foreign Posts" and two passengers came in Wachenheim in the northern pool to enjoy trials and vision weaknesses for four days.
Three favorite guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Tal appeared to be a good outgoing point for the tours.
The Burg and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to low summer temperatures from the wineberg to Michael Cassel outside their house.
It followed aspects, increasingly on doors, from which you could look long over the wood and the previous levels.
It has always been a longer attempt for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to saline and to the people's feast of Wurst market.
Otherwise, the view point of view, connected by "flow" trials and moderate attitudes.
At the last two days, many heights were resigned.
Chests, stones, turms, burdens, rounds and travels brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the kidneys were attempted in the freeuftinalatorium healthy sun.
Neustadt was also attempted.
After 173 kilometers and about 4500 heights, the group had learned the baller wood from his best side - sportly and cultural -.
Console instead of Rassen - Bundesliga is running for E-Sport
Sit the Sport Stars in the future before computer console, instead of fighting on wind and weather on the stadion races?
It is actually: E-sport is length to a serious branch, to a lucrative business - great stars, millions of fans and large tourners with high gates included.
These also have recognised the first contracts that have been involved at least in this area.
In the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and the last VfB Stuttgart, the Middle of July founded an e-sport distribution and two profiles for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to take up all new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgerman.
He's sure that he's going up to this track.
In the next weekend, the FIFA football-building FIFA in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup", with which the game of various clubs are involved.
Beside Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Indhoven.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E-Sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkussen and Werder Bremen provides an agent for virtual football player.
"The real football has to be involved in particular with the 14-30-year-old, that young people also go to the future," says 52 years old.
And: The United States tried to explore all possible markets, especially Asians.
With the prominent E-Sporters under the Treaty, you may be onlinely above these markets as only one time in the year to send the Agency to Asia.
What is it exactly?
In the E-Sport computer games such as "League of Legends", "Dota2", "counterstreke" or also the FIFA fish simulation on competition levels.
The length, as in the normal sport, has also been set up lips, in which the professions are attached to each other.
And at the Asian games 2022, E-sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it about a right sport?
For many, the proposal is certain to be required.
Ingo Froböse also has been a long time with the question.
For the Professor in the German Sport School in Köln, E-Sport is a sport because he is competent and shows many biological and corporate reactions that also find in the classic sport - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
Furthermore, it needs cognitive capacity, a technical and taktic understanding and a quick reaction capacity.
Professional games should not only train their body and trein their body and treat their food.
"The fat player is a good player."
But Frobles also looks at problems: "Doping will always be more a subject."
Controls are hardly implementable in online games, and the structures of the classic sport missed in the scene.
Positively, scientists have high integrative effects of the E-Sport.
The players are internationally walking, that's like a large global family, there is no intercultural damns.
A study of the Deloite and the interactive interactive negotiation software (BIU) says to the E-Sport a rare growth.
2016, 50 million euros were used in Germany, mainly on publication, sponsoring and large tourners.
In three years, the rate shall be at 130 million.
According to the bottom 2,4 billion euros of the football board, it's a little bit.
However, the E-sport is "not far from the other stayed sports such as handball, basketball or Eishokkey," writes the Deloite Barter.
International is more than many countries.
Large markets are Asia and the United States, where ex-basketball games Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US NRG team eSports.
Hollywood-Shau player Ashton Kutcher invested in the eSport Wetter Provider Unity.
In Europe, there are also some of them.
In a northern school, E-sport was introduced as a training, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the Football Primliga Units are obligated to establish an e-sport party.
"In Europe's comparison, Germany's advantage," explains the VfB's state of Rötterman.
Only in Nostalgia, and to explain the old times, it's not enough today.
It is to maintain the tradition of the Treaty, but the companies are likely to make it on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," says Dutt.
"Then you can't keep that only at the football everything remains like it was."

Michelle Carter condemned by the text that Conrad Roy drags to self-dead
A woman from Massachusetts was judged for two and half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will take 15 months of their judgment behind the gardens, and five years have been raised to assessment.
Carter was condemned in June because of conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Sunday at the hearing, "My family is unfortunate.
My son was my best friend."
Carter stayed free to call.
She was confronted with a maximum threat of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that they and Mr. Roy were also in a psychic disease.
In red holes and a chrome-colored blood, Carter stood there with threats in the eyes, with broken hands and on the bottom of the eye when it was judged.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the State Officer to the Court.
" She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
" She hasn't shown a reue."
But Carter's lawman said it's a "fair circumstances that they're absolutely understood."
The judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he didn't find that you've found "their old or reifegrade or their spirit disease has a significant influence on their actions."
A State lawyer read a statement of Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there's no day in which I don't trust my beloved son's loss.
I want him to be honourable to me and as I'm going to all around. I'm trying, but all of my pains we're going to be with us forever, for his sisters."
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "secure" by the knowledge that she would never share in her brother's wedding or would be a taunt for her children.
"No more to have this only person with whom I was from my birth every day, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," said she.
The case seems to make a legal prevention case, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it to a crime to ask another to be killed.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found by a cool monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case took a national attention after Carter's text communications concluded that she had encouraged him to finish his life.
"When you go up, go out of a building, steal yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent her in the two weeks before his death, while he was with her family in the ransom.
In the moment before his own killer, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All that you have to do is to enable the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit by any price of the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
To the few defensive Carters, Amanda Knox, which was condemned in 2007 by murdering their British inhabitants in Italy before they were spoken freely two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published in Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter rewards feelings and help, not prisoners."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new Mini Lamb of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was able to run as Captain in the audio Cup, it is not a case.
The FC Bayers trusted the Confed-Cup seat a big saison to - Extra Motivation doesn't worry there.
Something was different on his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional clothing was very small, very small.
But there was long and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philip Lahm and no manuel newer, he made his hands to keep his hands.
"The trainer has not announced it," said the Confed-Cup leader behind, after his first use as Bayern Captain.
Good, the situation could be better run than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the Coach could also mean Kimmich.
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the younger players, debts and just out of the permission of C-Elf as player, but he.
Zuckerl is distributed in the loving ones you trust much that you want to keep at the laune.
So, whoever has been exhausted to achieve the inheritance of lahm, can only use a small extra motive.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want to be a player: take responsibility."
On Middle Wednesday, the 22-year-old flowed as a Mini-Lamb over the field.
Right back, that's his position, the white binds on the arm made her over.
And mostly, Kimmich did in this startformation as the one who can also take the road the best in the hand.
He gave indications, trying to lead the unplayed bands.
He had the view of all, while many others were employed with themselves.
It is possible to play his missing fitness (which crazy); Renato Sanches to take out on the devil to the losses of Asia (which also consists); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Salle to not be negative in their first approach in the Bayern Trikot.
That's always good.
Sole lived near Kimmich, Rudy opened before the department, both acted suver.
The Napoli-Storm, in the front of the time, was often hard, and the summer also tried to be successful for a couple of times in the game.
His colleague Rudy said that the result was not as we hoped it.
But he also showed a correct ransom in the debt.
Game training, time change: "For this style I have also been achieved."
How unlimited this Bayern World is still for the new accesses, you have seen at the party in the end.
For example, Rudy gave not one or two in the cataccounts, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich seeked after a couple of kidneys in the back of his new partners.
There he heard of Salle an interesting point, "What happens here, I've already marked.
You just have to win every game in the Bayers."
He never needs to teach the news anymore.

The Bayern Legioner is almost a club college of OFB Capitán Schnaderbeck and fishing with our lady.

Companies satisfy with the Minister of Reinland: Economic loves Wissing Time
It was often incompatible, that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green), was also an economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This shows more than one year in which the new Economic Ministry Volker Wissing (FDP) is in the Office.
rooms and enterprises from the region are discussing TV requests of a wall in the economic policy - and the old Ministry is simultaneously involved.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Company (VTU), says: "Wissing takes the desire of the economic, which the lemke has blocked everything."
The biggest use is seeing Natus in the infrastructure policy: The league end of the car 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the list of priorities of the country.
In this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021, the establishment right will be established.
A role in the plans of the country is also playing the Westumeung Trier, which is in the primary need of the trade plan.
The objective is to take the tracks in December 2020, says the Ministry speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide to support regional, but international competitive enterprises.
The Industrie and Trade Scanner (IHK) tries as Wissing intended to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and stop the trend of German winexports since ten years.
In addition, Wissing has made a open ear for people who want to make a own company, the IHK honors.
In the new Master-Bonus, the training officer Trier sees a additional advance for young educators, says the employer Matthew Schwalbach.
The proposal is an estimate of 1000 euros for the achieved master tests and 2500 euros when solvents are fulfilled within 10 years after master training.
The list of households for the country remains long.
In the planned streets building, there are quick facts to make it to the country on the needed person, says Jan Glockauer, the main employer of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers, which wants to set Wissing in the country operating Mobility, are at least 29 places.
The IHK requires more tasks to forgive external offices.
CDU-fraction vize Christian Baldauf refers to the calculations of the account office, the country invests 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the achievement of land streets than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as it wants to move the shipman in the region.
Increasingly, it is more serious than the previous broadband building in the country.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated the network care in an IHK review only with the note 3.4.
They assess about hard Internet connections and publications.
Eveline Lemke is currently out of the policy and still sits in the supervisory Council of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Fraction released Lemke to April to be the President of a private high school in Karlsrue, where it was already raised back the field after four months.
Audi will change 850,000 build vehicles - the car producers seem to be confronted with a reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company is the view that "the intellectual options are increasing than vehicle limits" and that is the European cities - under the municipality where BMW is at least - to provoke or restrict the vehicles.
It was known on the Sunday that three million Mercedes passengers would change in Europe to reduce its diel emissions.
No of the companies described the undertakings as return.
European vehicle manufacturers have strengthened the use of such vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the maintenance of rules for cool dioxide emissions.
But the Stickoxides, emiting diel engines, apply as carzinogene and can cause asthma.
The costs for vehicle manufacturers to install gases that are excluded by such vehicles, take also what is difficult to maintain the price of the car.
The German Bundescanzler Angela Markel is also encouraged to prevent powerful companies and ignore the signs of the problem.
The companies try to refuse people cars, which could regulate the emissions in order to maintain the regulations when a car was carried out, but back in normal vehicle conditions.
In the United States, several people cars were attached, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month, the previous leader of the thermodynamic was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore is not protected before the delivery and could be sent before the United States.
In the beginning of this year, Audi was in German criminal reports in the people cars after the Audi committed a system to carry out the emission rules in Europe, and a question that was focused on the United States was extended.
Audi's relationship in the investigation could be difficult to lay people cars: the Luxus car producer brings superproportional to win people cars.

Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published Cartoon characters, the knollens of his figures are his marks.
In addition with 85, the argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "but there is too much pain in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a Spanish son in Buenos Aires.
In the first years, as a artist, he smoked himself among others as a signer for happiness cards - what he frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my employment life was the day as he died in my job," he said once.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he had the end of the 60 years of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoon in Paris Match and then in the "Sterne" and other guided magazines around the world.

Lavendel from the provence of climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in South Africa, but there is a warning that he has been able to change climates.
The Lavendel is increasingly because of the circumstances and the insects carried out in the disease, what scientists and agriculturals who try to find solutions are prepared for great head pains.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research CRIEPAM in the Provence, said: "The lavendel in the Provence is effectively dangerous because the plants in the past years have been implemented the impact of climate changes that have brought many smaller rains in the early year and in herbst.
This has effects on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cycade, a microrobacterium, which is overrided by cycades, and there are very many of them."
And it's a lot in the game.
Lavendel olive is not only for uruguays, it is also very demanded for parfum and cosmetic.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having a very long planet plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, developed and missing or weak.
So we have less parts with ethical oil."
The solutions to be considered are a better water distribution and the desire of destruction from the ground, but also the depth of plants with a protective mixing from sound and water and the development of sorts that are more resistant to trockenness.

The murdering of a journalist is understood the growth in Mexico.
The co-operators of the week-time Riodoce regularly meet their plans for reporting on the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through the organizated crimes, corrupt employees and inevitable drug wars.
But on this day, in the darkness of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was reported to them that it is important to change their routine.
Two higher journalists discuss what you feel safe: you should take their children with the office, which 2009 were the objective of an attack with Granates, or let them go home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front side of the room: Gegner, Neutral, Library.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is required, resources and feelings of bathroom.
There are drugs mugglers, politicals, business leaders, journalists who are depressed to stand on the government or card list, a catalog of crimes that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest of the violence, and while the body is grown throughout the country, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was attached to his office in December 2012. 589 stayed after attacks and drugs under contract protection and until this year it was at least seven dead in seven States.
Under the last ones, her manufacturer and her inspirator of Riodoce, the company Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in relation to drugs.
His failure will be deeply reflected, although his existence exists all overall - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his medium-finger with the word "Justice", is attached to the fashion of the Riodoce Gabe. Two reporters in the three-year-old years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, brings T-shirts, who show his funny face with brill or his typical Panamahut.
The Workshop finds less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their alp dreams, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although 2010 a special contract Office has been established to edit the cases of journalists, it has been introduced to the Committee on Protection of Journalists only two crime procedures.
Like the majority of thousands of killers who are connected each year with drug trade and organised crimes, the murderers of journalists will only be sent before judgment.
In Riodoce, they still have to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unfortunate and even though the earth is still more distributed.
Without information about murders, without justice, Ibarra has a few useful discussions on the security debate, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to lose my time in this workshop," he said.
"When we don't know why, we're all disturbing."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the journal of Riodoce in the country capital of Culiacan.
He just made it to go a few blocks away before his royal Toyota Corolla was stopped from two men. He was struck out of his car and 12 times was shocked on him, probably because of the name of the journal - which is translated with "Twitter Fluss".
The protector went out in his car and hurt it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Faithful to reverse in Culiacan free.
But for Valdez, there is nothing practically as swallowers.
Sinaloa became one of the most bloody fields of the country, since the Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery in the United States in January, because rivaling fractions were fighting here to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people in the streets will be explored or that the peacehouse is full of broken, two-shirt muscles for drug kings who are greater than many houses for life.
Remember for a minute that there is a state of "Ruhe" if only one cartell has the control over the cost state with its valuable heads and drug hands routes in the United States.
However, while the fact that Valdez had known the risks of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a partner and director of Riodoce, with guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misconscious understanding have been attached to the murder.
First in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartell fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publishment may have suffered the sons, condemned gambling members buyed each exemplar of the exemplar of the output while they were released to the journal kiose.
The second mistake was not to cry Valdez after the proposal of another journal that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.
Valdez was a league in Mexico and outside, and his death is considered as a milk stone in the Mexico violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He was 2003 as an experienced reporter for Northest when he sold five colleagues to build Riodoce together and sold 50 US participations.
In Sinaloa, "If it is impossible to get journalism without stealing on the exchange problem," said Bojorquez.
At that time, the journal was worthy of a call because of the courageous and honourable reporting, and the use and publication were taken.
Reporters loved to publish severe studies without fear of Zensur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read his stories that nobody could be treated otherwise.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for their reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his strength in the persecution of the Mexico drugs history, whereever she has been led to.
He gave freedom that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said during the CPJ exhibition.
Drug trade in Sinaloa "it's a way of life," he said in the past October in a interview with Rompewinto-TV.
"You must take the job that you will be fulfilled as journalist - or that or you play the dumps.
I don't want to ask, "What did you face so many dead... Why didn't you say what happened before?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the beauty ball that could smile as a honey worker, was the friend, who was greatly amazing with circumstances and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He'd always take his hut.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love to rutin his destruction?
His death also has committed them to make their own acceptances in question how they can do their best work and remain in life.
"They do not like if you move with their women, their children, their hard businesses, their home starting and landscape," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-ssur and self-sharing.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away.
The mistake is, the writer of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "the greeting can be broken ... and then the thing is happening with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - exactly not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States in which a future mixing of lucrative smoke routes, low institutions and corrupt government officers.
The landscape is continually changed.
In the room where the employees of Riodoce came to safe training were no telephones allowed. Days before it was known that Spiware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police protectors were looking for 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a building.
They were invited to protect the offices of Riodoce in a quarter-term building in a central class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the chair, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were the 50 percent of the police, which the Governor himself was not confident.
There are months ago since the reporters have gone to the mountain country where the drug banks are under control.
For the output of this week, Riodoce exploded on three main storys.
There was the death of the brother of the old known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure to the State expenditure that focused on the town of the Governor.
And there was a group that carried out in one of the worst restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the State official.
There was no official word about who was conducted or how it happened, so it was commanded to be writed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a lovely location of drug managers and authorities.
A reporter concluded public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which notes the Regional Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which almost all political levels ruled at the age of the century.
Before shortly, several PRI manufacturers were accused of high carried accidents of corruption.
Villarreal requested the reporter to write about previous cases in this local, including a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was a military accident.
Only a few months ago, the readers had considered the column of Valdez as the best information source on the introduction.
"Previously, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the spitname "El Flaco" because of his weak body state.
"Now all the channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The office of Valdez was turned to the maintenance room for signs and oppressors that protest against the murder of journalists, because the workers had become something that they had never expected: activity in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez ran a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the State official.
Salvador Adame lost three days after Valdez was killed in the West Contracting State of Michoacan.
A burning body was discovered and the officers said, based on DNA tests that it is his.
In the whole country, journalists have become louder than they have writed in the organizated protests "SOS Press" on grounds and buildings.
In this day, the Register Bojorquez is departed in Washington and trys to collect international support for justice in case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spending journalists and to kill them because they said the truth.
She may have requested her to be repartited by the Government because she is concerned that her wealth has lost her objectiveness.
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were organized crimes, participated government officers and a equal society "committed".
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that the reporter would not only be killed by drug banks, but also on the command of political and security forces that were attached to the organizated crime under a deck.
The media guarantee group "Articulo 19" has attached more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officers in the past year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murder has a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Mary Elizabeth Macias in the north border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was signed by the Zetas card: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and heading locked near their heads.
Some films have chosen to close, as the magazine El North in the north border of Chihuahua after the murder of the Correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others do further how El Manana did from Noevo Laredo after the murder of their director in 2004.
2010 the Diary de Ciudad Juarez published publicly to the drug cards with a direct article on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exil, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers.
And sometimes they will be raised, as it appears to the Photographer Ruben Espinosa, the 2015 with four women in a apartment in Mexico, three months after the flight from Veracru.
For those who remain back and continue work, it is a daily dancing with risk decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a single hair, gives the drug trade to shot him.
"Mexican goes to hell, and so I was reporter," he said.
To the midnight on the last Friday, when the last output was already finished, Riodoce was sitting on the citizenship front of the office and tranched beer, as at once all their phones began to summarize.
A number of shoes with bander rivals and security forces near the Badeort of Mazatlan had 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to scanish how it was promised by a number of Cartell bodies in the region.
They have published the news on the website of Riodoce on the phone.
The title page should be changed on the next day.
Siren smoothed nearly - another shoe in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who held the watch to see whether they were ready.
If they were very afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the violent portrait of the falling grounds of the journal, which was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the co-operators of Riodoce followed his springs.
"How can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day when Javier was killed, the Practicans asked me to send them to reporting them on the streets."
Dinosaurier tarnning used to remove his enemies
On the first face it looks like a state, even a terrible.
Now researchers have discovered that the first recognition of the unbelieving Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker was so good that experts have described it as Mona Lisa of Dinosaurier.
It was so good that they could even determine that her shocked hair was a rock - and they said she had something from a "unruled past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" refers to it as "the maintained dinosaurier who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurier exemplary of the world."
Fossil is a newly detected type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the credit time between 110 million and 112 million years.
His incredible state has a well-hearted state of researchers who describe it as "really attention"
According to reports in National Geographic, the packed plant fresh is the most fasil of its type.
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Milenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He found something that seemed missing from the rocks on the place, and decided to look exactly.
The detected fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They took the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg).
After all this hard work, the perfect result is now ready to be fulfilled.
"If you just look at a little with the eyes, you might think it's sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is to see.
"It's going to go into the history of science as one of the best and the best gained dinosaurier explosion - the Mona Lisa of the dinosauriers."
Researchers have discovered that this plant fresh, although he is covered with a disaster and like a walking panzer, probably was cut off by flesh fresh dinosouriers.
The strong panzered dinosauriers used a red and white tarnation to hide himself before rabbits, and uses a smoking technology that is known as a cooking, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have been allowed to meet better in his environment and remove his enemies, tell experts what means that it has been broken by greater dinosauries.
The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier has first made shoes in May and now is to see the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta marketmitchell after the museum technology Mark Mitchell, one of the teams who had been driving over 7000 hours to detect it carefully.
The wonderful maintenance of the Exemplar allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the motive and the form of shoes and shoes over his body.
They discovered the contrary, a wide protection method in the animals, which means that the skin of the creation was dark than their subside.
Although the concentration is usually, the results are surprised because the size of Borealopelta is exceeding the living animals today.
It indicates that the dinosaurier of enough pressure by flesh fresh dinosouriers had been achieved that the evolution had enjoyed the difference of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the time Genesis animals that use the contraction - you think of rows, zebras or birds - are much smaller and worse than the beat, which signifies that this nodosaurier was made a real fight for survival.
"Starkes raubtier behavior on a massive, strong panzered dinosauriers show how dangerous the dynamiosuriers should be of the credit time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis organic connections in their scales also show that the hair of the dinosaurier's rotbraun was.
Scientific scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including his conservated darminholds, to find what it has eaten as his last age.
They believe that the dinosaurier, when he died, was cast into a river and went out into the sea, where he was on the back to the sea.
At that time Alberta was so warm as South Florida today, and the flowers and the oceans probably broke more landscape than they are today.
"The nodosaurier is really aware because he is completely covered with a conservated scarlet hair, but also remained in three dimensions and includes the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks nearly like in the past cross time.
You don't need to use a lot of phantasie to rebuild it. If you're just a little smoking with the eyes, you can almost believe that he's on sleep."
The cross time was a time, as a serious theropodes, a serious dinosouriers who stood on two feet, traveled the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyransaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, was raised by some of his curious procedures.
It includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of severe monster.
Scientific scientists who appear to the most recent recognition in the Factory magazine Current Biology believe that Borealopelta has been mumified after death in the sea and in the slamm.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Milenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the maintained dinosouriers of the world, including the wood and the desert, and is completely from the sneeze to the top.
The creatures were in the middle of about 18 feet (5 meters) and driving up to 3000 pounds (300 kg).
It covered two 20-Zoll-length shops that ran out of his shoes.
Researchers believe that the plant fresh has been broken through the West Canada until a overflower river flows it flows into the open sea.
But the subwater control of the dinosaurier was maintained by his disposal in exquisite detail.
The closed oversight of this special exemplars are so good that the Höges are still able to cover hot panzerplates beyond the dinosaurier.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it is such a level of maintenance as a wine in Lotto.
I'll see it more than I'm seeing that it's gonna be disappointed.
The locked rest of the hair still covers the hot panzer platts that carry the skin of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are priced up.
I can count the shoes in his soil.
In the weight: Mass carramic board on A8: Many losses
The heavy accident on the A8: buttons 30 vehicles are developed in a massa carramic board.
There are many losses, kilometer long stairs - and gaffers.
On the car train Stuttgart-Manch (A8), the afternoon Donnerstagnach midnight has been lost at about 20 people in a massa carrambable.
After the first data of the police, there were 17.00 p.m. between the Adelzhouses and Odelzhouses (Landcreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a traveler was about 30 vehicles, which probably also washed.
The exact number of losts was first no information.
It's about easy to the average losses, a police speaker said.
A great order for saving vehicles was on the accident.
The A8 direction was completely locked.
In the driving direction, Munchen appeared about 10 kilometers long-term back.
As a AZ reporter reported, it also came to massive disasters - through a lot of hosts.
The firewall was noted the signs of the vehicles that now have to be calculated with receptional crimes.
A shortly after 18:45 there was a second accident in the A8, this time between August and Dasing.
It came to a collision between a car transporter and a pkw.
A rescue shooter was on the way to the accident.
German area: Conzern tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everybody has almost almost almost almost lived: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deceived in his work and has just a great thought.
And then: pufff.
The shepherd comes and wears an insensitive or reaches the travel gas inside of the workflow.
Check cards.
But the time of the interruptions is immediately complete.
The German front tests the untrusted vehicle card control.
You just confirm by phone that you take his place and assess the car cards.
A test operator is currently running on two streets.
"Come on the offer, let's get it out.
There will be, therefore, at the beginning of the next year, many more travel traveling travellers in Germany," said a front speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the travel card assessment without shopper.
In order to use the use, however, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to want a online ticket -- whatever the most travel passengers have already been doing.
It also needs to be about the app of the board that buyed the DB navigator, which is the best type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works so: You're up in the ship, calls his cards under "My tickets".
There appears to be an electronic assessment button in the tests.
The passengers received a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is located in the travel and entered the boxed Y seats.
The accommodator comes at the vehicle card control at the place Y knows that there is a passegger with a already-based online tag.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to suffer.
The "Check-in" has two previews: one for the customers, one for the board - what to use the passors again.
"Whoever wants to travel without ticket control through our accessopersonal, just checks in the DB navigator itself.
This allows the travel passengers to build their travel time in the travel,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing condition of DB Travel.
Second plus: "and our partners have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs."
Whoever often travels, he knows that near disappearing and override trains are the controls of the cards to the largest arts.
Because often you have yourself, but in each case, one of the travelers does not add all documents that you need to evaluate online tags.
Or there is no credit card or personal indication or other documents you need to demonstrate.
The consequences are infinite discussions between travellers and traveling passengers, which lead to the worst vote in parts or large rooms and procedures in control of their own tickets, and the shepherd at the end takes the time to take care of other requirements.
Only a small number of tests can use the new service.
And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food.
Other track numbers on the same streets are not yet active.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked up until her neighbor.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Gebornen sitted on the bed of a airband room that she cut and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stole on a mail from someone from the high school.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," said it.
Forget that nobody else has sent the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah has always been visited on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., was killed to live in the second.
He put a picture of Browns leblous body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours.
"This is very wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her phone to return to tweets later on the Canfield drive.
There were photos from the policeman and people who write, and from a man who said to be Brown's father, who brought a shield with the record: "Ferguson's police just killed my unwashing son!"
She observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrants with a single dog.
In another video, she said, a policeman solved his weapons and cried, "I will kill you all animals."
"It's not usually," she remembered Ferrell.
"This is not the kind of murder that we used to be able to call typically."
In this moment, I felt shootful.
I was weeping and weeping."
She bought a ride and went home next day.
After the landing at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter out of the house of her father's house and decided that both would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the Kinos from 11.
It is a story of overliving and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which is from the view of people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to request answers.
As Ferrell with her daughter who brought a flower cloth and a suitable crown came to Ferguson, they both discuss a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state.
"Do you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her,' Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a high point of that... what happened in the past.
You need to know it and see it and get into it.
It must be well developed, not only activists and organizations, but also the different skins of black experience and black conscience and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the happiness to give you a experience in which they don't personally have an eclatant rassism, it is not different than the next black girls.
I feel that I would show you a bad service to keep them far away."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florian Road, a place against the police authorities who were in a campaign area when the actives waited for the possibility of non-acceptation by officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business officer, which made lunch.
They were prepared for and helping them to continue to the demonstrants.
Lately began to accept a new type of activity for Ferrell Gestalt.
"My activity has been totally changed after 9 August," said she, and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Miniority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essen Justice and Health Unlikeness in black communities.
"I had no experience in the organization.
It's all coming."
After week, Ferrell found Ferrell during a night-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-registers of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell in the meaning, "Will you file or try to find a story that you can use?"
This shop was produced by innumerable cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited by their pain and their resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We heard that people who were born and growing in Ferguson did not focus their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already cooperated with the Damon Davis co-register, a artist of the area known for his activity of death insects.
His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer, together with six other inhabitants followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's exploitation.
"This documentary film is not one who speaks to us or talks to us.
"This was the main thing for me as these people are shown, because I will be shown."
The objective was not to concentrate on the experience of Ferrell - to show that it is in the movement "not about a Mexican leader, but to a community joining," said Folayan - she shows himself as the public participant of the film.
Following showing documents of "Whose Streets?" surprised personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she loves and married her wife.
"I felt as naked," said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the product for the first time.
"But I have understood that it has to give a certain crime in this work and in the multiplying of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black blue women in the larger black-lives mother movement.
Two of the three causes of the movement that, after the killing of the black Teenagers Trayvon Martin in 2012, identified the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.
"Scherry, young women in leading positions have taken the total movement," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight in various areas.
Blacks, youth women must take the main charge of all."
Folayan was worth to note that "the moves are actually held by black women and many black women."
However, she says that "this is not an absenceful type of action," when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film.
"It was the person who threw up this energy," she said.
"It's not a case, although she was before, because in a life on these crowds as a black, sweet woman is so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
In the middle of the newscams in Ferguson are disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police are continued.
Ferrell is considered for 21⁄2 years because of the locking of a car at a demonstration.
She describes the society political atmospheres of the region called her home, "An Chaos".
Nevertheless, she feels committed to this story since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our cats."
From "traum" to "Size Whale": TV reader discuss about Bit Galerie
Bit galerie moves people, although she is not built long.
But the idea of a purchase center in the south of the foot zone, since the first presentation 2009, the population in frontiers and guests.
Calt leaves the theme unless one.
Also on our Facebook site "Volksfreund Bitburg" is discussed the subject.
While one says to a bit-galerie, "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really nice" (Nicole Shoes), it comes from the other side: "No man" (Siggi beds) or very smooth: "Great!" (Lars Schulz).
While the officers build that a gallery gains more customers in the city, where the other businesses also benefit, the guests fear that the foot zone will then be built.
Furthermore, the gallery is just planned on the basic step where the building market is offering its products in 13 direct markets.
At the beginning of the building works, it will be concluded.
The gallery macher wants to integrate a marketall in the new building - and even to the Beda-platz with the possibility for the outside sites.
Simone room: "We've already buyed many years almost weekly in the building market Hall.
In fact, our eggs, but also the precious cookes of the landfruits always like very much.
We've also discovered the treasures for us.
We would like to wish that, while and in particular after the building of the Gallery, there is an opportunity to get this offer right.
In other cities, there is also that.
In particular, the small marketthall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "O whether direct markets are in a market hall in the gallery, it comes to the height of the middle.
The new project should be not just lower."
Eva Kilic: "Why buying place in Bitburg?
Or clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find this overflow.
There's enough in our city.
You see how many laden employees are empty here - some months and years.
However, since there is not a regular week market yet, it is more important that we have at least the market hall.
Because the offered product is fresh, the largest part of the manufacturer will be offered directly and is highly precise.
As you see, loading businesses in a purchase center will be approved only of larger companies, because the measures there are often not trainable for a single manufacturer.
Shade, special businesses are almost no longer, and the rest of it will also be lost."
Wolf Fandel: "A purchase center with a market hall doesn't correspond to me.
And the gallery doesn't correspond to Bitburg.
In particular, where will the building markets go during the building time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time when the bit gallery is actually coming.
Or is it possible to get out all businesses from Bitburg before?
George Marquet: "This will just not work.
And a Shopping center, which is empty, needs no one.
I think it would be better to promote a right building market instead of this gallery.
But for a builder markets, it gives it thanks to many seriously - as I find - unsensitive building projects in Bitburg no more space.
When the building markets are cut off, a piece of culture will be disappeared again."
A suitable similarity: Artists make Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brain, which are almost unmarkablely similar - that rolled on the boxes from the deck.
The 30 Portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tops and heads sent to you by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the previous secret-service analytical had a 35-year-year-old challenge trap after she had been published as secretly entered diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new explanation opened on August 2 is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which discipline associated its competence in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transfrau and dissidentine, which was converted by Barack Obama only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portrats, as a person could look like these genomical data, a serious, even though something intellectual comments not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman, was condemned 2013 for 20 accommodations, including six disorders against the Spionage Health, Computer Depth and Debstail.
Through the prison, her picture was submitted, so much that it had only one photo - a ecological, black-white self, in the man's viewlessly sitting on a travel room, and a plastic plot pressure - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In that way, the artists produced portrets of forensic artefacts such as cigarettes and caugummi, by extrahibiting the DNA from the department to make a picture of it how these people could look.
That was the time she received a mail from a journal magazine.
"They brought a interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portret to join this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new statement.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make an DNA port.
The artists and their arrested museum were to unlike letter friends, which in two years reviewed several letters.
They also create a comic of Shoili Kanungo illustriated "Supppressed Images" which would be a future in which the President Chelseas would turn the judgment and would have to see the explanation personally.
That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings Freeship after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meetings.
There is also now in the opening of the exhibition something deeply and strong, since Donald Trump brings a war against informants from the government's officer and the transgenerary groups to find new, double-capable ways to fulfill the strong splendids that he really should have to improve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for all these things, she said that "the things happen from a certain reason."
In one of the walls of the Gallery, the artistic exhibition requested Manning with its great signature under (the "i" in their family name is considered with a heart) a end of the "auto-speaking, which was the base of the family, the race, the sexuality and the culture."
On the current wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in the plot.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the integration of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the high-developed scientific lexicon of the artists), as significantly similar, at least in biological care, we are all.
"What people will be taken from it is that our genom does not worry about who we are and how open generic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video tools of 2007, Spious Memory is also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different historys, therefore the 30 of these history."
The last piece in the exhibition stored in a own room is a page from the top of the Comic Novelle.
She shows Manning how she appears in hand with a free conversation phone from the Disciplinary Casers of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they make your speech calm, they won," says it.
"So never hold the mouth."
"It came directly out of a letter that she wrote to me," said the artist who saved from Philadelphia.
"I'm still going to get the room when I'm talking about."
Manning has not seen the explanation yet personally - as it has been previewed in the comic book - but if she should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the masks, by their own genomic simulations, which are collected as horses of protestants.
It was also targeted, as all in the exhibition until the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statute), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with plot.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a lot of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the Portrait.
"I wanted to feel like a massage movement that formed with Chelsea, as the move that also stood behind her freedom."
Professor of the University of North Western and an attorney of the University of Oxford for death
A landscape human jagd is a professor in the Northwest University and a representative of the University of Oxford, who are looking forward after a man was explored in a luxury apartment in Chicago with murders.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) Haft Commands for murders were issued for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown the acts of the Cook County Officer.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, was dead after several sticks.
A Community warning system published by the Police Authority of Chicago states that the body was detected on 27 July.
The officers received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several crimes on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was yet explained in the place of the defense for death, and the detective investigate the shoes as a murder, while the police looks actively after the two disasters, said the officers.
Lathem is an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology in the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now encouraging and was excluded from the campus of North Western University.
"This is now a criminal issue which is investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwest University is cooperated in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is the Senior Treasury Assistent at Oxford University.
A speaker of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are ready to help the US authorities at all reasonable ways."
The exhibition added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he would urge the persuasive persons to make the authorities immediately.
"The police has a imagination of their location, and our efforts to locate them, strengthen themselves," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find sustainable.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza Officer, which had just received a rhythm tip, who suggested that there was something in the room 1008.
The police described the scene as a very gravity.
Guglielmi said that it was unknown if the case also found on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Management Team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police currently works at the time and the background of the victim and investigates a number of motives, including a possible case."
"We will conclude the WADA face plan in the near future" - the Russian Vizepremier Muko
The Russian Vizepremier Vitaly Muko said that it would not be long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the Restauration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a specific stage of completion of the criteria of the vehicle plan, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Antidoping).
The WADA background plan has been updated in this view," said Muko on Sunday.
The PM commented the second part of the WADA vehicle plan on the content of the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstallation of RUSADA and published recently on the site of the organization.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could be concerned for Russian Anlass.
"All has been announced, everything will be used.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympical Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria referred to in the list states that the Russian Anti-Doping Authorities should apply publicly the results of the competent investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawman Richard McLaren to nationally promoted Dopings in Russia.
In relation to the question, Mutko said: "We carry the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures are implemented.
But there was no State programmes, and we will not be given anything that doesn't exist."
Mukos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the non-dependent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian RSport RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of past in Russian antidoping organizations, but added: "We repeatedly said that the report contains increasing positions and rules.
Nobody has proposed to accept this report without condition," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the language of Doping Scandals from the WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate and coordinate tests under the view of international experts and the U.S. Antidoping (UKAD).
After visiting the main quality of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to reinstall.
Aldi sold no eggs first
This shared the enterprise groups.
It is about a clean care measure, which could not be further exceeded from any health care, it was mentioned in the communication.
Since immediately, there are only eggs to Aldi, which are strictly negative on fipronil steams.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency in his customers.
The startup-up that will help your companies to be not to the next
Amy Errett wanted to meet the happiness in your e-commerce startup, but the reviews did not work.
The answers were often heavy, little help or - even worse - threatened.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers don't trust to the process.
"It's just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, which involves the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people outside to help.
A new ratio of human resources start-ups is in growth to help companies find out how their cooperators feel.
By creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measurement of the worker enhanced, it allows the company to implement research to apply special groups and demographical groups to offer anonymity and debated hotlines, and, in some cases, allows Whistleblowers to explore the C-suits and directly to the Administrative Council.
"You have now tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?", Jim Barnett, companies and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up, which is used by the software Analytics tools to meet cooperators.
Errett said that they had a better view in what their partners think and feel in the three years of age.
Furthermore, to the Snap-surveys and questions of certain teams, it provides a hitze-card of the company that shows a view to which units have most statements and shows the powers of guidance lowly agreement results - so that you can follow why.
Companies are going to see that they must stay at the field of the workplace culture, so that you don't be the next office that has been developed in Skandale since an older partner has published a blog post, which describes a field of confirmations with those who have spoken.
For the startup as length, this desire is a lucrative business possibility after a surface.
Global Government, regulation and compliance bank may have more than $118.7 billion, after the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, helps the company to prevent and recognize bad behavior, has seen a greater interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber-Falls in Misscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uver has logged in shortly as a client.
As least, Convercent company allows me to send "Puls-" reviews, collect confidential answers in real time and see the warm cards of your problems areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS-hotline, which can report to the workers the bad behavior.
And if the main employee is involved, the advice is directly to the supervisory Council.
"The Court of Public opinion has considered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the citizens and businessman of Convercent.
If a company is found that his cooperators are bad or unethically treated, it can live cost-play consequences by consumer-boyott, worker-function and clothing, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chat with more than 25,000 cooperators and more than 500 locations, has set Convercent for more than one year to ensure that cooperators are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple opportunity to get their business center.
Previously, if an advocator wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company centre, enter a formal assessment and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often a surprise and unreprehensive experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good opportunity to persecute the convictions of cooperators.
Now, since the Convercent company uses Convercent, problems that have been hidden in offices or offices - such as discrimination, condemnation or non-legal practices will be identified and pronounced.
"I can be closer to this universe, 360-grad-scale in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our actions from employment law."
Companies started to take sure the ethics, values and employees' enhancement in 2002 after the writer Arthur Andersen was collected by the Enron Scandal, said Quinlan.
But it ended until the "social media came to their right," that the company recognised that you couldn't stop that their painful growth went online.
"For the use of the technology to monitor the Ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Little and Convercent offer your software as a service service, and launch the companies with recurrence payments for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the agreement of Venture Capital Investors that both started-ups are supported.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February, such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was taken to $47 million.
10 million dollars in November of Besseer Venture Partners and brought his total financing to $60 million.
These investments are increasingly surprised, in view of the retailed nature of enterprises, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex in research, which shows that the current cooperators of their workplaces are more expected than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high holders and interesting projects are only instructions.
The cooperators want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they hear their voices, and that the work you do to rejoice, they feel stronger to make this company successfully," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience in LinkedIn, as well as Convercent and Living.
Providers are available if their portfolio undertakings are well running. Companies are good if cooperators are involved and engaged.
If the analysis tools are promised by thirds, commitment and use of workers, it is not wonderful that you find support.
The data about the employer's enhancement after the experts of the workplace culture.
However, the data are not useful if the manager of a company does not take measures.
In fact, if a company's employer asks your feedback, it may have expected that the change is on the way.
And if the wall doesn't come quickly, or of course not, it can smile and demotive.
"When you ask for 4000 reviews, you have to be ready to have 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Cotter International, the company who have seen too much on the collection of data.
"If you don't follow, you've really heard me?
Are you worried about that?
And who doesn't worry about that, why should I?"
Madison Reed, which is now carried out in the monthly cooperator's request, was in the same day to introduce measures in the same day when a problem is reported, so Errett.
And after the collection of feedback of frustrated cooperators, it was to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training in order to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company has always received new views on the workers, and it hopes that it brings it to a better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high levels.
"If you are not obligated to create a transparency culture, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose the company.
The NCAA has the two-day practical practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's about 23 hours when a lot of UCLA football games are discussed on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus.
Some have gone out their tricotober parts and showed the backs full of weight from the first day of the training officer.
For a good part of the team, these unexpected minutes gives a lunch break.
Players who are inscribed to the submarket resources will be returned back to their conclusion tests before they return to 6:30 to the Football Center at the next morning.
"This is for the boys the next three days a real treatment," said Bruins-trainer Jim Mora shortly before the moon was to dinner.
The NCAA elimines two-day environments to improve the load of the player, and she has actually extended their days - at least to the end of the free day.
Therefore, the first three training of UCLA should be started at 19:15 to be justified for the already packed time plans of the players.
The compromiss from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins moved the camp at nearly one week after the last saison and during the solar school first during Moras's six game times in Westwood.
You must stop during August 18. 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their attack against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA regulation, even if they add a further point to the multiple employed roads of the player.
"We put this big load on her three or four days, and it is very required," said Mora.
"And if they just tried it, they're looking forward, they're good people.
I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will finish their practices while the camp is finished, what is regarding the clear vision lines of its fields from a limited parkplace and the limited Luskin Center, a hotel of the high class, which has already been moved with footballs, which has been explored behind a torpefood, will be no easy task.
Bruins players should set the hotel from this weekend, but Mora dreamed that it could be a problem while this room is free during the saison.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"It's a real problem, and it's not a lot to think that people have a room there, and then they're set up there to record a training.
If you have the video band of a training, it's a very good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on the park 8.
We'll do the best to what we have.
I don't really worry about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify Tatsachen Checking in fighting flat messages
Facebook wants more potential articles with false notifications to the third checker and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on the Sunday. It is one of his trials to fight such fake news.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it would be started using updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and to send them to the facts checkers that may be shown the results of the actual testing of the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for the fake news that many believe that they also have influenced the US elections 2016.
The problem has also become a great political subject in Europe, where the French electors have been transmitted in the field of the presidential elections in May with false history, and Germany supports a plan that will be confirmed after social media networks, if they are not achieved, rapidly fulfilled postings as before the elections in September.
On Sunday, Facebook said in a separate statement to German that in the United States, France, Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new fact-review.
"Beside the recognition of what stories of facting surveys third party are achieved, people want more context to take funded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, the product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook continues to test his features to the "in connection article" and works in other changes on his message feed to reduce false messages.
Create a Comic Romans: A closing in the history of England
In his youngest past, the small Scotney Castle was to see in a squeeze music video and was a cluster for Margaret Tatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent story of his comfortable seats in Bewl River Tal in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphical Roman of Jamie Rhodes, a mofarian Yorkshireman with a preliminary for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead since 300 years," he says weirdly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' springs the time from the center to the period of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. Each story was illustriated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional.
"I just reacted on the damage print on the page of a letter, which was written by a double tablet in the 1700s, who worked for the Jacobine,," he said.
"This is his dream!
And the letters are always smoking, because once they burned a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives after 300 years, the greed has an effect as he himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who was so struck with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Art of Council of England and almost four months lived in a close ("I have been honestly: I have a little overvalued my welcome reason"), it seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodos took his days to discover the victorianic "new" closure to explore the archives and to study the many shoes and curiosity of the cluster, as well as the mounted heavy heads on the walls and the flocks, the centuries of the graves.
He turned through the continent and the runes of the old city, and spoke with agricultors, gardens, and sometimes with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his books.
Then, evening, he drinks "Whiskey and began to write."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only 2006 received the full access as the last erbine, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the officers began to care for the archive, which he was a " hundred years of years, in which the Aristocrates said, "Oh, lead it to the bottoms."
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards, which showed who had something: "Man could say that land conflict would be long-term," says Rhodes, "but there was a birke to fight the two families.
Guys, let all his way go!"
Some of the story in the collection use the city as a point of exit to enter on wide base in the English history, including the Labourer, who follows a man who leaves the new built Burg to accept the building raised from 1381.
"It's a record of a challenge that appears in 1380, in this book with the title 'Knightly families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The building upstairs started in this area and I thought a resurrection was a good beginning.
Maybe both are connected to each other?"
Other story are fixed in the history of the cluster - as the 'The Pharisee', which tells the story of the Jesuit Pater, which the family Darrell hide seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', where the Smuggler Arthur Darrell was shown from the 18th century, who insensed his own beast, filled with stones (a detection made first years later after his sarg was buried).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Loveing family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be nice guarantees, to make sin again and to spend money for things they couldn't help.
Other generations of Darrell-Mans sold their crimes by married rich old women - I propose them to me as a good outside boys, with a talient to deal with heritage."
After the end of his use in the conclusion, Rodes is searching for other unique write experiences
He took a two-week residence in the Finnish Wildness for a Comic Rome on Elemenmaki, the foundation of a sanctory from the past 20th century, which would be required by the nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was threatened to go back," he said.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to be done again with the fucking life."
Launched campaign: Over 300 years old marine capsule in Rhenandorf
With the fulfilment of the 301 years old marine capsule in Rhenandorf, Bad Honnef at Friday started its campaign to introduce a new dachmark (Rundview of Sunday).
To the Sunday, the citizens Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the Slogan secret.
At the end of August, the campaign's high point shall be a festival on the island of Gravenworth.
"That's good for us.
Or?", the master of the action since yesterday on the place in the Roundarfer Capelle.
"We don't really think of it," they write on their free-switch website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make clear that some are better than it seems.
The reason is that we are fully convinced that we know as Bad Honnefer citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
In the action, it's going to be more than "only" a logo and a Slogan.
"It is applied to formulate a only promise, one who contains an unchangeable only arrangements."
Finally, they stand in competition with other communities.
The city Bad Honnef can cost its new dachmarks and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogans fear before the Army
Every year, in Ankara of the Supreme Militarrat (YAS), in Ankara on pensions and promotions in the official corps.
So this week.
On the first view, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish battle forces a year after the puzzle trial.
The meeting had no longer found in the building of the General Tab, as before, but in the office of the President's office.
At the consultations, under the President of the Government Board, the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministry for Protection, Inner, Justice and Excellent Ministry have now participated.
That was the civilists in YAS in the overall number.
The Government attachs the cigarettes in the military.
Generalstab Shef Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the comandaries of the host, the aircraft forces and the sea were attached.
Since the failure Coup, Erdogan's Statute Leader 169 of 326 generals and admireles.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army's rivers - mostly because of active connections to move the exil preacher Fethullah Yellow, the Erdogan sees as the draftsiteer of the puzzle.
For 486 persons that should be directly participated in the putch test will be negotiated since this week in Ankara.
Even on the day after the Putsch Erdogan had mentioned the conversion test as "God's story" because he gave him the opportunity to "clear the battle forces."
But Erdogan really has the army in the Griff?
Finally, February, the magazine "Hurrheid" published a article with the title "Independent in the military headquarters".
In the General Task, it is concerned about a "Islamisation" of the Army, which is, in other words, in the exhibition of the captain contract for soldiers, wrote the magazine.
The great purchase in army and security forces will continue.
Middle July, Erdogan made more 7395 state officers, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan had struck the soldier.
The generals were struck before the real Lords of the country.
Three times they put their role on their role as guaranteers of the world government.
After his election section 2002, Erdogan threatened the power of the military steps to step, not the last call on the reform projects of the European Union.
Ancient officials say that Erdogan's driving islamising the battle forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a noble officier who seeks to persecution in the foreign asil seeks that Turkish arms will be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If it is, this development may not allow Nato's cold.
Unless there is alliancy after the smoking of the use of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capacity are "beauty," says Nato-diplomates.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
It will be given a new U.S. Transport plan to change the rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It is considered to send legal employees to $50,000 per year, more serious provisions for the experience of Visa for a satisfaction of work obligation and restrictions for family-oriented Visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican and supported by the President.
The law design should be discussed in the two rooms of the Congress.
"This law will reduce the poverty, increase the livings and save billion dollars for the tax numbers and will do this by changing the type and way as the citizens from other countries' Green Cards will be distributed."
The law will prevent the catten migration and replace the current system.
This new review process will come to the candidates who speak English who have financial funds to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," says Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to save tracks for rensteigshuttle
In the past months, the future of the railways has been retraced - now it's going very quickly.
Today, before the end of the year, it is to be built at the marotic street on which the tourist areas are driving.
In order to ensure the future of the travelhout, it should be started after the data of the travel minister still in this year.
"When the decision to continue to promote and heal the stretch Ilmenau rate, the country is recognized to this particularly important connection to the tourism," stated the Transport Secretary Klaus Suhl on the free day in Erfurt.
The costs for the establishment of the tracks he paid at about 2,5 million euros.
From this sum, the country takes 75 per cent.
The Treaty on which Shuttle should also be established in the future of the country will be completely declared.
The Ministry and the Souththurgen front as employees have already been one of the technical details.
"Damit is the vehicle plan that treated vehicles and the quality standards," said the shield.
The planned Treaty between the Ministry and the Republic will be closed for a period of eleven years.
This should be established regularly on December 2017.
The shottle of renstring is especially a favorite train connection between the shores Ilmenau and the rent.
In the past months, a pilot operator was explored if the streets of a lot of people are used to re-regulate them in the future.
The stretch is also strong in parts.
The upstairs of sex robots is real, and we should be worried.
In addition, as you thought it could not be crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of the sex robot.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are now a big thing.
Currently, the fundation for responsible robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emergent professor for robotic and artistical intelligence at Sheffield University and with the FRR colleagues, we need to start to take their upstairs seriously.
Klients can choose the color of the robot, its form of browns and the type of fingernail.
"The people are pleasant about them, but the companies give all of them, and we will see them even more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Moderne sex pups have developed from their surfaced partners to robots with a silicon hair that feels serious - with aware of human reactions that will be achieved by the artistic intelligence.
The user can also choose his robots according to his convincements and select all, from the eye of the robator's eyes on the shape of the plants to the type or the color of his fingerprints.
But it will be more vulnerable because many robots have the "personality" that would make a Stepford question progressively.
Moderne sex pups have developed robots with a silicon hair.
The realBotix roboter, for example, allows his users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find in accordance with such quality.
And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which provides the impression of protection and "Wild Wendy" with a "including" person.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that your personality has been adapted as well as possible," the Web site of True Company is comforted.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She has its vows in the day, too, how real people!
She can be threatened, fixed on Conversation, or she can be "in vote"!
There are many surprising aspects in this increase of sex robots - not last because they have replaced real human relations - but the subconstructive low properties, the playing of administers, when you get a step to freegid (named here: contrast), farrah, is a most of them.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"When women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have roxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not only a fishing or holding only another sex game.
Their achievement and their joint raffinship shows something dark and deep in our culture to return from the ideal of the equal rights of the generation to a desire to sex with optional addiction.
Most men will certainly not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices its increased population, they remain still properly on the border of the consumer.
But what is overseered from the border zones, in relation to the spirit of the time we live can be very teaching.
And many people are not surprised or amazing until the free market is available to them.
However, there is a certain surprise that these highly developed sex robots in a time in which women's rights are increasing in the world where there is a president in the white house who has spoken for women to have sexual attacks.
The most scared aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphical images, the broken body and the eye broken, but how really this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a smoking, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a great smoking.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical equality of real women so realistic as technically (as also with pornostar proportions).
They want to feel humanly to follow the movement of a real body.
But, on the point, if it goes about their "persons", the robots don't give real women.
You can't separate you from your partner or just go away.
You don't have an independence or a background story, nothing that means independence or anything that the phantasie could destroy total subjects.
Others expressed: You are happy slaves.
Or to express it in the talks of 2017: Services
Trumps big leisting?
He makes the Middle Romney to include the healthy human understanding.
It has become an essential science of the Trump-Era that the political splits that have polarized the US electorality have also split in small formats.
In the United States magazines with advice on how to interact with the horror of Trump's horror.
We strike all of us in order to put our filter blocks.
Noticed is the power of Trumps to join families.
I remember this because my cousine, a left-oriented girl who lives in Chicago and has been working with the republians in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the units against a common enemy may have a powerful effect.
With the tramp in the white house, everyone who knows, including the Republican community with which she had been fighting for ten years for the political policy, is in the same way.
For the Ethics, it is certainly a good thing, but I am in another connection that this also brings significant risks.
The link was strengthened by Trump, but the final effect of his President has the power to move us to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are considering the amazing opportunity that it will not be abstracted for us any day.
However, there is a more terrible long-term scenario, in the Trump Republican of the right flow "normalised", which appears once in comparison with its standards as the inclusion of consciousness.
I find today a active Nostalgia for the Middle Romney's Urkomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car dack, the 14% income control (but at least we knew how his statement was expressed) - the two in comparison with Trump in the fact was a very small crime.
If the Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican needs to be healthy only to qualify himself as an immediate improvement.
When my cosine was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in the Central Park, the largest of the Carussell of the New Yorker Park Division, and the best three dollars that can go out in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are great, the Fiberglas designs on the center cilindro - all Clowns are slow and the animals are turned out to see full fear of their own shoes - outside windows and the smart music provides this in a wonderful way.
So many clics of a city disappear: The views of high buildings will be age, the Skylines will be trusted to provide a lot of restrictions, and the reality of the city will not be justified to the dream.
Thirty-fifty years later, and I'm not still going over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is not a Swedish Cottage - the Theme-Pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage is not numbered - but a large cross travel in North London.
However, the Central Park Karussell is still a wonderful magic experience, since there are two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and all have a great time.
If I could assess the Karussell, I would have given him the full number of points, but for lucky no one asked.
On the other hand, I was offered in a buying house in this week to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could travel my credit card.
In the coffee house at the edge of my road, it is the same, more the option to compare the assessment with a 15% of drink-- to buy something about the ladentic.
This does not only make surprise of what really should be a neutral exchange, but also uses pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the buyhouse was sorry, while I suffered the experience to rich my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pains from prison in hospital
Pistorius left the prison on the second time for a hospital visit.
In the past year, he was carried out by treatment of snitters to his trading rooms in the hospital, which he gave the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned by murder after a call of the State officer against a first death court.
He killed Steencamp in the early morning hours of the Valentin Day 2013, while he shocked them more times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he had his girlfriend for a neighborhood invoking himself in the cabin.
The State officers have announced their view this time to attach the six-year-year challenges of Pistorius Appell, from which they say that it is too careful.
The National Criminal Defence Authority said that they would be exalted by the Supreme Court of South Africa, and it could be heard in this year.
Pistorius is dangerous that his crime will be increased for 15 years when the state officers are successful.
There's no death attack in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a wonderful bird
At the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-class claims were released from feeds and episodes in the ferries and in the continuing schools.
Three of the solitary schools go to the future to the Gymnasium, four to the real school.
School Leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the citizen house of Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for school disorder, the 29 scholars of the four classs have chosen by the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder a young adler who grows up in the room, but then will be released into freedom.
The muntant chair led a musical with the title "The Adler in the hole".
Bauer Arnold found a wonderful oil, and let it blow it from his hair.
Instead of a shooter kitchen, a small adler came out.
But the hope to make him a hot, the Adler broke his feet on a high mountain, and disappeared.
Then the classs showed three and four in the studio of Yvonne Frank's education.
The hairs danced with the young gockels, the cilindros brought to the wheat.
The Adler stands for the integration, said the school leader Angelika Sitte.
The younger is not different than the other young people, but it is.
But he'll never be like a hungry.
His provision is to be free.
She wanted every fourth class that he felt in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Müller, who continued to enter the training and the parents' representatives.
The time of the kitchen is now completed, explained by the class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She left her scholars after two years, teaching only very low, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they could leave them on the four-class.
At the end, all schools have received a song of solar time and time.
That was a great joy with the children.
The new school year has already been announced eight first-class.
Two Bulgarians set out for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested by illegal campings in Greece, shared the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, quoted by the TV.
On the morning of August 1 in Sithonia, a group of illegal people, including both Bulgarians, was established in Sithonia.
In the same day, they were released while a investigation is currently running.
The Foreign Ministry reported BTV that Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have carried out the controls on the uncountless camps and put everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not considered for this purpose.
The controls are continued during the whole saison.
The Ministry said that the Court could attach a money train.
Software updates for Diel Face: What the concerns now need to know
How exactly does the software update find?
Does thisl favour participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
In thisl Hipfel, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-concern software updates offered around 5,3 million cars.
They should improve the gas treatment of cars of the emission classs of Euro 5 and sharedly improve Euro 6.
Euro-4 disease or worse are excluded from it.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action committed?
No, the issued software updates are free.
"The obligatory updates apply only for vehicles that have smooth software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their exploitation has established the power travel contract (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a positive implementation in the next months, but there is no exact date.
Damler has notified to write every concern.
If without any inspection is accidentally, it will be completed in their framework.
How long should the disasters go to the total of the disasters?
"Shwer to say," says Smetanin.
This declines from the manufacturer's enhancement and political pressure.
"When we have seen, the car generators are freely working at the environment's subject."
How long should the update continue?
The desolation itself could stay at work only three to four hours.
It may be a time-of-defender to get a date.
What do the vehicles who don't travel cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel, and the VW concerts?
The ACE is going to wait.
Probably external manufacturers would follow, so Smethanin.
Is there now a massive price consumption of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But also in the regions where carriers were carried out.
In the rural room, there is no value loss for older Diel.
The ACE is to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J provides Kennedy Center label
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first price distribution under President Trump promised to be political.
One of the priceholders don't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets the first Rapper one of the renamed Kennedy Center.
As the culture sets out on Sunday, there are also Singerin Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), and the Choreographic Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) to the masters.
The indications shall be transmitted in the beginning of December.
Traditionally, the US President Donald Trump will take a reception and participate with his wife Melania in the disaster.
The teacher with the progressive TV series known prices lears already announced the participation in the gala.
The New York Times said, "This Presidency has decided to completely abandon the artists and human rights - even to leave them the mediums - and that's me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stated that they will use the conversation with Trump to explain their views.
The named John F. Kennedy Centre is the largest cultural institution in the United States main town.
For the previous prices, Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's town tree officer, is in Rente the next year.
However, the position is already written - adequate competitors are rar.
Since 31 years, Wacker is a city tree.
And the work still makes him a lot of pleasure, as he spends in the pressing conversation.
He reports a replacement, but also required tasks expecting his followers.
Eventually, he wonders that there is no excuse to fulfil the requirement profile.
The city looks for the next possible time for a architecture or building.
That should be - under consideration of the regular reporting periods - yet enough time for a processing.
Since the Haslach for the Management Community works as the under-governmental Authority, the competent must provide appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city at all cases.
If they are not able to fulfil this more, the citizens should go to the consultation until Offenburg.
But the citizens are close to the city and his own, says Wacker, who reports a good professional climate and a good vote between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, several major projects have been collected to review the warker with honour.
"We make the city life," he is sure about the building and his workers.
But in the future, there are also projects of replacement in the Agenda: the construction of the old Hukla Areals and the low-hopen parkplace is similarly appropried.
The tickets between bollenbach and Steinach are renewed, even the station age is still the subject.
Only the last ones will be shocked by 1,5 million euros in books, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"All at all wait great tasks on my followers.
The work here makes happy."
Gostalterically there is a great room for a city tree tree.
With Haslach’s own Bauhof and Gartneries, many can be directly flexible.
"Man can be moved much," so watcher, and the establishment of the Green Points will be mentioned by citizens and visitors often honourable.
Since the old city is an ensemble under the mental protection, it is important to have a "eye for what is clean", when new buildings are approved, the disease town trees.
Unless the town tree has high responsibility.
He's the Bauer, "and the end runs all over my table."
In respect and coordination, he can count on long-year collaborators: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been ten years ago, Manfred Beener (Tiefbau) has already been 15 years ago.
Even if his follower remains long, Wacker wants to say, "We're looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further establishment of the city.
Whoever wants to build Roland Wacker, after the outcome of the city of Haslach, a complete study as diplomating or Bachelor with the architecture, and there should be a good recognition in the fields of design and design.
The city building includes high- and deep-building, building planning, basic competition issues, administration of cities, citizen officers with buildhouses and town gardens, including the underground authorities.
Travel rate to guides: locked southern tracks
According to the police, the unknown travellers had carried the blue travel rail of the boat transmission in the field of the Leoben Street (B116) to the directions.
These were so strongly disturbed that the following goods should be held.
The travellers go out of two men's tents and look for them since the night hours.
Near the Tatort, the witnesses were observed a rosaard Roller and a travel-rad-factor.
"This is far from a lausbuben stream," said OB-Speaker Christoph Posch to APA.
The one or the tattoo had been carried out in a great danger and was also dangerous to the transport.
Besides the suffering of the location and the shipment, and the expenses and the costs of the shooting transport may also be able to accommodate the penalties of the booters.
It was totally a "realable" sum, said the speaker.
The challenges were replaced on the freetagnach middle day, and the travel transport could be carried out without restrictions.
The ten persons were out of free day, two of them were considered the telecommunication.
They didn't escape, but they had a disappointment.
According to the OBB speakers Christoph Posch, we needed to be exhausted around 200 meters.
Isolators and mass were also wounded.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help IBD (including mark)
Red meat and chocolate can sing for your suffering system like a alptraum.
But a new study is exactly the same part: a disease that is rich on flesh-based proteins and milk products may glue the symptoms of patients with injury diseases.
The inevitable state in the United States, about 1,3 million and 300,000 in the United States, caused magnetic battle and bullshots, reversing or bloody smokes, weight loss and extreme suffering.
While the concerns are usually cutting meat and milk products to lift their symptoms, researchers found in the Washington University that the essential aminoaxian Tripophan of proteins contribute to develop immunities to promote a tolerant darm.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the darm to ensure that the painful microscopes that are hidden in food are not in the body.
Cells that are able to exclude disagreements will be equipped by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without disagreement.
If the equivalent weight is too long in the direction of the disaster, it may result in an increasing income.
In experiments, a type of tolerance for the immune cells in museums that take a certain bacterium into their income.
And the bacterium needs Tryphohan - one of the building stones of protein - to eliminate the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a battery type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the darm-microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
There were more Tryphohan's museum in their food, so they had more of these immunity cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of the Tryphohan's rich food tolerant, less income darmmilieus, if the same system also affects people.
The postdoctorandain Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immuncel that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of studies had such cells, but a different group of the same tribes, but separately understood it was not.
She convinced that the difference with the Darmicrobiums of the mouse - the Community of battery, virus and piles that usually live in the magnetic darm train.
The darms of the mouse were sequenced by DNA and found six battery cards that existed in the mouses with immunity cells, but without them were missing with the mouses.
The museum was in a sterile environment so that they missed a darmicrobium and they did not develop this kind of immunity cells, and they received the L. Reuteri and the Immuncellers.
In order to understand how the battery effects on the immune system, the researchers have grown in a floor and then transmitted small quantities of the flow - without the battery - on unleaven immune cells that were isolated by the mouses.
The immune cells were developed to the tolerant supporting cells.
When the active components were cleaned out of the flow, it appears to be a near product of the Triptophan metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-Milch.
When the researchers doubled the quantity of Tripophan in the board of the mouse, the number of such cells increased about about 50 per cent, but when the cryptography values were half, the number of cells around half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mouse, and that most of us are protecting L. Reuteri in our Magen-Darm Tracks.
It is not known whether Tryphophan neighbour products from L. reuteri develop the cells in people as in museums, but defects in Genesis in relation to the Tripophan were found in people with a single mark.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are controlled on the internal area of the darm.
Potencially high cryptophowers can lead to the extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "Gene".
In Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "Gene", Joseph Mourinho, after the medium field player had his debt against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature started in Dublin, the last forehead game before the EUFA-Super Coup to Real Madrid started at the Sunday, and were impressed in the Holter Role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was excluded from the preparation tower of the Blue Asie and made only 45 minutes that Mourinho added that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League Saison.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready before."
Beside Matic also started Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva City, as Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the saison.
The Independent concluded in this week that Mourinho wanted more three new obligations, but he concluded that the club has already made a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations.
"Three of four to get me thanks to the Treaty," added.
"I will be more happy if they get for me four of the four, but they have given themselves great sorrow."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US fly producer Boeing has drawn the silhouette of a drewliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in Washington, but the design began in Marquette in the US Michigan and went in the form of a Dreamliner over the United States, which are several thousands of kilometres.
The action ended 18 hours and a minute.
On the radio screens it was to be the form of a drewliner.
The whole was an earlier test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such publication before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was drawn in the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: As Sigmar Gabriel was still a SPD-head, social democratic ministers had looked at elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
Only no smoking fire from the party center, just no wind wind from the Bund - so the most important desire of the electoral fighter.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, it has changed the fundamental change.
Seither observed the employees from Willy-Brandt's house with a growing discipline the events in the SPD government cities.
What school has arrived from there since the beginning of the year, it would not have been described with the wind once.
There were depths.
And even after the other.
The contract CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Green, after the surprising end of the red green majority in the low-sheets.
"This shows more: Red Green can't just rule freely," said the CDU General secretary Peter Tauber to the reporting network Germany (RND).
The surprising expenditure of a Green Agreement has struck the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.
Five months before the country's choice, its red green coalition lost their income multiple to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The Green Business Officer Michael Kellner requested the low-shex Green Advisory Agreements every weakness to restore its mandate.
The transaction to the CDU means a clear discharge of the electoral weight.
Every threat must immediately return its mandate," said the contract manager and electoral officers of the Green Workers to the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
"It may not be true," a SPD-volking fighter, when the new job news of the party center is achieved on the free day.
Stephan Weil, President of the SPD-minister of Nedersaches, is following the transition of the Green Secretary-General every weakness to CDU without its own governance.
It is the proceeding height of a total number of large and small crisis in SPD-Land connections.
And nobody knows what's coming next.
The missioners started with the unexpected German disorder at the Saarland Wahl in March.
A blue eye, not anymore, the gifts of his time were disappointed.
After the ground-day choices in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhein Westfales will be all different.
That was also -- and it was clearly worse.
The deadline in Kiel brought the SPD into the tablets, the Düsseldorf-Pleite high the party flood.
In the weeks afterwards, the gifts were rejoiced.
Then, when they had created a new force, the G-20-Gipfel from Hamburg came.
And the next depth came with him.
Civil master Olaf Schulz, the last strong SPD-Landschef, died in the weekend his nimbus, because he sat in the Elbfilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he had been in the Christian communication after that, very wrong everything you could do wrong.
Since school is fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil is still.
According to the VW Abgassers and its role in the Council of Supervisory, the Netherlands Ministry President has already been a longer in the crisis.
Man's reviews were added.
Nevertheless, or maybe that is why, trying for the past weeks, always stronger to put in the contract accents.
The intention of Hannover's previous citizens to build his power in Berlin was not hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to guarantee because they promise a stabilisation of the party.
Now it could be the exact part.
This is because there is no fault in the party-internal amount of the near-sexual reasons.
And Schulz's not anymore.
Once, the benefits are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Their wrath is on the Green, and here, in particular, to the absenced parlamentary.
"It is increasing and democracy, as Mrs. Twesten provides their own carriers interests on the interests of all others," says Mattias Miersch, leader of the party members in the SPD-bandstag Fraction, the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten is not chosen for her person as direct candidate, but on the list of lands of the Netherlands Green in the Parliament, if the subsequent delegation continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returned to her mandate.
Thomas Opermann, leader of the SPD Budstag Fraction, included a "undemocratic Manufer".
"The electoral Wille was clear four years ago: the people have made Stephen Weil to the President of the Ministry," said Opermann, who leads down the SPD as a Spitze Candidat to the Treasury election, the RND.
"Now, the personal carrier thinking of a future CDU agreement the Wayler Result," said Opermann continued.
He asked to explain the backgrounds.
I want to know if there was more or the CDU's subsequent advantages.
Supporters for location care III
Whoever wants to be healthy in the years arrived, the first support of the country can be achieved.
In addition, the citizen manager Albert Schindler and three representatives of the STEG town development on the middle-second in receipts.
At the beginning of the information arrangements, Shindler has reviewed the front.
Since 1991, it was provided in reception areas.
At that time, in the Sanction Area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg has taken two thirds of the Fundsum.
In the Sanction Area II of 2005 to 2016, the committee was still at 60 per cent.
For shinders, the previous sanctions are a "research project" - it is finally important to promote the internal development, and not only to conclude new building areas.
On 4 April, the Government President Karlsruhe has received the information that it will be given a sanitary area III.
The Funds Amount 833 333 euros from the country, the rest of the Community's recommendations.
How is a sanction area now?
You're going to, so shinder, look at where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to health in the planned area.
In the case, the area limits may also be moved again.
The STEG was trained on the Mediterranean Martín Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the 'Social City' programme of the Government Programme 'Social City' in that framework the sanctions would then be carried out.
The inners of the programme are the rehabilitation of inner cities, improvement of residence and work relationships and maintenance and infrastructure.
The measures would be achieved by the object that means by basic steps.
The sanction area would finally be defined as a setup.
The payment period is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, it would only be carried out once, in the framework of the participants in the sanction area, a questionnaire would be fulfilled.
In November or December, the decision shall be adopted in order to begin with sanctions in the next year.
The Peetzmann explained that each community should carry out the investigations concerned.
It is therefore to evaluate and decide when it is healthy and in what area.
It will also be introduced in the basic book for the same basis.
Pietzchmann will come again after receipts and make a picture from the situation, promise them.
Gotzel stated that a major success factor for the project was the cooperation of the participants.
Therefore, it will be given questions that will be sent to the citizens in the next week and will be fulfilled until the end of the sommer.
The yellow question bow is the "Babyd and Basic Bown" where it is in other areas about the construction state and sanction.
In the green question bowl, the "Houstroom and Working Boards", information can be made in size, distribution and inhabitants of a room.
The blue "exploitation bogen" is only fulfilled when business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it is to be considered why the gotzel is not at the same time a full questionnaire is not a request for funding.
Furthermore, rebuilding measures are not able to promote.
Shindler still stated that the distribution of funds after the "Windhundnzip" function - who first comes, is first worthy.
You can't be able to reserve for later.
To conclude, the photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make a "smackful" signation.
British finder sets himself a microchip to come with a manual movement in house and car
A British finder is the first in the country that has been equipped with a microchip to open his household, to enter his office and even to start his car with a manual movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had planted the wind chip between damage and indicators and now offered the service for enterprises and individuals that would simplify their life with the technologies through his BioTeq company.
He was held together with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesis in the Royal Hampshire County hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantation procedure is conducted by medical standards.
The technology is like a cat and dog planted mikrochip and only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the households and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of 300 per shut.
The married father has now built home as well as in his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on stage.
The costs of the white house costs thousands of tax numbers
The decision of the white house to fly a marine smoker to South Lawn for a event that represents the American fulfillment in the last month is costed by the data of the military soldiers who were transferred to the TIME magazine until 24,000 US dollars.
The green-white Sicorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on the boat, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the white house with American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Leaders of the White House have made a round by products from all 50 countries.
In Connecticut, the shooter held near a maine shooter, a firewall car from Wisconsin and a boxer from Mississippi.
The military office of the white house required the presence of the squadrors in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, about 36 hours before the hubschrauber landed on the South Lawn, after the registration of the marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the hubschrauber.
"I just wanted you to know that it is such an incomprehensive event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of HMX-1 at the end of the event of his proposals, the marine commander for airport.
The message showed that the shooter at 17 July against 7:00 tomorrow at the South Lawn for the event at 15:00, and remained so long until the race was dreamed between 18:00 and 21:00 to this evening.
The note adds that if the flight should be exhausted from the white house, it would be required by the limit of the service hours.
The original aircraft was located during the processing in the aircraft, while the security personnel of the unit remained during the time at the airport.
From which the TIME records were available were not clear if the second airport was required.
The Hatch Act proposes contracts to use the national property for political purposes.
Data sections show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could lose the provision.
"A question we've put it was whether it was a loss of the Hatch Act and we were informed that it was not the case," wrote the Commander.
"Speak as if you're closed," the commander answered.
The event "Made in America" was signed by the white house as official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
However, official events have political obstacles.
On the agreement, the President gave an advantage for the reform of health reform in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to ensure government rules.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, of political provisional purposes, is nearly a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are obligated to use them for the travel.
But their use is only for a photo-OP, it is unlikely.
Trump carried out in February a investigation when the president airport was carried out in Melbourne, Florida, Taxi Services, and his Twitter account was full of communications that considered the use of the President's aircraft by its properties.
"The white house is covered by the show "Made In America" - shows products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 applies often training flows in the areas of Washington and South Lawn in order to reach the US Presidents in the white house with precise cententers.
As the trimp started in July on the G20 Gipfel in Germany, HMX-1 led the white house 58 training country.
The airport for the "made in America" event numbered at the training need for the month, an employer said.
The Helikopter units flow in addition to 11 hours at this day for "No President Support Missions".
The white house said that the staff numbers took the charge for none of the other requisitions provided on the event.
One speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved to make the shipping on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain budget designs for the President flights, and it is difficult to recognize exact costs for the event.
According to the US Defence Ministry for the budget year 2017, the DD Restitution for the VH-3D, however, 24,380 USD per airport hours.
The records of the unit describe the airport time for 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The white house argued that the actual costs for the operation of the challenges are lowerly under this Council.
"The costs for the tax numbers on the basis of the assessments for the replacement is most irregular," said Walters.
"This estimates contain personal, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual medium."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the replacement costs for DoD does not include the personal costs, but consider the costs for the products, the maintenance and the contract agreement.
At that time, the parent predictor of the white house, Sean Spiker, defended the use of the shooter for the processing.
"The idea is to present these weeks things that are produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sicorsky and the Bunds State Connecticut are very honourable for them to contribute to our national security, and I'm going out that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think how most of the Americans we are all honourable on the hub-shirts and other military exploitation for such many Americans have worked unfortunately.
Of course, it is acceptable to prevent it."
It wasn't clear if Trump interacted with the hubschrauber when he looked on the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting in the carrier of a firewall car.
In the white house, Trump spoke to the representative of Sikorsky and smiled with the media on his own floor of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of it."
TC BW News before sniffling task
The Spitzener of the Second Tennis Budsliga is attached to the table searchdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss News takes tomorrow from 11 hours in Kiel at the end of the table searchdorfer SV.
Although five parts still makellor Bilanz has yet obtained the Spitze Leader of the Second Tennis Budgetsliga the meaning of reality.
Team Marius Zay has any respect to the host.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar formatation.
I'll find the manner very well at the behind positions."
For class and stability at the searchdorf SV, particularly the imports from the high north are concerned.
"Thre Danish and Fines can even be able to refer to instructions in Davis' Cups.
And they are too strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andrea Göransson (Sweden), Seren and Esben Ollesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This will be as hard for us.
There you need a good portion of luck."
The new manage for the trip in the high north is practically practically.
His debt for blue white could give Maxime January.
While it is not the currently active franzose in the Italian Biella tournier, the Turnier in the Czech Liberec Turnier of Kolar (Czech) comes to its first use in this saison.
The unseen chilene Hans Podlipnik Castillo was yesterday with the White Russ Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tour in Kitzbhel in the Ball.
But he should be in Kiel also like Botic Van de de Zandsculp, Nils Lootsma ( both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two ways on the last Sunday, Mate Valkusz could also retreat the club in the Alster.
For the 18-year-year-old Hungary, who was the number one of the Junior World range list in January 2016, does not fulfill someone from the trainer table around Marius Zay the frame.
How can America scare the OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he set his signature under the law to violate sanctions against Russia.
"In his hate to accept the law," the Congress attached a few "respective rules", added.
Moscow’s reaction was also so serious as expected, and even Brussels smoked against the U.S. Forest.
The draft proposes to address European enterprises that help Russia to build gas pipelines in the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the OMV households, which contribute to the construction of the Russian Eastern Eastern Eastern Season of North Stream 2.
The drugs are violent.
However, it is too early for a evaluation of the consequences, so the official statement of the oil concerns.
In fact, Donald Trump himself needed to raise the sanctions even by executive order for life.
Twelve weapons have him to choose.
"The Press" has seen what the concerts could reject and who could really be aware of him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Paul Escobar, the Cali Cartel is in the Hitler of Netflix in the middle point
Instead of the second staff of Narcos, Paul Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is not longer.
The staffs three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, which first received their first trailer and showed the most badness of the show.
With the third staff, the DEA has addressed its attention to the most rich organization of the world’s drug trade: the Cali Cartell.
Inserted by four powerful patents, they operate "come a Fortune-500 undertakings" only with more State designs and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damien Alcazar) is the leader of the Cartells, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francico Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann), and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the new published trailer, Peter Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type of American and Colombia's persecution authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new Viewers are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will be started on 1 September.
Role Backward: The city provides 46 kitchen help
The city reorganizes the Kita-Mittagstic.
With fixed challenges partners for children and a team assignment.
In the cities of children's days, the hour will be turned back.
On 1 September, the city Krefeld takes the food consumption in the cities of children's days (Kita) to own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, a joint leader in the area of younger help, this is a good new: "We all have very happy."
Buying is continued outside the house: A Caterer takes this job and gives fresh buying.
The city involves 46 children's day-day towns in the Krefield area, in 44 the children have a warm age at the middle time.
In the past year, 2800 children were sitting on the table, and the need was growing up.
"Eating not only children who are considered 45 weeks in the Kita at the middle day," explains pommerancy.
"The offer is also applied in the 35-hour treatment of children until 14 hours."
46 part-time powers have from 1 September: they offer the offered food, fulfill them for salat, raw cost and ost, portion the ball time individually, eat, dream, drink and clean the cuisine.
"The employees are attached to a kit," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups like Seven-grouping institutions - decides on the beginning of the hour number.
"The kitchen holes are now fixed to the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"So they have been attached much stronger and it is to convert more easier and pacegotic concepts."
For it is also: healthy food and cook education.
"The kids need to help prepare food."
The direct connection of the cook force to the team is easy.
And for the children.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who trusts them, and not always changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The smoking of the Kita rooms - even the job of the cuisine forces - will be fulfilled in the future by special cleaning personal.
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also shown the charm that they have made in comparison with their own resources and foreign delivery for the city as the most economic of the pressure.
And that, although 46 part-time powers are reinstalled.
"But these hours fall around 750 people in the area of growth are not so strong in weight," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The African Democracy declines from the political role of women, says UNO
The choices can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the chief of the UNO Mission in Afghanistan on Monday.
Nicholas Haysom, leader of the mission of the United Nations, said that hundreds of women in the Council elections are candidate in the provinces. Three women candidate for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered choices are women.
"The role of women can't be considered," he said in a statement on midnight.
The choices can only be very representative and faithful when women participate unlimited and include in all parts of the election process.
Afghanistan's choices for the Province Council and the President's elections are found on 5 April.
The Talibans have published drugs against a choice process, which are collected with the transition of international battle actions to a rating role.
In this year, the elections will be delivered to the next time to the first time by a democratic election government.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghanian independent election Commission reports that 1,2 million women are registered by 3,6 million choices.
Transformation to TV Jubileum
Without the 110-year existence, the TV boxing is inserted to a small smoking with the coffee and coffee.

GMB Business on investments in the McVitie Fabric in Glasgow
A company wants to provide a long-term obligation to production in its work in Glasgow by managers of the Biscuit-Hesteller McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has increased in the future of investments in Tollcross station.
More than 500 cooperators work in the work that produces near other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in the last years.
He added that cooperators and business representatives would "come first" if they change their activities.
In a letter to the Philippines of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested to "committing that the financing for the modernization of production lines will not be prevented."
The GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can not clarify the general site manager of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcrosss, our members are increasingly.
The family generations have worked here and the work forces have focused strongly on the local community and the Great Space Glasgow, an important salary for human employment in a area with high unemployment and social community.
It is therefore necessary under the perspective of workplaces, loyalty and goodness, and before the background of the brexit, the increased livehold cost and the cronical production revenue, the east end of Glasgow is urgently a flowering present for McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said: "The Philialite at Tollcrosss has received a letter of GMB Scotland last night, and the company will respond directly, since we appreciate the continuous commitment to cooperators and business representatives.

We recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production location full and fully. If we change our operators in the location, the workers and their business representatives will be the first to find it."
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago?
The page of La Liga can take care of Marco Verrattti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be allowed in her persecution of Neymar after she has released an offer from 189 million £ to solve his free-slides, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record?
The sensational approach has held the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than the double of the previous mark, where Paul Pogba returned in the past saison for 89 million £ to Manchester United.
After the end, Neymar is offered to the most popular player of the world and to the most payed professional sports of the world. PSG offers more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is courageous about the kind and way how Neymar has turned out his way outside, although a source near the Catalan conditions is that the club has always given his best way to be careful since his arrival from Saint 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG President three years ago?
As Manchester City 2014 interested on the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each United States who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch a player, then we'll stand on their opposition, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelafi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with themselves, these will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have passed this line, which expressed the Spanish Agreement beginning of this sommer interest in the PSG media field player Marco Verrattti.
The PSG clearly allowed it to the international Italians to decline in any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by disappearing one of their price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspazen report loaded Papst Brother Georg Razinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the crime cases was loaded by Papst Brother Georg Razinger.
This means the author and historical Michael Hesemann.
The conclusion report on the Mission Canal in the Regensburg Domspates is further concerned for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", explained after publishing the German Press Agency, expected by the previous Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapell Master Georg Razinger, the 93-year-year-old brother of the empiricier of Papste Benedikt XVI.
It would serve the view of the Catholic Church very, if the moulers and racingers would express their deep concerns on their own delays or their false evaluation of the events.
The Vatican time of "Osservator Romano" was criticized that the reporting on violence would be measured in the domestic paths with "double measure".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody points out that it handles on "fair and occupied acts" and must be prohibited in the future, but it will be the "Grad Mediterranean Manipulation", so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historical and member of the national Italian Bioetics Commissions.
"The apparentship that the Catholic Church is called as the source of all evil, is already part of the all-day experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it to normally," writes Scarifa.
Pristin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also mentioned in the interview with the Bayerian round function: "Man likes to go to the church and this is a found bird."
Furthermore, however, they said that in their youth's youth's "wheels were a completely normal medium of medium-day" "for fresh children as I was to be ready."
They found it unfair to use today’s measures at the past decades, because the world has changed.
In relation to the reports on the crime cases, the Papst Brother Georg Razinger was often raised.
Full of unrighteousness, my author and historical Michael Hesemann, who, with Razingers, translated my brother's brother in 12 languages.
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "and it was nothing to do with him," he replied the results of the conclusion report.
What is exactly in the 440-page report presented by the jurisdiction of Ulrich Weber by Bistum Regensburg?
Total 547 Regensburger Domspaths between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high placebility" victims of overseers, 67 domespates were sexually missed.
In the conclusion report, Georgi Razinger, which was conducted from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, said: "Accountingly, it is possible that the Master of Domkapell R. is used in many cases of the forms of body and psychic violence.
In addition, at high emotionality, the distress for schools could also be more heavy.
However, in accordance with many other accusers, many victims have considered the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive reminders to him."
In Interview, Hesemann explains why the conclusion report on the Mission Canal in the Regensburg Domspatten Georg Razinger has taken his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-site report on the "Fourfalls of wealth in orders to protect the Regensburg Domspatten" provides a contrary picture of Domkapell Master Georg Razinger.
For a lot of schools, his "humanity".
For others, he also appears as colleriker and perfectionist, which was manufactured by the other, if a domspatz musically did not bring to top-life.
How do you report this conclusion report as his Biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the problem and read all 440 pages long report from before to back, you need to ask further why the name Georg Razinger is exceedingly in it.
He's just eight pages in a time, and he will clearly be free of every thought of the mediterranean or community in the terrible cases of sexual misuse.
In the proposal, the excessives of violence were also occurred outside his efficiency.
However, you can suggest him to find out later or to take the first advantages not seriously enough.
The domspatzengynamium on which he has effected has been exceeded by practically all questions as - so worthy - "resolution", "Himmel" and "best world".
Thus, the wide majority of his schools Georg Razinger describes a very excellent witness, describes him as "warmherzig", "beloved", "apprehensive", "competent" and "compenseful", as extern good teacher, who was regularly gained the boys with kids, Keksen and Bonbons and killed "all the smokes of children."
Only a minority is considered about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already been led to wheat breasts.
That he didn't just shoot with sticks and put the key bind on the ground, but also distributed the hairs and all the fresh boys went to the hairs or ears, he has already given himself, very much, and apologize for that.
Nevertheless, in his respect, it is necessary to say that such methods of exploitation were extended in the questionnical time, the 1960s and the 1970s, with the parents, as well as with teachers.
Do you still know these methods of authentication?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I also lived it in a world school, a State Gymnasium.
Compared with what it is actually in this report, in particular to the illegal sexual misuse and violence on the proposal, the free bagats are free.
It is already asked if it doesn't beyond his knowledge and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. that many media just shoot him.
In Bayer Papst, many who have never understood him are still quiet.
However, the truth is: The report has raised Georg Razinger in every regard!
In the media, in relation to the report, it was very much reported about the issue of misuse in the Regensburg Domspates.
Do Georg Razinger in the conclusion report also put any development or community in view of sexual misuse?
Michael Hesemann: Very clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks is to be convinced to the Dom Capell Master.
Not once the parents were involved.
"I have never believed to talk to my father or my mother about," said a concernful one for others, "I was all very painful."
The real problem in the declaration of sexual misuse was, and most of the victims are weak.
If they don't convince parents and sisters once, they would not be a crowler who would have been a colleague of the killers.
How do the domspazen schools consider the role of racingers in respect of the crime cases?
Michael Hesemann: A questioning student formed it so: "I see... no case he had (Georg Razinger) sincere recognition and could have stopped the same tattoo.
I keep it ... too very absurd to accept that it is calculated to him ... bubs have opened inside or clearer or even more than their parents, Internet leaders, trust teachers etc.
That's what you're talking to him about sex... - unbelievable."
The report is therefore clear to the result: "When he believed in schools and/or their environment, he could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation."
What is sexual misuse, then Georg Ratzinger is to free from every community.
So it can not be suggested to him to stop him or to show him.
Therefore, there is no reason to make his good name in connection with these contrary crimes, as it happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "waltexen" to read at the Regensburgian Domspates.
The previous Dom Capell Leader Georg Razinger will be submitted in the report "Wegviews".
Does he have to live with this proposal?
Michael Hesemann: That's the great problem that all in the report has been dismissed and rejected to a serious message from sexual misuse and violence, and in somewhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger.
However, exactly this is a misuse of the report.
There will be so far distinguished: between the proceeding school and the Gymnasium of the domestic paths, between sexual misuse and violence, and once, we say others.
The report also treats cases from time since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the Chorleiters of the Domspates.
The entire horrible performance periodic, the cases in which the boys of Sadistic teachers were regularly scandined and maledited and understood, all occurred on the proposal in Etterzhouses and piles, where they really had to dominate skandaly conditions.
However, he had nothing to do with them, Master Domkapell Georg Razinger, because he had the boys just faced when they were already on the Domspatzengynamium.
On that way, how most of the witnesses described, the "procedure" table.
It was just happy to have you come and benefited the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different on the domspatzengynamium?
Michael Hesemann: So he has already dominated discipline, but there is no sadstic violence.
It also applies to Georg Razinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "the general humanity of R. is assessed, and therefore, in many cases, even positive reminders to him."
Thus, at least the proposal remains exceedingly.
However, although all efforts could define the report only two time rooms in which it was reported by the conditions on the proposal.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to act, and from the events in a school where he was not active and responsible, (if the witness) would not want to hear anything, and then again for 1993.
Did Georg Razinger lost the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengynamics, which is even played by the report.
In this regard, he says that "and in the proposal, the test trap will continue to be practiced."
With regard to the danger of negative pressure publications, he recommended urgent intrigue.
Of course, it was at a time when legal clarity occurred when the check trains were also prohibited in Bayern.
So they arrived in a legal grau zone, as each of us knows.
It was also hard to consider him where the concerns may have overcome or dramatic and where the allowed limits were actually overpassed.
But you can't say he'd always looked out.
It's just not true.
First in 1980, the trial trap was also officially held in Bayern.
Prestin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said that it was inadequate to use today’s pharmaceutical measures at the period.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We talk historically about the "Fallstrick of the Anachronism", so the danger to assess the past after moral conditions today.
The prince's right there.
But, of course, it is not applied to sexual misuse that was absolutely in all times and not for what in the proposal was broken in the case of advertising and violence to innocent children's souls, that is already exceeding the evil of that time.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally working.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this was nothing to do with him.
His means to discipline and punish, so to go to the hair and ears were wide in the 1970s.
While the body attack was then prohibited, he also was strictly maintained.
What image of his regensburger time has Georg Razinger then returned to the talks with you for the book "My brother of Papa"?
Where's the theme of the trigelstrafe in the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book, it's about his brother Joseph's life, so Papst Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, because the domspats played only a neben-rol.
However, I don't have any reason that he leads a strict regime there.
However, it must also be said: Without this perfectionisme, without the required discipline, it would have been not possible for him to form a Institution of World range, true cultural bodies of Europe and his musical tradition that went twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone you don't make a great song of against the boys now and before every success, even on which area, but always discipline, suffering and self-winding.
What for a man did you live with Georg Razinger in conversation with their book?
Michael Hesemann: By the work in the book and out of this, I really have learned Georg Ratzinger very well and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faithful and heartbreak persons, who can't imagine that he can only do something like a floor.
I regularly agree with how many old domespots still today, 23 years after his emergency, regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and he treated him as a member of his family.
Those who don't forgive him until this day that he was strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most domspaths are grateful to him today because he has reached their life and has brought them the world of music.
And that he always was a good, parent teacher - a strict father, knowing that it could be - but it was also a loving respect for them today, and that they looked at them.
And please, again clearly: all that is intended to him is the methods of creation that were on the day's agenda.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time.
But it's most innocent, a man, just because he's prominent and has another prominent brother to make a median sin box.
There is the evil view that is behind it, only openly.
Because the report that was already published was deleted.
Now it would have been said that a 93-year-old man who has built a great service, without the outside of the Bayers, and maybe yet Germany would have no one to know the Regensburg Domspaths, finally in peace.
