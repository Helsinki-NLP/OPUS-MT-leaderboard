"How do you think he says the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but many women have made it."

But Flake said that he would do this, just understood that the FBI would look at accusations against the candidate for the next week, to what democracy calls from the number of minority.
Flake was convinced partly with his friend, a democratic senator of Chris Quinsham.
After talking to Kunsham and a few senators, Flake decided.
The choice of Flake had power, because it was obviously that in the Republics there would not be voices to ensure the Cavan without investigation.

Premier Ministry Zaeve stated that friendships in NATA were taken the necessary in Macedonia, where disemployment levels are more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the pregnant number will be "for" because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATA," says Zeeve after voting.
He said that the results of that would be "the confirmation of our future."

Have you allowed the way of the document?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad unbelievable language -- the worst language I ever saw."
The work is not a major kingdom.
It's unfortunate to those who express his mind
When Moment's activists in my local party preached for me to punish me, it's usually or was surprise.
Finally, I'm the last in a series of members of a Library Party, which says that we don't welcome -- all of us to express our business.
My colleague on the parliament of Joan Rayan received an analytical turn, because she decided against antisemitism.
In my case, the century discovered me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbine.
The responsibility of the economic policy, the national security, the European, on the ironian, the same questions that Jeremy had not mentioned with the previous leaders.
In the report of meetings, which was actually in the fifth of the East Library Party of Notizen, says, "We want to have these meetings to be local and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the library party just such meetings were at the fifth
I'm sorry, today at most of the meetings of tons are not such and the promise "better, more lower" policies are forgotten longer when it was really ever.
It becomes most clearly that in the library parts the different views are not allowed, and each medium is assessed from that side of view, it's an applied to the partner direction or not.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues with which I thought I shared the same political views began waiting for that I'm going back, and took the positions that I wouldn't remember - in the issues of the National Security or on the only EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't mean what I say -- in social networks, there's a trial in which they're calling to interrupt elections, judgeing the centre policy, saying that I'm no longer in the Lebarist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Actually, I know that I had more happy than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me, as a rule, are political.
I'm a pleasure of the professionalism and the decisions of those colleagues, which each day match with sex or racial events, but they're never infected.
One of the most vulnerable aspects of this political epoch is normalizing the level of reversation.
The last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Lebaristic Party should develop tolerance culture.
The reality is that we are no more organization that is maintained by different views, and with each move of the "insurance" or the change of the party's rules will be already.
During the last two years, I took a lot of answers that called me not to fall by a spirit, not to be so sound, and then everything will be okay with me.
But it's not why I went to the policy.
From the time I joined to Lebarist 32 years ago, as a school school education, employed by the governor Tetcher, because my student in school was justified, I tried to stop the best inheritance services for those who have more needed -- let it be a local resident or a nice minister.
I never had my political views, in that number of the last choices.
No one in the East Note could miss in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current direction.
For those who fighted this move in the fifth, I would like to say that when the country is leaving to Brexit, who's worried by the household, the pregnancy and our party service, I don't understand the desire to marry time and power on my loyalty Leader of the Library party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Moment, it's my choices, or it's a library member, or not: I'm happy of what I'm serving you, and I promise that there's no danger of annulment of the elections will be, and the political objectives will not stop me to act in the interests of all of you.

Iir-Merryce 38 - 17: Unexpectable Ir on the top
Two late trials, perhaps a few said the final result, but, without doubt, Air served triumph in this wonderful pre-league Premer-league Tenent.
Now they define the tourist table, the one side of the ten.
Finally, it was their highest protection, as well as their best chances that made their masters, Trainer Peter died had the full right to be satisfied.
"We still tried our games until this time, and we're still unexpectable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Crete from Melissa said, "Give the appropriate Air, he respected more than we.
The 14-minute test of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frederson Clima, put Ira to the front plan, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, received for Warrios, allowed Melordzue to explore numbers, and Jayson Baggot fell for an unrealised trial.
Climates exceeded the leadership of Air with a tool, before, right in the break, he killed, and then made a solar trial, made 17-5 euros in a break.
But Meledez started a second half, and the trying of Patrick Anderson, converted to Bogota, broke the distance to five points.
Then there was a long time for a serious tragic Ruard Not, which was broken, and after the restart of Air went further through the temptation of Stafard McDawell, realized Climate.
Air, executing the obligations of Captain Blair McFerson, received a yellow card, and again Merryce offered another man to pay with an unrealized test of Bruce Colvin at the end of the moon pressure.
However, the masters returned, and when Struan Hatchinnson got a yellow card for that he killed Climate without a ball from a train line, McFerson grounded behind Era.
Climates realized his trial that he did almost after the restart, after Kyle Row received the battle of David Armstrong in a train and sent the flag of Gregor Henry to the fifth trial of the field.

In all Ballivia, which doesn't have to go out to the sea, memory of a branch line, lost Chile in a cruel conflict because of the resources of the 19th century, still living, as a able to plot again through the silent sea.
These hopes may have been achieved the maximum rate for the past decades, since the Bolivia waits for the decision of the International Court on 1 October after five years of exploitation.
"Ballivia has impuls, the spirit of unit and peace, and, of course, she waits for a stated result," said the Ballivia Diplome Robert Calsadilla.
Many ballies will be watched by the MS decisions on large screens throughout the country, hopeing that the treatment in Gaza after decades of decades injured supports the statement of Ballivia about that Chili has accepted the reputation of ballivia's safe exit to the sea.
Eva Marailles is a chronic president of Ballivia, which is involved with the confronted battle for the review of the next year.
"We're very close to return to the quiet ocean," he struck at the end of the January.
But some analyticals say that the court will take a decision on the use of Ballivia, and it's a little change, even if he's doing it.
The AAN organization based on the Netherlands has no right to decide on the Territory of Chile and stated that it would not be determined by the source of possible conversations.
The decision of the International Court is only six months after the final arguments were considered, to indicate that the case was not compatible, a Clean expert in the international law of Paszara.
And far away not proceeding Ballivia's case, the last four years, perhaps they left her back.
“The current ballivia administration was manipulated by the sea’s access process,” said Sarat.
According to her words, the warrier ritory Marailles hungered the last greenness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after this, the discussion will be very complex.
Since 1962, two countries were not rejected by the messengers.
The President Edward Radrigues Velce, the representative of Ballivia in Gaze, denied the idea that the decision of the court was usually quickly.
The Monday, Ballivia took the "the exclusive possibility of opening a new relationship with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of 139 years of differences with the interview," he said.
Calsadil also denied that Marales was still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America – used the Maritime problem as a political appoundment.
"Balivia never deny his right to access to the sea," he added.
"Startly, it's the possibility of seeing that we need to reach the last."
North Care indicates that nuclear collection doesn't touch until they can trust the United States
Foreign Minister of North Care Ri Jong Ho says that his country will never stop use his nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
The fish went on the Sunday at the General Assembly of AA.
He called the United States to fulfil the promises at the same time in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments come as the United States. Director Mike Pampea, likely is on the border of the update of a nuclear topic diplomate with the North Korean Kim Chinn more than three months after Singapore.
He says that it's an unbelievable sea, that the continuous sanctions and the prevention of the United States against the declaration of the end of the war in Carea have ever put the North on the colon.
Washington's fear of the declaration, if Phoenix first doesn't start a lot of steps on the collection.
And Kim, and the President of the United States, Donald Trump needs the ruling of the second self.
But there's a great scepticism at the same time that the Phoenix's seriously faced to reject the arsenal, which is probably a country, looks like the only way to guarantee his safety.
The campaign plans to visit Phoenix in the next month to prepare to the other "Quim-Tramp".

The Valentino Designers and Thom Browne proposed a lot of non-normal major collections for their SS19 collection, which was expected by Paris Fashion Week.
In this year in Instagram, the popularity of non-practictic capsules, the designers sent their creatures to the sodium.
Valentino's marvelous roof was a famous hair, broken by wide fields, similar to the birds that fulfilled the heads of the models.
Other assessors usually had a large size involving the cuts of hot stones, the hair of the chamber and even the anal, but they were not assigned to keep the head in the skin.
Tim Brown also showed the design of wisdom mass - as a time to Hollywood.
Many of the variety mass were with covered mouths and remembered Hannibal Lecter more than higher mode.
One of them recalled a smoke to plot with torpes and awful akulars, and the other is like a smoke of the marginal conus.

John Edward: Wedding language is a needful use for all the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Shtland, it continues from 2018 with a great result of exploitations that contributes to individual and collective success in sports, artists, musics and others.
More than 300,000 students throughout the entire Shtland, schools, represented by the SCIS schools, are trying to ensure the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students to the highest education, which is chosen by carriers and their places as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and save the individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandel said: “When you talk to the man on the language he understands, it remains in his head.
If you speak to him in his family tongue, it's going to his heart."
It's a clear reminder of what we can't only hope in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams of this year, we see that languages take the first place in the tables of lines with the most highest indicators of independent schools.
In the general number of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the highest mark A.
The data collected in SCIS school schools showed that 72 percent of students have received higher class A in Chinese study, while 72 per cent of those who learned German language, 69 per cent - French language, and 63 per cent of the Spanish language, also achieved the A level.
This shows that non-dependent schools in Shotland support foreign languages as a life-wide important way that, in fact, need children and prayers in the future.
The languages are now selected as the same as the STEM proposals (technology, engineering and mathematics) in scientists and in other places.
The investigation of the Commission on employment and employment in the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that among the reasons that the workers carried out in difficult relationship with the fulfillment of the officers, 17 percent were linked to the inadequate language studies.
That's why more and more languages are needed to prepare young people to the future carrier.
With more perspective workplaces that require language knowledge, these standards are needed in globalised world.
Independently from whoever speaks a profession, when you learn another language, it will be real advantages when you will have such uses in all life.
The possibility of contact with people with other countries to automatically put a multiple person on the first place between competitors.
According to YouGov, in which more than 4000 adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak well in a foreign language to speak, and French was the only language in which two-percents were talking about 15 per cent.
This is why investment in language learning is now important for modern children.
There are many languages, especially in developing countries, give children more chances to find a good job.
Each school in Shotland will be different from the languages in her.
The Sherage School is occupied in more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are the most important for the United Kingdom in view of the future to 2020, such as mandarin or Japan.
Whatever it would be interesting in your child, in independent schools will always be choiced with a few languages with a training complex that is specialists in this range.
Shotland independent schools are trying to ensure the environment of education that will risk children and wear their standards necessary for success, independently from what will be in the future.
Today, it is not possible to deny that in the global work environment languages still have life's important value for the future countries, so it must be shown in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “the new international reports”.
Independent schools will continue to propose this choice, difference and advantage for the Saturday Moon.
It should be done

It's the first of the five planned terms of the Trump for the next week, including breaks in friends, Tennessee and Mississipe.
When a vote is coming to the election to fulfil the Court of High Court, Trump is trying to ensure the support of transitional elections, because the republicans risk to lose control over the Congress when the voices are departed in November.
When begins the Throne tonight in the West Virginia and how to look at it in the Internet?
Today, on Sunday, 29 September 2018, the Trump in Wyling, planned at 7 hours of evening.
You can see the trip in the West Virginia on the Internet bottom in the right office on YouTube.
Trump, faster, in this week, look at the audience of the candidate in the High Court of Breta Cavano, which has problems with the benefits of convincing in sexual affairs with a expected confirmation in Senate for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of these expressions is the help of the Republicans who stand before the election in November.
Thus, the President of Trompa reported that these five exemptions in the next week were invited to “activity of goods and accommodations, because the republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in Senate and Palace of the representatives” – reports Reuters.
“The control on Kangresm is so important for his agenda that the president will go into the maximum possible number of states, as we enter into the range of the two-free company,” stated the agent Reyter's representative of the Trumpa company.
Planned on the Wesbanco Arena Arena in Wylingu, today the action can take a gain from Agao and Pennsylvania and take care of the MS Pitzburgh,”, reported The West Virginia Metro News.

Cook Rayder 2018: United States Command continues to fight to save hopes on life in the Sunday
After three one-second sessions on the sabbath day, it might have been exactly the need for this Coffee Raider.
It's an emphasis that comes, it's a complete sport concept that the player believes, and nothing greater than such competitives.
So where would they say Impuls now?
"They had respect with six points, and now - four, so I think we're going to go through this with a little impulsion," said Jordan, "Speak, spring for a day.
The advertising of Europe, of course, on four points forward, and in the game more twelve.
The Americans, as says Spitch, feel that they're easy to take the wind, and they have something to hope, not at the last, because of the form of Spain and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and everyone can appreciate the three points with four.
Sport was dead from the football to the green and is a example.
These challenges of celebration stood all the sounder in the way, as long as his round, and he struck a solution to play in the math on four fields, when they with Thomas went two to two.
His wrath that allowed them to win in the 15th, was meeting a likely cry, as he tells you that he thinks that the American command is not excluded.
"It's just to be surprised and concerned about your own match," said Spider.
Everyone of these players has already gone.
18 aunts to make a label.
At the last two days, the only players who have received more points than Sport and Thomas, are Francesca Malinar and Tommy Flickwood, the unbelievable story of the Cub Radier.
Great, but beautiful couples in Europe are four of the four and they can't do anything bad.
Malliwood was the only couple that didn't make gods on the Sabbath, on the second half of the day, but they also fled the gods in the morning, at Friday, and on the next half day at the fifth.
It happens, and as their energy, likely to this bullshit and from it, and it confirms that they are players that can win in the Sunday, and there would not be more popular player to close the potential winning in Europe when the sun comes to Le Golf National, than Flickwood or Malinar.
Both requested on the same time.
The conversation about the European glory is permanent.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson made a short job over Sergey Garcia, a hero of the old football when he was in the park with Alex Norren.
The gods and two seconds at the last nine have tried the Spanish and switched him, with which they couldn't go out.
In the Sunday, at least, no one can help you with your lunch.
Through the four balls and fourth balls so interesting to watch along with the combination between the couples, the order they give, the order that they don't do, and how strategies can change in one moment.
Europe was the best command and took a great role in the last day, but on this fourth meeting also showed that the United States' Command tried to fight in which some doubted, especially in States.
Europe goes in the Cuba Rider Final 10-6
Europe will have a good respect in the last day of the Cooke Rider after it comes out of the Saturday Saturday matchs and four bottles with 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspired dut Tommy Flickwood and Francesca Maliner designed to fight with two winds over Tyger Woods to bring out the results to Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Beerna, trying to save the trafies they gathered in Hazelen two years ago, was in the United States inhabitants of the morning, getting a series of 3-1.
U.S. proposed greater cooperation in four balls winning two mates, but they couldn't do more.
To save the trailer, the side of Jim Furick needs eight points of 12 single matches in the Sunday.
Fliftwood is the first European starter, who won four points of the pool, and he and Maliner, who received the name of Molliwood after the sensational exits, - it's only the second couple that won four items for his first four matches in the story of the Cuba Ryder.
By destroying Woods and Patrick Ridge in four bottles, they were wonderfully encouraged to overcome the lost Woods and the American Victor Brison Decamba, 5 and 4.
Woods, who raised himself through two mothers in the Sunday, showed a random smoke, but now he played 19 of 29 times in four balls and four quarters and seven balls.
Justin Rows, relaxed on x's four balls, returned to the partner Henrique Stanson's party in four balls to Paradise 2 & 1 Dothman Johnson and Brooke Cookie - takes one and another place in the world.
Europe had no way, although it was a pleasant day to south from the east of Paris.
On the Sunday, the three-second leader of Jordan Sport and Justin Thomas set a control point for Americans two points.
They made the wind of 2 and 1 over John Ramam and John Pulter from Spain in four balls and returned later to overcome Purera and Rory McCilroy 4 and 3 in four quarters, cutting two details.
Only two times in the Cupca Rayer story the command returned from the deficit of four points that goes alone, although on the side of the owners of Furic needs only to draw to save the traff.
But after the next two days, which were best, the contract on the Sunday looks like if they're all getting.
The North Korea says that no way will be broken in the same way without trust
The Ministry of Foreign Letters of the North Care stated that the Organization of the United Nations continues to attach the sanctions to the United States, and in such conditions the country could not be denied from the nuclear weapons in the same way.
Roy Jun Ho stated on the General Assembly of the World Assembly each year that in the past year, the North Carea adopted “the significant measures of good will”, for example, to stop trying on nuclear and racket parts, the department of the nuclear area of trials and promised not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
“If the United States trust will not be confident in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way to destroy yourself in the same way.”
Notwithstanding that Ri had published the normal north Korean ships on the cooperation of Washington to the "poetage" approach to the denucleation, in which the North Korea was recognized because she took the steps, he stated that he did not deny the same statement of the declaration that he had been done in the past.
Ri was saved by the contemporary statement of Kim Chin Yen and Donald Trumpo on the first in the history of the United States President and the North Korea Leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim had volunteers to work on the way to “the denunciation of the Korean south”, with this Trump promised to give the security of the Security of North Korea.
The North Carey is trying to finish the war in Carea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States said that the Phoenix must first refuse from the nuclear weapons.
Washington was also involved with the call to cancell the severe international sanctions in the front of the North Korea.
“The United States are first attached to the “denuclearization” and increased pressure levels with aid to achieve their purposes in a way of employment, and even against the “reporting of the end of the war”, says Ri.
"The exciting of what sanctions can put us into the colline, -- a unbelievable sea of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions increases our untrustedness."
Ri didn't mention the plans on the second semester between Kim and Trompham, which the manager of the United States marked before this week in the Organization of the United Nations.
Instead of this, the Ministry took attention to three meetings between Kim and the leaders of South Care Moun Jain in the past five months and added: "If the participants of this question on denunciation were the South Korea, not the United States, the denunciation of the Korean sea would not be so thick."
However, the tone of the Research Research was different from the past year when he spoke to the ADN General Assembly, stated that the continent of the United States with the aid racket of the North Korea was unreasonable after the "Mr. President of Mal", Trump called Kima "Rackett" as a Samoman.
In this year, in AAN Trump, which in the past year he grabbed “all to destroy” the North Care, he glorified Kim for his courage in the measures of exploitation, but he said that it would be much to do, and the sanctions must remain in force to the couple until the North Korea is denucleated.
In Sergeant Trump reported that he had no time framework for this, saying, "If this is two years, three years or five months, it doesn't mean."
China and Russia are talking to the A.A. Security stated that the Phinian should be able to achieve the measures adopted.
However, the American Sacretarian, Michael Pampea said to the ADN Security in the fourth century that “the execution of the Safety Safety Sanctions must be active and obligated until we are not sure of the full, final and correct dignition”.
Savet Security has taken the sanctions to the North Care in 2006, trying to stop the financing of nuclear and ballistic racket programs of Phanyana.
The campaign meeted Ri in the Safety Security Halls, and the General Assembly stated that in the next month he visited Phoenix to prepare for the next self.
The campaign visited the North Care three times in this year, but his last travel was not successful.
In the midnight he left Phanian, declaring that the progress of the North Korea arrived for several hours of movement, finished the exhibition that he prevents the requirements “only on the gangsters.”
At the meeting with Munham in this month, the North Carea had to visit the racket installation and nuclear complex when the United States adopted the ‘conform measures’.
Thramp said that, according to Kim, "the agreed measures" he expects, it is a guarantee of safety and the intention of normalization with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
The students of Harvard are going a course on the right relax.
The New Curses of Harvard University in this year must train students more sleep, and my goal is to fight the culture to learn the night with the cave in the hand.
The teacher came to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look right on himself and their health.
Charles Chaseler, Professor of Medicine Snow of Harvard Medical School and the specialist of the officer named Brigam and a woman's shop, developed a course that, in his mind, is the first in his birthday in the United States.
The inspired declaration about the influence of an inevitable sleep to learn, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came to me and said, "Why did I just say this at the last course of teaching?"
" She said no one and never spoke to her about the importance of sleep - it was me surprised," he said the Telegraph.
First in this year, the course made by students, explaining why good dreams are academic and sports, and also improve the general setting.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor in the Harvard Medical School and executing director of the University's Health Service, said that the University decided to introduce a course after he found that students often were dreamed for a week.
Curses longing the hour will include a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of room in the Internet where students press a cube with coffee, branches and books who are talking about the influence of the cafeine and light, and how unfortunate dreams are on sport shows, and at the importance of the standard before sleep.
At the end of the stage, the participants tell how many years dreaming can increase the risk of coordinated approaches, insults, depresions and cracks.
The composer map, with interactive images, calls participants to think about their whole-day life.
"We know that this is immediately not to change the conduct of students.
But we say they have to know the same as everyone knows about the impact of cursing for health, "," added Professor Chaseler.
According to his words, the culture of evening is still existing, adding that modern technology and constantly increased pressure on students is going to dream, which is a greater problem.
“The safe dream of good quality must be a “security of weapons” students to fight stress, disturbation, and warm,” he said, – even to escape the ball, because the dreaming of the brain is still hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Kalifornian student who studys a chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler in the development of the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired to learn all on the campus.
He hopes that the next step will ask all organizations to finish the analytical learning program before pass to the university.
Professor Chaseler recommended students to set the time to know when to sleep, and when they come, reporting the painful "Blue light" approaches, which are exchanged from the screens of monitors and lights, which can modify the matching mode that brings to the problem with a comparison.
"Luingstone" 1:0 "Raynegers": Menga kills Jerrude's hole.
"Rengers" was cutting another paradise when Holly Manggie convinced that Steven Gerard would not get a paradise 1:0 on the Lawingstone.
Ibrax wants to write his first way to triumph with the number 4-1 in February in St. Joonstone, but the command of Henry Hallton is already the second paradise of Jerdo as a manager of 18 games to leave on his side eight points from the Ladbrokes Hearts.
Manga struck for seven minutes to break up, and the command "Rangers", who was threatened with a flat, wasn't seen if he had a paradise.
At the same time, when Reyngers goes down to the sixth place, "Livingstan" was taken on the third place, and afterwards Hibernian stays with the divergence in the bowls.
For Rainsfords, there may be additional problems after the Forward Colum Spence should be driving from the threaten head after the time he had trapped the proposal, cast out of the throne.
Jerry made eight changes of the player, because Ira didn't play in the officer of Cuba Batfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Lewis under the 11 numbers, which allowed to take the point from Hearts for the last week, and was in a pleasure of how they were good at every step to go up to their hosts.
"Rengers" was wounded by the ball, but Livingstan made more trying to kill the ball.
They should have been killed for two minutes, when the first Mangy rolled the ball through Scott Pitman to the road of Alan McGregor, and then the players used this chance.
The successful shooting of Jacobs Caigan struck Craig Hallket, but his partner on the protection of Alan Litho could bring a strong shooter back.
"Rengers" took control, but in the last train of the game more hoped to kill than showing a good game.
Alfred Marras, sure, had to be protected for four hours to the end when he and Steven Lowles stood up on the field, but the judge Steven Tomson didn't take the corners of Colombia.
"Ryngers" was able to shoot on the gate only in the first half game, but the branch of Ibrox Liam Kell had not given Lasan Kulibali and the efficient attack of Ove Ehiri.

Then the cells can see the balls distributed in many rack cells, and then re-income the helpable cells.
The test vacation shows success results for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced a window that helps the immune system to recognize the race cells, saw that the race of shepherds was lost for 18 months.
Method enables the reception of immunity cells in the patient, change them in the lab, so they can see the HER2 box, general for many rake cells, and then be raised again.
This stated Professor Jay Berzoffsky from the National Institute of the United States of Maryland, and our results show that there is a very perspective vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several species of anti-risk cells that are fighting with a ring of small salts, scarlets, easy and stable cups,” says Professor Berosofski.

The King Weest came to the discussion in the support of Tromp, the title of the MAGA, after his appearance in the SNL.
What wasn't good.
In the study during the Sunday Western Sunday, Cane Weest was deceived after his statement, where he bought the United States, President Donald Trump said that he would be welcomed to the second time in 2020.
After the evening of his third song under the name “Gord-Privid”, he was in the chamber "We'll make America again", he went against the democratics and confirmed his support of Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they said, "How can you support the Trump, he is the same roses?"
"Well, if I worry about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL started a shoe with the main role of Matt Daman, where the Hollywood star was able to show Breta Cavano before the Court of the Senat during the view of the case of the sexy town of Christian Blase Ford.
Although the expression was not translated, the words of Westa struck in the frame and were loaded in the social media comics Chris Rock.
I didn't understand whether Rock tried to get out of Westa.
Nevertheless, Wess raised up the public that he had a hard time after the cups.
They've been able to give me for the kitchens.
They said: “Don't get out of here with this cup.
They've been driving on me.
"And then they say I'm in a ill place," he said, as the magazine reports the Washington Examiner.
Weest continued: Do you want to see the blue place? "Working that he's" hoped my Spermen's head, that means he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements at least twice, the CNS representatives had broken a message from Veraith.
Weest was taken as a replacement of the song of Arian Grande, who was a boy, Reper McMiler, died a few days ago.
Weest surprised many songs of I Love It, clothed in Perrier water bottle.
Weest has received support from the Conservative Party Officer of TAPUSA, Canada Terner, who wrote in the Twitter: "Anyway with the most respectful spirits Thank you for support."
But by leaving the tower Caren Hunter wrote that West just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
But I decided no one to recognize any one by buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his “artists” that I believe, accurate, and explanates the idea that causes the pain of my people.
He's free.
Like us, she added.
Before the reper was told in Twitter that he had changed his name, declaring that he was now "officially called Caney West".

HIV / AIDS: China reports new cases to 14%
China reported that the number of citizens who live with HIV and SIDA increased to 14%.
According to the information of the employees of health, more than 820,000 people were in the country.
Only for the second quarter of 2018, about 400,000 new cases were registered.
The overwhelming majority of new cases was transmitted through sex as it was in the past.
The traditional VIH-infection is distributed in some of China's races as a result of a violation through blood transfusion.
“Only the number of people who had HIV infection through transfusion of blood has almost fallen to zero,” stated the Chinese causers to conference in the province of Junan.
However, every year, the number of people who live with HIV and SIDA in China is grown up to 1000,000 people.
The transmission of HIV-infection through sex is the low problem of the LEGBT group of China.
Homosexualism was declared in China in 1997, but discrimination related to the LDBT people was to eat.
Because of the conservative costs in the country, about 70-90% of men who take sex with men, finally marriage with women.
Many diseases are distributed from unsuficient knowledge and sexual contraceptives.
Since 2003, the Government of China's airports is Universal access to HIV in the framework of efforts to resolve this global problem.
Maxine Fowers refuses to lose data, disease and theory of the terms of her parliament workers
U.S. Kangreswoman McSin Fuerce was raised on the Sabbath of Province in that her employee had a personal information on three United States Senators of the United States on the Wikipédia pages.
The Democrat Los Angeles said that the presence was to the participants of the top-right bowl and their websites.
“Mr., foolish, and a lot of crazy faults,” says in the Twitter's statement.
Published information, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the U.S. Sans. Lindsy Grem from South Caroline, Mike Lee and Orin Heatch, both of Jute.
Information, which was unknown person on the Capitalian Court during the audience of the Senatical Commissariat on conviction in sexual issues in the member of the Supreme Court of Breta Kavano, appeared in the Internet in February.
The flight happened a few hours after three senators asked Cavano.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP-source is linked to the office of Woters and has published information to the office of Woters' Commander,” reports Hill.
“It's an uninterrupted confirmation entirely lying and absolutely blameless,” said Foyers.
"The member of my commands, whose data, personal information and security had been composed to the result of these opening and false accusations, and no one has responded to the loss of this information.
This is an unincrementable confirmation is entirely lying and absolutely lying."
The officer of the aircraft was quickly called a crisis in the Internet, in that number, from the old presidency of the White House of Ar Flexher.
"This rejects the wrath," says Fleecher.
It's a witness that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Kanglas.
If anyone condemns what they didn't do, they don't have to worry.
They don't have to lead themselves abortively.
They don't have to put them under the doubts of their conviction.
They must be quiet and happy.
Flexher compared the reaction of Foyers on the critical democratics to the judge Cavano when they convinced them in that they were too resolved during hearing in February.
Amar Navar, a candidate from the Republic party, who is playing and participating in the meetings on the intermediate choices, also published in Twitter.
"It's a resonance when it is found true," he wrote.
In his statement, the Foyers stated that her office warned the competent authorities and the legal bodies of these false statements.
“We guarantee that they will be found,” she continued, “and they understand legal responsibility for all their actions that are educated and dangerous for any of my co-operators.”
Johnny English Strikes Again shoots on the ideal Spider Rouen Atkinson.
Now, the tradition of the BRECSITO's sensor in any new film with the British Eagle, and this looks like it is in the Comedy and the Ex-France Johnie Inglaterra, who has started in 2003 with John Inglaterra and has continued in 2011 under the name "Adrage Johny Ingles".
Can the satellite be able to express how clearly we're looking at talking about new export opportunities?
In all cases, the second time he appeared in the print, uncompetent Johny Ingles got the opportunity to lie over things - his name was more sound than all the comic creatures that he did for no English viewers in the cinematography.
Of course, he's a secret agent who, at least his wisdom's presence on the golmore, received a little similar to Cluzo with Mr. Bian's risks and a little so little guy who brought the only note in Horn's fire on the opening of the Almipia in London in 2012.
First his personal was based on the traveling and international secrets of Atkinson, which sometimes played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There's a few favorite moments that hadn't been before.
I loved Johny Ingles, who is near to the airport, clothed in the middle success, and the smoking of the mouth a little smokes through his smoke.
Dor Atkinson for the theatrical comeds is clearly demonstrated, but the humor feels weak, and so it is particularly wonderful if serious films, such as "Agent 007: Mission is irregular."
Guumar feels like it is not only for adults, but also for children, and even unbelievable accidents of Johnny Inglish is not like the mobile films Atkinson in the person of Bin.
The multi-year-year-old training is serious problems in the United Kingdom.
Cyber Hacker was explored in the super-secret community of British spiones in the United Kingdom, opening the names of all British agents in the places, to disappear a jury agent, that is, in obviously, the small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last step for the premier-minister, which is a horrible and amazing acts that are already cutting from the political unpopulation: Emma Tompson dos everything possible of this town-Teressay-My, but in the scripts there is nothing like this.
Her experts report that, as each real spion will be discovered, she will be able to activate some of those who are already on the pence.
And that means that for John Inglaterra's self is all involved: now he works as a sixth teacher in several challenges and gives teaching how to be unbelievable operators: some good examples here because Inglish suggests the Academy of the music of the school.
Ingles returned to Whitehole for an ex-bring and joined with his old many years' friend Bo, who plays Ben Miler again.
Today, for my marriage, associated with the commander of the underboat, the role of the Vicky Pepperdin did a little wrong.
So Betman and Robin getting terrible wrong things in the secret King's agent, where they work again with the beautiful Woulgai Curlena.
Interestingly, the premier-minister receives a dangerous command of a crismatic technical billion, which indicates that can resolve problems with the Hackers of the United Kingdom: the wicked Jason Voltham, who plays Jack Lassey.
Inglaterra and Bow start their excess from unexpected things: cutting under the office, cutting the French restaurant; creating an aggregate, fighting contrabandists on the battle of the beauty of Volta; Ingles learns a clean analytical because he's trying to use the architecture of virtual reality to recognize the interview of the house of Volta.
All the moments were issued for the last event, but the same nice and smile in which there are a lot of children in the television.
Very good material.
And how with other films about John Inglaterra I couldn't think: can't the British Chinese Industry give Rowan Atkinson's role that really shows his talent?
The Library Party denys that is a plan to pay the British for four days of the week with a payment for five days.
The Working Party of Jeremy Corbine should look at the radio plan when the British work only four days for week, but they pay for five.
As it is reported, the parties want the pre-profit managers to transmit the work results made in the result of the educational intellectual revolution, giving them an additional expensive day.
It was seen that the workers will get a worm from three days of exit, but all will be equal to get the same work.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to the economic party program and plans to promote the country to support workers.
The prophecy agreed to pass for four days of a week as a good way to use the change in economic.
The Sunday Times registry said, “The planned view of actions will be announced until the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but the four-day working week is a idea that corresponds to the views of the party and the general industrial strategy to regulate economics on the use of workers.
The Library Party is not the first one who approvals such ideas, the Green Party promises to provide a four-day work week during the general election company in 2017.
However, the disabilities of the Library Parties are not supported.
The representative of the Leibristic party said, "The fourth-day working week is an objective of non-party policy, and it is not a party.
Concerner John McDonald used a work conference for last week to show his view of socialism revolution in economic.
Mr. McDonald said that he decided to return the authority from the "unlegal directors" and "managers" in the communities.
The plans of the custom conseller also provide that the current water resource actions can not be reached back, because the Lebaristic Government can make the "value" based on the expected destructions.
He also confirmed that it was planning to enter the workshops in the campaign's companies and to create a united own funds to provide 10 per cent of their own own tools to workers who will contain divine holidays to 500 cents of sterlings.
Lindsey Grem, John Kendy told for '60 minutes', that the FBI works with Cavano has to change his medicine.
The FBI surveys of accusation in the court of Breta Cavano rejected the final vote by his election in the Supreme Court at least a week. The question is about whether the office of the Republican senators can support.
In the interview of the office in the Sunday '60 minutes', Scott Peley asked the republics of Johny Candy and Lindsy Greachem about 'Sens', or the FBI can discover everything that can bring to changes.
Candy had been more open than his colleague from the South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to go to the court meeting: I talked with the judge of Cavano.
I called him after this happened, and I asked the reason of conviction, and asked him, "Have you done this?"
He was a decision and a single."
Gregor's challenge, however, seems final.
"I think bret Cavano decided that it would be a skandal offense," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that, Bret decides to deny it," added Gream, referring to the Christian Blasey Ford.
"And all who she calls couldn't believe it.
She's just 36 years old.
I see nothing new."
What is the International festival of citizens and what is done to destroy poverty?
In this Sunday, in New York, the International Festival: an annual musical migration, which has a very amazing structure of officers and artists and my mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Festival of Civility will come on a large ship of the Central Park, where ten thousand people will come to get a soldier from the concert of Jant Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendez, and to learn about the real purpose of the migration – the stop of poverty and speaking to 2030.
The international festival of citizens that occurred in 2012 is the global project against the international propaganist group, who hopes to stop poverty for the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free tolerance (if you don't want to pay VIP-bylet), the visitors have been able to execute a series of tasks or "Replace Action", to be a soldier, to write on the electronic officer of the country, to call any other actions and to increase the knowledge of the purpose of disturbation.
But how success was the civilian festival for 12 years and could he get his goal?
Is it a idea to identify people with a real way to achieve people in the need of active actions, or is it just another case called "cletwism" -- people feel that they do a good way to sign online or send the world?
Since 2011, the Federal organisations claim that more than 19 million of 'actions' of their officers are trying to get different targets.
They say that these actions helped the influence leaders to execute the obligations of the account more than 37 billion dollars, which can take into life more than 2,25 billion people to 2030 billion.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 comments on obligations and stated at the sum of at least than 10 billion dollars who have already been divided or collected.
According to the group's assessment, safe tools have been affected at about 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key obligations include food, partnership with investors and artists based on the United Kingdom, “assistance to children to develop in a full age”, the promise to ensure Ruanda's 35 million dollars to help refugee in the country after reaching more than 4700 people from citizens.
“For support of the Government of British, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can save social injustice in the history,” stated Ambassar Treasy Wolman in London in March 2018.
Furthermore, the group reported that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom, the Government had reported about the financing of the “assistance” project, which had been achieved by 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the party questions on the web, "What can you think we can finish with poverty?"
The Global Festival answered, "This will be a long and hard way, sometimes we will suffer paradise and rule.
But as the great civil rights and moves against the apartment, we will build success, because together we are stronger.

U.S. can use MS for blocks to transfer racial naft and gas exports
“Washington can be returned to the military marine floor to promote the exit of the Russian Energy on the East Market and the Nearby East”, stated the US Rayan Zink, reported by Washington Examiner.
Sink stated that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where she acts on the invitation of the legal government, are a basis for learning new energy markets.
"I believe the reason of their location on the nearest east is that they want to build energy as well as in East Europe and South Europe," he said.
And, likely, there are ways and tools to do with this.
“The United States have the possibility of helping the military-marine floor to ensure the opening of the sea paths, and if they need to organize the blue that their energy may probably not be achieved on the market,” he said.
Sink was called to the members of the medium, organizated by Alians of the energy consumers, a non-conomic group that positions himself as “the voice of energy consumption” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, marking that they were, in fact, the same.
“Economic alternative in Iran and Russia is less compared and replaces the field," he said, "Alongside the country" with an economy that depends on the scattered fields.
These statements appeared when the Administration of Trumpa wants much to increase the export of its natural gas in Europe, replaced by Russia, which is much more dancing for European uses.
For this workers of Trump, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to go out of the "incorrect" Gazeway project "The North Path 2" which, according to Tromp, converted Berlin to the "Palon" Moscow.
Moscow immediately underlined that the gas transport “North Step 2” was 11 million dollars, which was created to reduce an existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
Craml confirms that the hard position of Washington this project takes the beginning of the economic and is an example of unconscious competition.
"I think we have the only view of that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the providers," said the Minister of Energy of Russia Alexander News after meeting the American Energy Minister of the United States Rick Pere in September.
The Americans got an attack in the response from Germany, which reaffirmed their integrity of the project.
The main German organization that represents industriality, the Federation of German professionals (BDI) called the United States to not be attached to the EU's energy policy and the two-side reminders between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third party is involved in our energy facilities," said Dyster Kempf, head of the German Industries (BDI), after the recent meeting between the Constellation of Germany Angela Mercel and the President of the Russian Government of Putin.

On Friday, Warren wrote: "Surely, before the voting of the FBI is needed to be investigated."

“Entusiasm and motivation of democracies will be very large,” stated a new site of Sta Rotenberg, an independent political analysis.
"The people say they're already high, and it's true.
But it may be more higher, especially among women's beauty and young choices from 18 to 29 years, who want and don't love the President, but often do not vote."
Even before the statement of Ford, in which she detailed its condemnation in the Supreme Court of the Sexual Court, analyticals claim that when the Republicans are insured, they may have a powerful challenge in response.
“For the Republic party, it happened a middle," said Michael Still, the oldest of the National Comitate of the Republic Party at the beginning of the last week, along with NBC News.
“The talk is not about the comitat or the final voice, or about Cavano in the past. The talk is about what the republicans had done with it and how they had made it,” notices the new channel Gay Sessel, Director of Priorities, the United States, a group that helps to choose democracies.
However, it seems that the Americans were divided in the question of Ford or Cavano's rights, why a little more than the last.
The new question from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of the republics are sure or not very properly trusted by Ford, but 35 per cent said that it is probably not very sure of Cavano.
In addition to this, 38 percent said that Cavano could or certainly have heard in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the fucking side of the Flake FBR, the Ford is investigated and, at least, another person, Debora Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
In the past week, Ford made a statement under a jury before the June Committe, that Cavano, when he was drinking, was helped her in the 17th-year-old age.
Romillez states that the Condidient in the Supreme Court showed her his genitals on the evening when they learned in Eile in 1980.
The worldwide web source plans to start a new Internet to make Google and Facebook competition
Well, Berners Lee, a worldwide web source, starts the startup that makes Facebook, Amazon and Google competitors.
The last project of Technology Legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the data storeplace and who has the permission to access this information.
In an exklusive interview of Fast Company Berners-Ly, he shot that, by creating Inrupt, he had the meaning of "the domination of the world."
"You have to do this now," he said about the beginning.
"This is historical moment."
The program uses the Solid technology to allow people to create the Internet own data store or POD.
This can contain lists of contacts, mailing lists, calendars, fanatics and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available immediately on one browser simultaneously.
Universality of the personal data store in the Internet is that only the user defines who has access to the type of information.
The company calls it as a "personal mount of potency with information".
As a result of the executive director of John Bruss, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together resources, processes and required instructions to make Solid available everybody.
The company is now with Berners-Lee, Bruss, a safe platform that buyed IBM, a number of developers who work on the project on the contract and the coders.
In the beginning of this week, technological developers in the world can create their own decentralized programs using tools available on Inrupt web site.
Brenners Lee stated that he and his command didn't talk to Facebook and Google about it, entering or not full changes when all their business models are immediately looked on.
We will not ask them to allow them.
In the sabbath publication on the Medium Berners-Ly, the mission of Inrupt wrote that it's a safeguard of commercial energy and ecosystems for the protection of the entirety and the quality of the new network created on Solid.
In 1994 Berners Lee transformed the Internet by creating Consorcium of the World Network in the Massachusetts Technological Institute.
In the last month, Berners Lee was very influenced for the neutrality of the network.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Ly remains founders and directors of the World Network, the Web Fund and the Institut of the Open Data.
"I am very optimistic at least a new network age," added Berners Lee.

The MMA entire night waited to look at Bellator 206, they got a wedding Pepa instead of that
Only imagine you've stayed all night to look at the quiet transfer from Bellator 206, and then you're denied in the view of the main event.
The program from San Hashe was 13 bats, including six on the main map, and they were shown in the right office all night at the British Telephone Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerar Mossie and Rory McDonald were driving to the shoppings, looking at the United Kingdom was just amazing when the program was changed to Pepa's shirt.
Some were crashed after he had spent a slow night, especially waiting for this battle.
One of the bulleters in Twitter called a transaction to children's multiple as a "what's crazy shit."
In response to the translation of Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice-President Bellator of Marketing and Communities said, "It was an inadequate situation and six morning, and it was necessary to turn into a child program."
"Yes, Swinna Pepa."
The President of the Bellator Scott Cooker stated that in the future they will work on the program to calculate British Viewers.
"I think we're increasing the possibility of repeat, though, we can decide this question," said Cocker.
"But now the sixth morning in the Sunday, and we can't decide it until the Sunday, and it's the Sunday for their time.
But we do everything possible.
Trust, when the programs remembered, we received a lot of messages and not all they were worthy.
We tried to resolve the question, thinking that it's a technical error.
But it was a strict situation.
I can imagine that the next time it doesn't happen.
We're going down the number of packs from six to five, as we do it and usually, this time we wanted to order funds, but we've stopped.
It's a beautiful situation."

Michelson, who is not in the form, remains on the lake of safe in the cup of Rayder on the Sunday
The American Phil Michelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47 match in the Rider's cup, but he needs to return the form so that this event doesn't be happy.
Michelson, who will play in this campaign, which is running once in two years, is a record 12 times, the commander of Jim Furrick sat on the board of safe forbels on the Sunday Forbourne.
Instead of being in the center of the event, and he was there often after the command of the United States, the fifth-trainer of the cup divided his days between the work of the black and training, hoped to return into the form.
Even on his carrier he was not the best player, but now the 48-year-old golfist is not the ideal choice for a simple field Le Golf National, where heavy falls inadequate guns.
And if the field is not enough, Michelson in the nine mothers in the Sunday will be fighting against the exact company of British Open Francesca Maliner, who gathered with Tom Flickwood all four matches in this week.
If the Americans who are at four points beginning 12 single matches, start with success, Michelson may be very important.
The Führer made a confidence in this player, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He was full of understanding his role today, throwing me on the bed, grabbed, and said that tomorrow will be ready," said Furyk.
"He's very sure in himself.
He was taken in the glory Hall and gave very much commands in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan him on two matches.
I planned more, but I worked just so we thought to play.
He wants to be on the field, as well as all the others."
Michelson's killing the record Nick Fald for the number of matches in the Rayder's cup, played on Sunday.
It may be the end of the carrier in the Rider Cuba, which never was the same as the achievement of individual games.
In Michelson 18 wind, 20 winds and seven miles, the home of Furyk said that his presence brought the command to use.
"He's amusing, sercatic, with the humor, loves smoking over humans and just a very good man who's good in the command," he explained.
"I think the younger players with pleasure broke his worms, too in this week, and it was good to see.
He gives a command much more than just a game."
The Captain of the European Command Thomas Bearn knows that the great explosion can quickly lose
Thomas Bearn, Captain of the European Command, with an experience, knows that it's a lot of disappeared before the individual games last day on the Rider's cup, can easily disappear.
The Danish player debated in Math 1997 in Walderama, where the European Command under the direction of Seva Ballesterus had five points over the Americans, but he finished the minimum advantage of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You're aware of yourself that we had a great privilege and performance in Walderama, but with difficulty, we had a great reward in Brooklyn where they passed," said Bern after the view of the command of Class of 2018, and at Friday, and yesterday, and we got the numbers 10-6 to Leolf National.
"The story shows me and all the others in the command that it's not yet the end.
Tomorrow, we need to play at all hundreds.
Go out to the field and do everything right.
While the eyes were not found in the table, nothing was finished.
We have a goal, and this is the trying to win this tragedy, just on this, and we're going to get it.
I'm constantly saying that I'm sitting on 12 games from our side, but we're very well understanding that the best games are in the world."
Happy as his player played on a hard field for the golf, Bern added: "I'm never going to overcome myself in this.
Tomorrow, it's gonna be a whole different game.
Tomorrow, they'll be individual games, and it's totally different.
It's just amazing if you're on the field with partners and everything's gonna go well, but if you play one, here your real galphistic balances are corrected.
This is what you need to bring to the players that they must show the best tomorrow.
Now you need to leave the partner that you need to go and show all the best as a individual player."
In the difference of Berna, his partner Jim Furyk hopes the best individual game of his sports than the one they showed in the partners, except Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these matchs last day, playing in a proper command in Brooklyn and playing when Europe had the South in Medine.
"I remember every word of this," he said, "reasoning the question as Ben Cransho, Captain 1999 set his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a fast start you saw in Brooklyn and Medien.
When the speed grows, the biggest press is shown on those who play maths in the middle.
We put the match and set the games as we liked, and you know, we're trying to get a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas got the task to start playing and playing against Rory McCilroy in the main mother, and Paul Casey, Justin Rows, John Ram, Tommy Flickwood and Jan Paulter will play against the major golfists.
"I put my players in that way, because I think I'm closed all," said Bearn about my choice for individual matches.
Starting a new German military ship again
The new WFF Germany had to enter into a war in 2014 to replace old military ships of the cold war, but he appeared not for the next year because of the wrong systems and was constantly increased, by the messages of the local missions.
Reinland-Pfalz, the main ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg's new class, was submitted to the first half of the 2019, as written by the Day Time, quoting the military representative.
The ship was supposed to be in 2014, but the problems occurred after buildings were cutting this ambitious project.
Four military ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which are still appointed in 2007, should be replaced by the old Bremen class fragments.
They will be armed with powerful harmonises, various anti-productor and rackets, as well as some "stells" technology, for example, reduced visibility for radios, infrastructure and acoustic signatures.
In the middle of other important characteristics, the longer periods between the technology, more new fractions can not get into their parts to two years.
However, the restrictions indicate that modern battle ships -- which can allow Germany to demonstrate their power outside the country -- will end up until the end of which they enter into the street, marks the Day Time.
The unfortunate F125 ran into a head in the past year when the German IMF officially refused to take the ship and returned his verification of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
The first vanna Mars floor returned the ship to the ship after the delivery.
For the reasons of return, the German media wrote about the multiple "defects in software security and devices" which make a ship in battle mission.
The ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg were particularly important because they have only 120 matrose -- half of the age of the age of Bremen class.
It also appeared that the ship has a very big care that reduces its productiveness and enhances the possibility of further updates.
“Rheinland-Pfalz” means 7000 tons that two more than the weight of the same class used by Germany in the Second World War.
Except the entire price of the project, including the education of the equipment, is also a problem.
Tsana got 3,1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars), the first desire was 2,2 billion euro.
Problems that are involved with new fragments are particularly important in the light of recent warnings about that the Marine Power of Germany is reduced.
At the beginning of this year, Hans Peter Bartells, captain of the German Parliament, stated that the MFF had the less ships for military missions.
He stated that the problem with sometimes increased because old ships are listed, and the ships are not replaced.
He was worried that no one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg's frags could be able to join to the MFF.
National companies on the memories listed to the secret life of the divine
The new research that is conducted in the Shotland Nagory is intended to find that it is said to use the landshuff in the field of food.
Students hope to find something new in the directions of the uniform aircraft aircraft and helping future actions to save these animals.
The study of the National Fourtain Remembers of Shtland is taken by small people, and also by the long-term storms said Davanton in the Gardens of Inver in Western Ross.
The special write devices will be displaced in the main locations of this location to see the actions of the speaker during the session.
The companies and volanciers will lead mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of all records define the frequency of calls, as well as that says what they do.
The map of life and report will be used to create a detailed picture of these animals in this landscape.
Robert Duar, the National Company of Nature Protection, hopes that the results will show what areas are most important for the people and how they use each of the species.
This information helps us to provide the preferences of creating such living places such as the bottles, and how to support the lakes to live with the diseases and other animals connected to them.
The number of speakers in Shotland and the British have been very reduced for the last century.
They limited buildings and developers work that affect the place of life and destroy them.
Veterinary turbines and lighting can be risked, as well as good sources for much and some chemicals for building materials.
They said not totally blind.
But because of their noble life, the ears of the ear said more hearing than the eyes, when the speaking goes about the smoking.
They use a complex echo technology to find eggs and smoking on the flight path.
The national society responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 760,000 hectares of the country, are very serious.
There are ten scientist experts who are regularly guided research, testing locations of lives and, sometimes, equitative measures.
The organization also created the first and the only Chatland commander of Trive in Dumphrey and Galabye, where eight of the ten-shirts of Shatland.
The manager of David Tompson says that it's the ideal territory for the speakers.
"That's, in Trown, we've just got a great place to say," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place of live.
But we don't know much about those who say, so our job is here and in other moons will help you to understand what they need for the best life."
He underlines the importance of checking on the existence of the divine before leaving the ramp of the damnity, so that you can immediately destroy one seed by killing 400 stakes and young people that brings to the full destruction of the local popularity.
The women are under the hill and they are prohibited to kill, struggle, disappointment or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Faral, the organization employer of the officers in Shotland, calls the community to help in this case.
She says, “We have to know much about our words, and we do not even know how their popularity lives.”
Ranold condemns condemnation, and his jurisdictions are going to fall into the court on the German log
Cristina Ranold called an accusation of him in the "face news", saying that people want to "declare themselves" using his name.
His jurisdictions are going to go to the court at the German record of Der Spiegel, who published these convictions.
Forward of Portugal and Yuventus was convinced to renew the American Catherine Mayorga in the room of the office in Los Vegas in 2009.
Then he would have paid her $375,000 for a silence, written in the Friday of Der Spiegel.
In the video Instagram Live 33, Ranold turned to 142 million of his subscribers for a few hours after the publication of the publication of the publication, called this message "Facebook news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today the message is fake news," said the five-second officer of the golden ball before the camera.
"They want to make an exclamation on my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known, remembering my name, but it's part of my work.
I'm happy and good man," he added with a laugh.
Juridical Ranald's case in court against the registry of Der Spiegel on the questions of the accusations that were called "incorrect notice of the privacy," reports the Reuters agent.
The lawyer Christian Scherz stated that the player would require a consensus for a “moral pain in the sum that corresponds to the difficulty of violation of the rights, and the last years, it may be the most serious violation of personal rights.”
In June 2009, the incident had occurred in the Luxembourg Number of Palms Houston and Casinow in Los Vegas.
By meeting in the night club of Ranold and Mayorgo would have returned to the football number, where he would have increased her anal, as written in documents of the round court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga confirms that after this Ranold, he said, "99 percent" he's a good guy who's punished from the "against percentage".
In the documents, Ranold admitted that they had sex, but on the agreement of the sides.
Myorgo also states that he went to the police and made photographs of disturbations in the spite, but then he looked for a judicial regulation, because she was very afraid of the muscles, and she was disappointed that she was “the publicly brought up.”
The 34-year woman says that now he wants to renew the conviction, because he feels a moral threat for that case.
At the time that Ranold was going to go to the Madrid's "Real" from the Montchister of UNITID, and this year went to the Italian Yuventus, closed a share in 100 million euros.
Breaksite: The British 'forever' is lost' the loss of carbuilders
The United Kingdom “allway disappoints” when he lost the status of the world's automobile manager after Breaks, stated the mini-minister of the business of Greg Clark.
He added that it was “income” to the Toyota UK company for BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reminding, the company would temporarily cut the manufacturer in Bernaston, unless Darby's half.
"We need a reminder," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that it affected the limits of Breaksita's result without reminding could lead to the discharge of the workplaces.
In Bernaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis were carried out about 1500,000 cars from which 90% were exported to other European countries.
“In my view, when the United Kingdom goes out of the U.S. at the end of March, the production on our boat stops,” said Marvin Kuk, Director Toyota in Bernastone.
Other car rental producers in the British have taken the question of how the transfrontal range will be activated when the United Kingdom goes out of the U.S. without remembering. In their midst of Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its min in Oxford a month after Breaks.
The major difference is linked to that the builders say about the risk of the lanching rate in the result of Brexita without a reminder.
The Toyota manufacturer works on the basis of “requirely in the term” when the safe parts are coming every 37 minutes from the manufacturers as well as in the U.S. for cars that are in order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without a reminder, the borders may be disappeared to the time and the unfortunate parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep in Darbie more than a day-day safeguard, stated the company, so the manufacturer stops.
Mr Clark stated that the Plan Checkers' Teresa May of the future relationships with the EES "the fact has been made exactly to exceed these checks on the border".
"We need a reminder, we want to get the best reminder that allows us not only the success of this day but also allow us to use this opportunity," he stated Today on BBC Radio 4.
"Information we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must have the opportunity to continue the work of successful staff."
Toyota company could not report how long it would not work for production, but in the future warning that the added cost was to reduce the competitive capacity of the shipment and bring to the range of workplaces.
Peter Covalers, who works in Bernaston 24 years and is a professional coordinator, said that the professor's members are very concerned: "In my worm, when the workshops are short, they will not be restored.
The President of the Government said, "We have proposed the exact plan of our future relationship with the EU that provides confidence."
White house shows that Tromp meeting with Rosenstein may be raised again
A very important meeting to Donald Trump with the director of the General Prosecutor Roddam Rosenstein may be “in a week still placed” while fighting around the candidate in the Supreme Court of Breta Kavano, stated in the Sunday of the White House.
Rosenstein is looking for the work of the special convict Robert Mueller, who is learning the choice of the Russian election, the relationship with the Turp and the Potencial Disorder of Justice on the side of the president.

But it happens, and I always give the new information."
Some journalists are ready to explore her conference: Sanders didn't lead briffins for prices in White House from 10 September.
When Chris Wallace was leaving the program asked her why.
Sanders said that the reputation of the Brindisians has not been called to adjust the teleporters who are working on the public, and the desire added: "I'm noticed about the fact that they're working on the public."
Then she said that an immediate contact of Tromp and prices would increase.
"The President is going to meet more with the answers of the pressures than any president who had been to him," she added without specific facts, "We learned these numbers."
Britains are happening, reported Sanders, but, "If the price has an opportunity to question the President of the United States, it's much better than to do this through me.
We're trying to do this often, you have seen how we did it in the last few weeks.
The tramp regularly answers questions when the White House leaves or takes part in meetings on the street, or on pre-conferences with high-term hosts.
Press conferences of the own president are very good.
In this week, the president in New York proposed, why, when freely and sometimes, extravagantly appeared before the reporters.

I know that for all of you this is a very bad time.
That's why I want to remember how much I'm the price of each worker, independent of his nationality.
My colleagues from all the EU countries and not only give the cost of experiences and benefits that enhance and enhance the work of the health services, also have no use for patients and communities.
Shetland is your house, and we really want you to stay with us."

And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yes, I'll carry a kid, yes, yes, I'll give my women."
However, the report that was located on Facebook's companies was called a hot discussion on the web.
77,000 views and hundred comments, video reactions were indefinite, many said that it was a terrible small production.

It's a little crazy record, but I liked it.
It's a generic product," she wrote.

That's why we're going to persecute such people," said Mr. Olbens.
For the faster processing of children, the trainers have introduced new rules required by some of them to appear in the court for a month from the date of time, because, by the words of the workers, the standard term was 60 days.
A great number of people to declare the right state of the immigration court will be used video association, not to be in the court of personal.
Those who don't have a basis for help are quickly deported.
According to the words of employees and a message from the source of the system that appeared after the last month than the children remain in disaster, the higher probability of depression or the reputation of the disaster that could bring to the exploitation of the violence or the trial of the escape.
The lawyers say that in the greater situations such as Turnille, these problems are greater powerful because the notes of the child are in a worst state, the most probablely they will be ignored because of the size of the installation.
They add that children's traveling into a town without delivering time for emotional training or to discover with friends can increase the threat with which many and so they have already been cut off.

Since the moment, as Walter Botas on the Sunday warned on the qualification travel of Louis Hamilton, it became aware that the introductions in the Mercedes' command play a lot of role in the honey.
Botas stretched out a good place on the jail and almost left Hamilton on the field, until he protected his place on the first two visions and invited Fell to attack his friend on the command.
The first telephone went to the pit-stap and left Hamilton to fight at the end of the common mass of the robbers, at least this manner had to be resolved.

"When you read about pre-relics and flights, then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Fanstein, is it your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost a document -- "Oh, oh, what?

"I didn't have an accusation of Dr. Ford, I didn't allow her story to escape," said Phinestein, "The Hill."

It happened after the historical meeting of the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Chin Pine in June in Singapore, when they agreed in a general time for working with the purpose to release from the nuclear weapons of Korea.
But on the Sunday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the North Care Roy Jan Ho convinced the American sanctions in the absence of progress since that time.

Nancy Pelozzi called Breta Cavano as a staff, she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
The leader of minority in the room of the representatives of Nancy Pelozzi called a candidate in the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano, and stated that by his temperament he would not come to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in the interview on the Sunday at the festival of the Texas Tribune in the Oast, the Texas State.
"I couldn't have been thinking that if she would have been a woman, she would be called a stereo," said Pelozy about her reaction to Cavano before the Junior Committe Senate in the fourth century.
It was an emotional rebellion in sexual issues to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still shipping.
While Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even crying and couldn't talk when his family and the older school classs were spoken.
In addition, he was explicitly committed democratics in the community, calling the conviction against his “gratetic and organized murder of person”, organized Liberals, which had discovered because Hilar Clinton had played the presidency elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that the expression of Cavano showed that he couldn't work in the Supreme Court, because he was explicitly showing that he was prosperity against democracies.
"I think he himself discovered his statements and the manner he spoke about Clinton and Democratic," she said.
The pilosi warned when she asked whether she would try Cavano's impression when you choose it and if the democracies receive most of the representatives in the Palace.
"I'll say so - if he doesn't say the truth in Kanglas or in the FBI, he should not only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the judgment where he works now," said Pelozie.
At the moment, the Court of the Court of Apelation of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the democratic party of her potencial decisions in Cavano against the law on the available medicine or in the case of Row against Wade, because Cavano is a conservative judge.
At the audience of confirmation on the position of Cavano didn't answer to the question, whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now there is no time for the strict, ineffective persons to work in the court and wait for us the words "what is it wonderful," said Pelozie.
And the woman must take it.
It's a true offensive talk, months and years of anger is just exceeding, and she can't remember it without a slide.
"We weep when we're lying," Mrs. Stayne told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think that it's so worthy."
She continued: “I was very helping a woman who had worked with the director, and she said that when she was hungry, she wept, but worked the technology of the way.
But I'm lying."
And I just continued to talk.
I think it was great."
The slides are partly allowed as the exit of the sum, because they are absolutely wrong understanding.
One of my most brilliant reminders of the first work I was once wept from an unexpected crime, then I was a laughing woman - a striking initiative, which always had been a little smoking -- and throwing me up to the east.
"Don't let you see you in the slides," she said.
"They don't know that you're scared.
They think that you're sorrowful and will be happy that he has shown you."
Patricia Schrodar, at that time the Congressman Democratics from the state of Carolad, worked with Gary Hart in the Presidency company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hant fell on a marriage disease on the egg under the name of Monkey Business and went out of the presidency hook, very disappointed Mrs. Schrodar said that she could also share in the president company.
"It wasn't a very good ideal decision," she laughed to me 30 years later.
“ There were seven other candidates, and I was absolutely unnecessary.
Some named this situation "The Belace and the Seven Green."
Because the company has gone for a long time, she hasn't gone out of instruments, so she said she wouldn't take part in the choice if he's not getting 2 million dollars.
It was a playing situation.
Some of her accommodators who sold a thousand dollars had only $250.
"They mean that I'm going with a wheat?" she thought.
When she said that she wouldn't participate in the election company, she so strongly accompanied emotions -- thanks to people who support her, evil on the system that has so exposed to get money and reached to the candidates, and not to the continents, and the wrath on sex, that she has moved in her dry.
"You could think I've got nervously broken," announced Mrs.
"It was possible to think that my competitive sponsor was a manufacturer of Kleenex.
Sometimes I thought they'd write on my supermovil stone?
"It's her weeping?"
Why the front war between China and the United States may be good for Peking
The first war between China and the U.S. were awful, and because the war was far from the end, in a remote perspective of unbelievableness between countries may be on the use of Peking, speak experts.
The President of the United States Donald Trump striked the first warning at the beginning of this year, in order to include the major export offices of China, including the sun panels, the table and the aluminium.
The most important scale occurred in this week when the new tariffs covered the tariffs in a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion billion billion), actually covering half tariffs in China.
Every time Peking replied the same way, taking up the rates from five to ten per cent in the American office of $60 billion.
China's hosts to the United States are a symmetrical response, and the second on the greater economy is going to go tomorrow or eye.
To force Washington to decline, you need to be impressed in the requirement, but the public shift before the United States is practically inappropriate for the Chinese Leader of Si Zyzinpine.
However, experts say that if Peking uses the situation correctly, the pressure of the U.S. Army can support China, reducing the dependence of these two countries.
“The fact that fast political decisions in Washington or Peking may create conditions that start the restrictive economic event, much more dangerous than the observers thought before,” said Abigail Greys, an investigator who is specialized in Asia, in the new American security centre.
