北朝鮮說 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
北朝鮮外部 minister de la ONG 土曜日 continué sanctions dependant its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would supply its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho 告诉世界体年纪大会 北朝鮮是"有意義的善良的措施" , 比如停止核实测试、分散核测试网站, 并非宣布核武器、核化学技术。
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the U.S.A." he said.

ワシントン也抵抗了 calls to relax tough international sanctions on north Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the " declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.

即使, the tone of Ri's talk was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
今年在联合国, Trump, who last year threatened to " totally destroy" north Korea, 尊敬为金为他勇敢 in taken steps to disarm,但说太多工作依然要做, sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
星期日, Trump說他不有時間 marco 說 "如果它拿兩年、3年或5個月 - 沒關係"
中国/俄罗斯 arguments that the U.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for steps taken.
但是,USA Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 提出 U.N. 保安委員會 十二日 , 說: "Forcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue effectively and without fail until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclearization."
安全 Council has unanimally built sanctions on north Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and balistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly 以后说他会再 visit Pyongyang 到下个月准备为第二个合計。
Pompeo已经来年北朝鮮三次了,但他的最后旅程不好。
佢留下Pyongyang in 7月说, progress was made, 只为北朝鮮在小时内宣布他为做 "加斯斯特-like requests".
北朝鮮宣布了一会见到月这个月, 除非一位混合网站 和一种核 complex if the United States took " correption measures".
他說Kim 跟他說「正确的 measures」 他在找是安全保障保險箱 Trump 請求到星加坡。 移动前向 normalization of relations with Washington.

Johnny English Strikes Again review - subpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spaof
現在是用來找Brexit  significations in any new movie with a British slant and that seems applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy traition franhise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
{\pos(190.402,228.833)}有意思的是我們是国家的新的エクスポート機會嗎?
每度, the pop-yeyed, incompetent incompetent Johnny English has his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signaling more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories.
當然,他是主要保密探員,除了他的奇妙 prétensions à smoothie glamour has a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dolop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire Theme tune on the London 2012 Olympics open ceremony.

我愛Johnny English 接近 egy heliscopter während 穿上了一只中西瓦 شوート  armour and the rotor brades letterly clanging against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comdy is on display, but the humour feels very suspowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film marks like 007 and Mission 自身現在 confidently offer coming as a ingredient.
The humour feels like if it is ticketed at kids rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wacky misdaventures is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the person of Bean.
完美的大 premise现在是、大英里是严重的麻烦。
