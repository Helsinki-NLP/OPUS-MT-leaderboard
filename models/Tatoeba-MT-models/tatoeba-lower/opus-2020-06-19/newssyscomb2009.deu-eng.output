Triumph of the lawspopularists in Austria, total of them are at 29 percent
A sensitive storage of both parties of the previous great coalition and a clear strength of the legal popular parties, after the first previous results, the proposed Parliament's elections from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian Popular Party (PPE), where the position of the previous president Wilhelm Molters is seriously on the kitchen.
In addition, the Wahlleger of the Monday for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Karntner Landesheaptmann Jörg Haider, for a triumphale return to the Treaty Policy.
Following the previous results, the social democracy (SPE) remains 29,8 per cent of the votes in the country, but the last elections in 2006 will lose 5,5 per cent of the votes.
Anyway, it's a bad degree of the OVP, which is about 25,6 per cent of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the Australian neighborhood history, and especially the people party who had requested the previous elections is a real katastrophal result.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP was exposed from the coalition, the people party had a clear proposal before the SPE.
However, the electorers may have confirmed the parties that they have left the Government.
Although in the first reactions on the results, there were speculations about a possible return of the party-present and the previous Viceanist Wilhelm Moltiger.
The supervisor believes that this may be already on an extraordinary meeting of the party's case.
This development probably would be the way to the most probable way out of the election ball, so to renew the great coalition from SPÖ and APP.
In view of the strengthening of both legal popular parties - the freedom (FPÖ) has received properly 18 per cent, the BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - but in the same time the social democracies could be able to repeat when the population party with the popular debates (which the FPÖ was still one, in 2005, they had departed from the BZO) in accordance with a common government, as well as the sanctions of the European Union's foreheads.
On this development, obviously, Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party and go back to Vienna to the Austrian Agreement Policy.
In the European Parliament, the party of the Green, which, however, was able to lose easy losses and was cut down among the Austrian political parties from the third on the fifth place.
No other party has probably been making the four percentages and therefore did not enter the Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India can be buyed
If it is not possible to resolve the problem with the Chinese scientists in India because of the illegal collection of caverns, it may be in view of the Czech Foreign Ministry Karel Blackzenberg to a certain disagreement of the Chess-Indian relations.
This signed the Ministry in New York after the meeting with his Indian Officer Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If it doesn't make sure, then it comes to a certain disaster," he explained, "If it does not matter, then it comes to a certain disaster," he explained a meeting that was located on a technical initiative.
Mukherdshi said after talking, in judicial matters, the executives may only be difficult to arise.
However, he concluded that in the case of Peter Švácha, who was free and received a piece of money to want the Central Government with the local Government in Dardjiling, in which the lawful talk is fulfilled.
"Their problem could be resolved," said the Ministry.
For Emil Kučara, who was judged for three years of freedom trap, it would have been the best view of Mukherdshis if he would go to a higher instance.
He could so ask freedom on counsel and wait for his judgment, as the Ministry.
Blackenberg confirmed that his partner was just exhausted in negotiations.
"He recommends a call to a higher court, then it comes to him a question," said the chief of the Czech Diplomation.
The only way and way, as the Czech Party can enter into all the matter, is to allow the judged "competent legal support", the Indian Ministry.
Likewise, he said that such a help will already be commanded to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest to obtain good contacts with India who have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also give it to it, "The Blackenberg.
In the same time, the Chess Presse Agency CCTK, before his partner, the Czech Republic increased the problem of the Chess Entomology.
"We really keep it for a great mistake to arrest these chechical scientists and advocate," he explained.
An answer to the question, whether he has received the adjustment of the Indian side to consider himself with the matter, which is the Minister.
"I have already been promised a lot of promise," he just constated.
A Czech guides the rings around the seaground
He goes to an electronic card on Australia and the limited sea areas.
However, it doesn't interest him in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is Australia and also with her the limited seaground.
The area is so large as the continent himself," the Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is with the three-hearted partner of the United Nations Division for Sea and Sea.
His boss, the Division Director, the Czech Justice Vaclav Mikulka, follows the explanation and completes it.
Here's nice workshops and weapons.
The sea causes a little known world, which is rich in natural sources.
Here is to find the earthquake, the extensive brain and other non-building raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bring the key for the development of a medicine against the carbon.
A seaground, greater than the fishery country
The passenger States have reported their responsibility today to the new sea areas.
After a United Nations Convention, they will also make their rights to use on which they have joined in Montgo Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is particularly about the area of the continent seller, which often enters a few hundred kilometers away from the floor of a country into the sea.
This country, according to the Convention, has a exclusive response on all sources of the continent seller.
"Simply expressed as a continent skin is considered the part of the sea ground and its soil, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea area.
He exceeds the borders of the Ufer Sea, often the limits of two hundreds of seamills of the exclusive economic area," states Mikulka.
The request proposed by the Commission's relevant country to establish the external limits of the continent currency must be made by a higher scientific and technical documentation, supporting many cost-intensive research and measurements.
It is the result of the preparation work for many years.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission justly and easily technical support.
The Commission has negotiated more than five requests, as well as Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
The three recent countries were successful until now," adds Mikulka.
In an international echo, the success of Australia was shortly increased by the first country of the sea areas.
Nevertheless, New Zealand is also a winter - the exhibition of the sea ground that has been raised to the country last week by the Commission is about 1,6 million square kilometers, so about six times more than the size of the own State.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The wine that allows them in the future from the use of the sea ground will, as they promise, have an unvaluable value.
Moreover, other States will step up their requests.
You can do this for ten years since the moment they ratify the "Account of Montgo Bay".
Where the continental seller ends, the area of the ocean ground, which is called the Convention as "the common inheritance of mankind".
There's no more State in here.
The right to promote in this area is a international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea ground is not gold greenland," means a translation director Mikulka, and adds that "in particular areas are exactly defined and the system is contracted."
Chechens in the Pacific
A part of the sea area is also the Czech Republic today.
She shares him with other states of the Old East Block in the framework of the Common Organization "Interocean metal".
This received 1991 because of the Convention, as well as the investors of several other countries, the status of a "investors" investors.
The organization has the right to promote the area ClarionClipperton in the silent ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to investigate from the investors is a little bigger than the former Chechoslovaquia.
The sea ground is there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seaground.
"Firsts can be in a range of 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetal concretions, containing nickel, buyer, cobalt and Mangan," so another jurist, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Mazedonian cooperator of the Division Rober Sandev brings such concretion as the pattern.
She remembers a small cartoffel or, with something phantasie, the speaking smile who raised the league after the goal to life.
German special forces were in the freedom of steel for location
The Egyptian Government had requested to resolve the church risk help from Germany - the experts came.
When it was serious, the special units were ready, but they did not.
For the circumstances of the liberation 11 in Egypt, European tourists are always known more details.
The saving action was also participated directly after the data of the Defence and the inner Ministry.
However, they were specialists of the contracts, as well as the GSG 9 officers, the shipping staff of the Buddy Police, the Buddy Criminality, and the logistics of the technical assistance work in the place of freedom.
As the speakers of the Ministry in Montgaven continued to communicate, German forces were not required, however, because the guests had launched their prisons and fled when they had recognised signs for a mighty freedom.
The Egyptian Government has adopted the requested assistance from Germany to attach them as support forces.
"This is why it hasn't come happy," said a speaker of the Office Minister.
The traveling group of the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and their eight Egyptian colleagues in South Egypt.
After the execution in a wilderness area in the South Egypt, the ices in the border area were destroyed between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the employees remained unexpected even as the details of freedom or possible payments.
The devices have arrived between the well-behaviour in Kairo.
Steinmeier said that the free ices were in the office of the German message.
In the details of the freedom he didn't express himself.
First in Berlin there was no information when they return to Germany.
According to "Image", the five originators and the special forces shall be carried out with a airbus of the airwater and entered in Germany on Sunday.
US representative house rejects the delivery package
The first room of the U.S. Congress has made 700 billion dollars severe rescue packages for financial markets.
The Dow Jones went out to the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US representative house has rejected the reserve package of the Government for financial markets.
Instead of all the calls of President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be applied to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the officers tried to convince the criteria still by the 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiator, had called the delegates to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for the disputation of something that has not yet been income," he said.
Even during the vote, Down Jones entered more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was concerned about the leader, that the State Safety Package could separate.
He got himself shortly before the end of the vote, to turn back after the knowledge of the shield.
Experts are now calculated with more severe Turbulens on international financial markets.
For an entry into force of the programme, the agreement is required as well as the House of Parliament and the Senate.
Numbers of writers decreasing
It seems to be a good winter for the German travellers:
The use in comparison to the year before is clearly highlighted by the travel exploitation for the next month is clearly increased – for the winter saison even more than 30 per cent.
Nevertheless, hard conjunctioning views remains irresponsable to the department of the Germans of a study.
In the books for Wintersaison, the travel offices described a rate of 31 per cent in the previous year, as the German Traveling Band (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
The research of the Market Research Institute GfK is also proposed for the numbers of letters exhausted for the heatmonate.
Thus, the DDR participated with the driving office for October around 11 per cent in comparison to 2007.
The basis for these results is the numbers of the GfK, which estimates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and has been cut down for the total market.
In this case, the travel books held until the end of August 2008.
The DDR participated with the low dollar course, especially in the United States, because of the weak dollar course.
This is the payment of the book growth around a third party.
In this context, Spain, Turkey and Greece and the household fields are particularly demanded by Germany.
Especially, in the course, President Klaus Laepple explained the DRV.
In view of the increased costs for energy and food here, the costs "for customers are better calculating than in individual organizated origin."
The money could save consumers in other cases by the preliminary book rabatts or all-inclusive offers, explained laepple.
Also, the sommer moonates were very good, so that in the past year, they would be resigned to a replacement place - although according to another study, the number of Germans who take a travel, in comparison to the previous year.
My first time of October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless bedroom, beer from liter corners and promis in Designer Dirndln.
A Wizard Debt.
Susanne cronzucker and I have not a lot of common.
She's blond, television moderatory, and brings a smaller dryl.
I have dark hair, I'm student and my clothes are second hand.
But one thing connects us: about three minutes on the show, the photographs are already shooting on us and shooting the store cards full - very crazy, and that's at my first view.
That's what you're doing.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As Wesn-Touri and in fact, north of the white townquator, the feeling of good in the training until the date was still in the borders.
But only one time at the tersyans, it's half so bad.
Everyone takes Dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks directly or disappointed - everything is totally normal.
Selfish views in the Shokoban City are only my girlfriends.
A munchner makes me notice that I had mistaked the guards: "Left hoast free, Middle Youngfrie, forgive right, smooth behind."
I'll be free of the bed from behind to the left.
"Passt," he said and laughed.
Others make smaller explosions on subtile flower technology and drag the pitched fish, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretchs out the naked front.
The young man with the exhibitionist attivity named Bob, comes from England and visits the first time of October.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after he's finished his first drinking measure.
Just next to one of the hydrogens, of which all thinks he's a trash.
So Bob's one of those "Wildbyslers".
Others do not have the happiness to solve the alcohol in this way.
At the eighth night, healthers run in shoes over the room that need to be careful about the poor clusters.
The hospital officers stayed on the road - always four once smoke a surprised trage of cell to cell.
This works as with most of the Visn searchers: empty, full return.
Whoever is in the Promille-Sarg under the plane, you don't see.
"These are the ones where the guarnier packs," one of the healthers called me to ask and lost in the smoke.
The name of the accident victim known by the police
The name of a 63-year-year-old fuses, who died in the hospital after they arrived in Essex by a vehicle, was known.
Carole Paulson, lived in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was participated at the accident on the Friday day on the Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was brought to Queen's hospital to Romford, but later he died.
A 51-year-old man was determined after the accident because of the conscience of a lot of traveling.
In the meantime, he was released on the cooking.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizonte
A long time before Turkey tried to contribute to the European Union, the European forces were interested in entering the inner country of Turkey.
On the east side of the Bosporus, maybe just 20 steps in Asia, one of the most famous relictors of this successful, cheaper efforts.
Hydarpasha Bahnhof was established by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
It's at least what the travellers tell you.
The building is sitting on the end of the bottom with a turm at every side of the front, and it looks like any provincial German Rathaus.
The stone is threatened.
The entire building is fulfilled
But if you are one time within the volunteer card switch, there is no doubt about the achievement of the proposal, which was the most western access.
The bathroom was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Antolia Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was a speaker in the imperialistic game, had to turn before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and further after what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the imperialistic proposals in Germany were made in the first world war.
His ice branches were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabians.
The relative isolation of its environmental region, produced by the unwindable borders of the cold war, has been disappeared.
The British forces cut out from Egypt and drowned the Turks and their German bands from Palestinian and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Bahnhof.
In 1917, a municipal ship flowed into the air, which the artificial dach was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since it has fallen soon, it has passed away from the history.
Today, however, this ice front, at least symbolic, as a door to Anatolya, and all eastly in order to prevent the extension of the diplomatic horizon of the Tuke.
The Governing Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a full new external policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the reached regions, produced by the borders of the Cald War, has been disappeared.
Now there is an approach policy.
The Turkish Government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian split groups of Hammas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, naturally, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the ecological data of this new external policy, I have established the neighbor in the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the guided external policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Advisory Suat Kiniklioglu.
On the next morning, about a half hours later, after a holiday traveling on the same way of the old world produced in the known documentation "The Night Mail", I came to the Turkish main town, which was considered as a new city, for the new world's proposals, the Osman's past to return to the backs.
However, the ACP, which is known for its islamist roots, represents a paradigma change in the Turkish unit.
This has solved some of the missiles in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main employment of the AKP, a special approved, ultramoderne stone and steel construction, in an developing town, within half completed investment centres and bottoms in which the middle manager was manager, both men and women, tried to conclude the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost every other political party of Europe.
Take it, Krawatte, I'm sure he's even packed a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the external policy of the Party is now to integrate Turkey with their direct neighbor countries.
The Old War was an exception," he told me.
Turkey was separated from her innerland.
Today, she needs to look at the east and the west.
It doesn't beyond one or another.
She had to do both.
"But, sure, Turkish could be sometimes," I asked, "Wells to be decided?"
"Turkey," he said, "I don't want to make this decision."
Then he went out a point, at least every one I said here, at least rutinally said: The relations of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are exactly part of Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With Turkish at the boat, it seems to be the message, in the transmitted meaning, Europe can go in the same field of ice-shirts east Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpasha Bahnhof, after another long-term night without sleep, I thought of these two German governments, Mr. Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen the building of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's emitions in the Middle East may now be parts of Turkey's hands.
And when I waited at the office of the office that should bring me back on the Boss, I remembered that Turkey was called "the crazy man of Europe" in those days.
At least, it seemed not much to be sure that the continent should have a responsibility on this fascinating country.
In mind of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Dead" Handley was responsible for Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music programs for the city, he founded his great youth, Proteus in the next year.
He was thinking for young people to 21 years, but as the core last time in 1979, some of us had been the end of 20 - we refused to leave the core.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological transformator) was for the preparation and ability of the cores, every music that was presented to him to be attacked, unless it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full or entire orchester.
The musical visibility of such a young cross was often amazing, exciting and single, and only thanks to the inspiration of this man and his inspiration for the music that has never been read over years.
How often the death has been able to say "the music to speak for himself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His type of guidator was absolutely clear and clear, but never dominant.
As even the musical level was, he requested a lot more higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If someone would have been shooted to the ritter, Vernon Handley was.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the past 40 years I wrote critics for more than one hundred of his concerts and I can excitely say that I've never been disappointed from a single one - often I have been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that strange combination of size and personal beauty.
He decreed those who, according to his words, just "he went with one or two known shepherds in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "in 1946 he reached the teachings of the economic history in Oxford and received in 1950 a Houble Norman researchstypenium ... during the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctor grade.
This is a conclusion of a author comment in Woodruffs book "Junsides of Nab End", however, it does not mean.
Since 1946 to 1953, he was a dozen of the economic history in the University of Nottingham, and during that time he wrote a doctor work on the British Cauture Industries under the maintenance of Professor J.D. Chambers, which later was published in 1958 as "The British Kautschuk industry".
He was 1950-1951 in the United States in a Houble-Norman Stipenium, and broke the room from 1952 to the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham finally and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to distract this part of his travel.
J. Vicente Resino in the Philological Faculties.
'I recommend the explanation of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black-white, in documentary style are fantastic.
They made me attention to them because of their difficulty and the power that they stretched out how they always face respect with the protogonists.
An explanation that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find magic moments."
The second round of the expensive sale in Honda.
In November, Honda begins with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his proceeding model had a large inner room, this big room lilimousine offers more significantly increased.
It also comes to the technical enemies that can be saved by the farmer travel and benzine.
Changes before the existing revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, eastly seen, the new Jazz shows a similar line to his proceeders, the changes that were taken in this large-limousine are numerous.
Furthermore, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger sizes of the car and the new mechanism should be covered.
However, before starting to analyze the new model, you need to say that this new Jazz has seen six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
Following the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturer, renewed this model for a short time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon, which is its selling on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in this year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, it was sold only in Japan about a million models.
The second paragraph was the old continent, a half million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda trys to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japan's companies sold a total number of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates of 10,000 cars are 17% of the advanced growth on the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold totally 8,000 Jazz models since 2002. These are 6,7% of the total sale in Honda in Spain.
What is the new generation of the model, the leaders of the Philail in Spain are expected to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
In addition, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to overcome the sale in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the market hope to conclude the year with total selling of 20,000 models, which are less than 4 000 car car car cars in 2007, a rate of 16 %.
However, Honda has increased its market share in Spain against the previous year (1,6 %) to 1,8 %.
In the same time, Japan's company hopes to reach 2 % in 2010.
In order to get this part, Honda puts the appearance of a new model.
It is about Insight, a hybridauto with 5 doors and compact size of 4,7 metres, that Japanese company hopes to sell about about 200 000 models per year in the whole world.
Following the market evaluations of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models will be sold in the United States while the rest part is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is considered for the first months of the year, the first time its public presentation will be located in January in Valencia.
In view of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
His length is 3,90 meters (plass 5 centimeters ), its width is 1,69 meters (plass 2 centimeters), and the distance between the easts is 2.50 meters, which brings to accept that he has become greater than 5 centimeters.
The height is not changed and remains 1,52 meters.
In addition to the increase of dimensions, the internal space will also be increased.
This success is one of the new space flexibility program and otherwise, the central position of the treatment boxer, a solution used as well as for Jazz's progressive model.
Also, the capacity of the coffee room that has a system of the double layer is reached to 339 liter, so 19 liters greater than the capacity of the first generation.
It must be indicated that these measures are present in the version of 1,4 litre benzin engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz's coffee area with a 1,2 litre benzin engine 379 liter.
Under other improvements, except additional equipment elements such as leadership or the possibility of panorama window, a better access will be offered to the seats.
The open angle of the hints is 80 degrees, where the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The motors of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his marketing, this small model has 2 executions of benzin engines: 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both variables have the i-VTEC system, which allows low consumption and smaller CO2 exhaustion, has developed an extraordinary technical loss, and also provides a dream-moment rate for the entire driving time.
The first variable with 1,2 liters offers the distribution of 90 PS by 6 000 rotations with maximum rotation of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This benzine engine - the Jazz processing model has 78 PS - has 5,3 litres of benzin consumption and CO2 excess of 125 grams.
In view of the processing engine, which has obtained 83 PS in the previous generation, he is now able to come to 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5,4 litres of benzine consumption and 128 gram CO2 excess.
'Auto-Bien', the collisions disappear
In order to prevent the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has inspired this time by nature, exactly said by the beasts.
The Japanese company has developed a robot that the air is turned back to the swarm treatment of bens and disappears accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for the accident prevention.
The engineers from the Technical Development Center of Nissan Motor Co. developed these small robots in cooperation with research center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renamed University of Tokio (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Leader of Technology PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C provides an extension of the fourth Nisan Security Skyline.
This robot should be concerned that the cars of this mark are in the ability to prevent collisions.
During the air, each bene builds its own, oilform aircraft, which is very similar to the Nisan Security Chain.
However, the most important are the fate nuts of the beach that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions that allow you to fly in their personal airspace without breaking.
In order to explore the perspective of the Rundum, the technology developed the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notes the hints that are located before the BR23C at two to two meters and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a border microprocessor, which is directly translated in the signal for the confusion of the collision.
`In the moment, when it is noted, the small robot will imit the beach flow and immediately change the direction by turning its roads around 90o or more larger angle to deny the collision.
The biggest difference in other favorable systems includes that this challenge manager is absolutely instinctive.
If it is not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to deny the restrictions, "Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leader engineer of this project.
In the difference of a bene, the robot cannot go up or below, but not over; he can only move to two dimensions and to the direction that allows him to turn his roads and not to the unfinite directions and to the infinite ways as it makes the branches.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function near the decreasing and decreasing functions to delay the collisions of the small robots.
This device requires only a couple seconds to process information and to act after these information.
It doesn't need to save the information or the intuitive logic of the charged manufacturers, therefore it can continue to work with only a few thousand KB of the storage space.
It sounds surprised, but it doesn't happen about the GBs and not once about the MB of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce Nissan in the next ten years to the series cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are easier and longer than multifalt of lithium ion bateria.
Another possible application of this technology in the future may be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the target and disappear the restrictions on the way.
She's in the middle before she is loaded with a hypothek.
It must be considered that the United States Financial Ministry, except that there is a sufficient liquidity to help support, but it is not without historic.
Before the crisis and to prevent that the US citizens are developed in Hypotheken history of the potential payment banks were developed a sustainable and informative game for the Internet surgery: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of the bad credit' or the track.
The third aspect of this accommodation and particularly its receipt is to consider two-to three times if it is the moment to ask any credit.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Sure she has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for the teenagers than a place for all overseers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not going to buy a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the income of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its company that this would be the first bank in Japan, the nine billion dollars, and 21% of their capitals would take a renewing that is in a strong case of their office courses.
One week after a provisional unification was published, both banks declared that MUFG 9,9% of Morgan Stanley Stammakten would be sold for a single price of $25,25, which is a total payment of three billion dollars.
The price adopted is at least 19% of the course value of the action of 31 August.
MUFG will invest for additional six billion dollars to the conversionable assets, which will be safe from 10% and will be sold to a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the world business is established on the basis of a unique average price of 29 dollars, so 28% of the current curses.
However, Morgan Stanley's activity was in contrast to 17.00 GMT to 6,79% to 23.07 dollars.
“This strategic connection provides an important opportunity to attach Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a Holding Bank,” states John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand their businesss on new areas, but under the observance of the contract reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also ensures that the current financial crisis moves the greatest name of Wall Street to take a lot of careful treatment than previously.
The modalities proposed in the month show also that the unity was changed during the last day: the last Monday Morgan declared that it would sell to 20% of its action for about 8,5 billion dollars to Japan.
'From a week' in Tokio Toshide Mizuno, Officer of the MUFG, we thought that the participation would be full of stammakten.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and ensure us.'
Based on a similar average price, MUFG is paid for its Morgan Stanley Act 7% under their curses.
And the business will be reduced by at least 20% per action with a reduction of wine.
The entity suggests that MUFG in a year can be converted half of its pre-adhessions in stammakten when the recent announcement is increased in more than 50% of the sale value, so about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the money provided by MUFG will be allowed to use investment opportunities to strengthen their balance and increase their sale.
However, an explanator of the group refused to make more information on the strategic proposals of the two new partners.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should build a payment cost of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained to have his balance since August's end.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their currency course returned around half, while the price for the assurement of payment inability was fast.
This price returned in the month, but remained on a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only `overliving' of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the concurrence of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buying of Merrill Lynch, announced the last week, 15 billion dollars, at the part of Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.

A Egyptian command started the attack on the importers of the eleven tourists and their eight partners who were taken ten days ago.
You're in Kairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptians who were held in prison for 11 days in the wilderness, were healed this Monday afternoon and returned in the Egyptian capital city.
Tomorrow they were delivered from a Egyptian command in Chad.
Seinbar in a good state, the ships at 15.30 p.m. at the board of a special aircraft have obtained the military point al-Maza directly near the international airport of Kairo.
They were directly able to talk with the pressure to the boat of a helicopter in the hospital of Maadi, a foreign quarter of Kairo, to be investigated there.
They rejoiced all 'the best health' and the exporters' were not paid, the Egyptian Turismus Ministry Zoheir Garanna on the roll field.
After she was taken captured on September 19, at a continent Safari at the foot of the mountain Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libyan, the group of the Geslene has always been brought back from 35 unknown exporters from a cover.
It is about 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffers, a border guard and the director of the Agency of Egypt, the representative of Safari.
A Egyptian security responsibility explained that 30 members of the special units, from boat two helicopters, have started the attack at night shortly before the morning department.

Letters - the quiet majority of the culture
A debate on the financing of the culture makes shoes and is a central subject of the current election war.
It's better.
But a area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will arise and pay the rare summs that will provide the small museums, the archives, the archeological explosions or the national historical places that will be provided?
What policy will be worth to remember the agreement Government that it will reveal its thoughts and its cultural significant buildings?
What is it in Quebec, as well as in Canada, there is no right laws that protect our culture effectively?
Do you know that the French government is only 3,5 million euros and only for the restauration of the Chinon's closing in Loiretal?
Our neighbors of America are written in the view of their country that the protection of the culture of the American culture and that this culture must be protected from all citizens, Members and government officers, and in contrast vote.
In Quebec, in the assembly of the history company Quebec, at least 40,000 realms gathered in 211 history companys, try to intensify the story to save the many private archives with a few Greeks and get the archaeological resources.
They are also often the weakness of our cultural beasts that protest with the power of disagreement, when the officers and decisives leave their bulldoers on our old stones and forgotten peace helpers.
When will it give a story and culture?
Benelux Governments of the Fortis Bank
With a part of construction, the Benelux states who have been raised by the US Financial Crisis in Turbulens will have Belgian Fortis Bank under the arms: the three States are available to the bank and security institution, which remains in Hungarian reductions, total 11,2 billion euros.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have considered the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the representative of the competitive authority of the European Commission.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first sacrifice of the international financial market since a year, so that the decisions that are now taken to the bank may have preceding characters.
In the meaning of the decision adopted at Sunday, all three States buy the same parts of the Bank at about 49 per cent.
The Bank will probably sell a part of its participation, all of the insurance activities sold by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The acts of the Fortis have started a lot of taxi in the past week, in the second week help they have already shown serious Christians.
However, the bank with its 85,000 cooperators is too large for a platform.
The value papers of the Institute are covered on the freedom of 12% at a 14-year-year degree.
Since boys are the value of the acts around more than two thirds.
The market value of the group is at 14 billion euros, but it is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion teure American safe Package is the USD 700 billion rate and the insecurity of this caused insurance on the markets is caused by the balance of the Fortis Act.
However, the curses have been easy up on Monday.
At Friday, Philip Dierckx was called a new General Director of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private soldier, but there was no interest in a fair offer.
The Belgian Government was trying to explore - no leader should pay his money, he said.
No panic has been broken under the customers for a long time, and the bank's fills were not shocked.
In Hungary, the Fortis is available on own pilots, but it also calls Leasing companies for her own.
Fuch in the room number
Because of the medicine consumption of a person refuses to conclude a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection persistents fear that the data market may be uncontrolled.
" There are data protection programmes that link the use of medical data in each case to the agreement of the concerns.
These should be independently, and, in addition, let's trust in the fuchs the hills" - the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of transmission data.
Insurances set the payments and payments in the case of disease in dependence on the health state of the customer and should be highly estimated, the ensure will not only be completed.
The customer was sent to a serious investigation before, and the Treaty was completed only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
10 years ago, Dick found a vital method of use: At the identification number of the customer, he relates to the data of the last half years of the apothics, speaking whose preparations were buyed, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and how his health situation is.
For example, if he buys regularly many colesterin medically, he followed that his blood-fett speeds are unreasonable, which would automatically go into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the programme in the environment - some definite even a risk multiplicator, so that the ensure needs to give only the paper cross, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the nights is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraine and hitze controls, but also against depression.
The last is a high-risk factor in the view of the guaranteer, while they are not mentioned before.
For the request and processing of data, their own companies have been formed, asking the patients for its approval before they get the data.
In the meantime, they must do this by law, although the disasters have not been delayed for a long time.
Some companies even process the results of laboratories and connect them to the data on medical consumption, which provides a further exactory picture of the health situation of the patients.
Always more companies have access to data, and the control of their use will be difficult at the same time.
However, there is a own data protection protection for health data, but its effect is only on services in health sector and security.
The law design has already been submitted to the Congress, where the authorities can also control the data processing firms.
Dick Richard sees that it is too little, so he wants to continue to develop his program, so that the data can only be delivered to the understanding of the interests.
Another question is, of course, that the interested person may not be able to submit the access to its data, since the ensure otherwise does not conclude the contract with him.
And so the hairs are just a way to leave the grace of the Fuchs.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India duplicate the trade
Since the European Union and India are both trading partners of the others, this was the main subject near other global problems at the nineth shipping.
Today, the French-India Gipfel is also found in the main discussion of cooperation on the Atomic Energy sector.
However, the European Union recognizes that India is a high-democratic power that should be given more votes and cohesion rights in international issues, and the Member States could not even not agree if they should support the continuous membership of New Delhis in the UNO Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the nine-shirt-shirt meetings in Marseille.
The French President and the present President of the EU, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chefdiplomat Javier Solana adopted the Indian President Manmohan Singh. It has been agreed where the trade is doubled in the next five years.
In view of the fact that the equipment between 2000 and 2007 was increased from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not so environmental.
In this meaning, the 26 existing civil air agreements with India were justified to a agreement, so that the air transport will also be fulfilled in the future.
To 2009, India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promises to decline the package.
The objective is to create a balance in the current unresolved relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number of one Indian, New Delhi is only in the range nine between the EU partners.
The grief has been cut off the global relief.
In addition, the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in relation to the terrorism, were judged both sides on the highest, and also the call of a UNO conference was urged.
The Doha round should also be concluded, both sides in the shield.
The EU stated that it was in its energy and climate programme, which means that the smooth emissions should be increased at least 20% to 2020.
It also agreed to India, as well as the proposal, to close a type of global compromise in the future climate, and to send the gas production to 2050 to 50 per cent.
The price growth in food should also be fighted, therefore, both support the introduction of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Government Board visits today the French capital city where he will sign a agreement on the peaceful use of the atomic energy in a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is also expected to have a proposal for French companies for $20 billion for the construction of atomreactors in India.
The Agreement shall be decided for 15 years according to the Agency's reports.

Retroceed the swallowed small airport of Steve Fosset a year ago
The small airport of Steve Fossett, which was found on 3 September 2007 on a floor over the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
The individual parts were found on a board of 3000 m height, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the United States of California and Nevada.
However, in the aircraft there were no human restrictions.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely convinced the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft was located, where an aircraft was sent out. Now we have the safety that it works about the aircraft with Steve Fossett on the day of his movement."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that there was no human oversight in the airport or near him.
The 63-year billionary was explained in February for death.
The American Agency for Travel Security (Ntsb) offered to know that a few hours after the vision of the airport was sent a manage on which the machine was identified: it is about the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007 after Fosset was started in Yerington in Nevada to a 3-star airport.
Last night, some of the personal areas of Fossett were found by a couple near their house at the mammoth Lakes.
It is about two indications with the name Fossetts, which were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Ilnois, Bargeld and a Jack.
The search for Fossett was given a month after its disappearance.
The billionar had obtained a place in the history through a long consequence of records.
In 2002, he was in the sixth trip, as the first man was to cross the worldball in a huge airball: a two-week, a single airport.
Three years later, he flowed the world into a single air without a cross-border airport.
Under its specific records, there is also a high floor of 15445 m over the others, however, with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publication you don't expect
A Suv, which falls by its original design and the special line execution, the downloading overground and its clear angle from the original schema.
Mercedes-benz has tried to build new atoms with this offroader.
In addition, because of its extraordinary properties, the presentation of Suv Glk will also be inconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-benz.
Thus, the explosion that will be associated with the appearance of the new model, even in a new clothing, is in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new newness in the auto-sektor in the Returned Italy.
A project with a maximum stage, which will be carried out in various stages which will take the central Shopingmeile Milands to Corso Como until 15 November.
The first stage will be presented in form from the presentation of the car, which is distributed by 3D breads near the Corso Como, the whole must travel a special optic: the new suv will appear likely in its nearly real sizes as threedimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear likely from the place where it is drawn.
Then, using the Elumina8-technology of the new glk in different moments, in all its detailed details, to recover it as a whole.
It is sure that the request of Mercedes with this publication is to introduce a new type of author clame in this stereotype field.
But will it be to take the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the triveneto – now they risk stadion prohibition
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for which all Italy is now worried? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy", which have gone back since years of the Italian national community, and they, honestly said, have no serious problems before.
It never came to meet Gegnerian Fans before.
The origin of the group is in the right mile.
The assistants are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Triest and Udine.
In Sofia, there are also other smaller groups from Campaigns and Apollos.
They take the Tricolori, on which the cities of the military towns appear: however, they were removed on the sabbath day to refuse a identification.
Your images are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a real legal racial fansene, the Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans 144 cards were set available for the game: all were issued on names and then easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the viminal: among those riding to Sofia there was no one with a running stadium procedure.
Four fans of the Italian humanity, which had already been carried in this regard, was also rejected by the ticket and the travel to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal waits for the reports of the Police to introduce further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi with a stadium provision of at least five years.
This is an international contract that prohibits access to stages in all Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot into a station.
Good luck.
But now, naturally, there are fears of neighborhoods that could follow more than 150.
"This brand must be exposed immediately, and it doesn't give the possibility of justifying the viminal.
Thus, "the eyes in particular with a view to the game of the national society at Middle Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in Apollo, there is actually a small nuclear of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Observation), the Casms, which are on a part of the air, can be numbered by the secret services that are occupied with the problem of the stadium officer.
"Duce-Duce call and the upper right arm during Mameli's Hymne?
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (perhaps expressed in no joy), which has been a few weeks since the Director of the Osservatorio is on the Viminal (he took the posts of Francesco Taglient and Felice Ferlizzi).
Forward, Mazzilli was the President of Trieste, where a nuclear of the supporter of the 2002 Ultras Italia was founded.
It is true, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but it was doubtless that the behavior of these 150-200 people was a challenge.
"I am not a socialologist – adds the point 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes will be offended in the country of their reality.
Before this group was maintained in the room, but now it must be considered what happened and it will happen.
However, we also talk about the pipes during the Hymne Mamelis: it's not even a penalty, but they allow me, there's a missing...
