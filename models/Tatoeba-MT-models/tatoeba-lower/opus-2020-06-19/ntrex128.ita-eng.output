The members of the Galles Assembly are concerned to "come the figure of Pagaccis"
The co-straining of some members of the Assembly is perceived before the proposal to amend their title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Parliament of the Galles).
This proposal is issued as a result of the programmes to change the name of the Assembly in Parliament of Gales.
The members of the Assembly of the whole political area are concerned that it may sound ridicule.
A member of the Laboratory Partie said that his party is concerned that "he could be replaced with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Galles: In gallese, twp means cretino and pwp means cacca.
A member of the Plaid Assembly stated that the group was not content and suggested alternatives.
A member of the gallesian conservator game said that he was "open" to the change of the name, but he sublined that only a small board step separate MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the W letter in Galesis is published like the English pronounce of Yorkshire of the U letter.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently in the stage of self-security for the introduction of the changes of the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of how the members of the Assembly will certainly be discussed for themselves."
The Law of the Government of the Galles of 2017 has allowed the assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission has published the results of a public consultation on proposals, which has registered a wide support to the possibility of calling the Parliament of Gales.
As regards the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favor of Welsh Parliament or WMP (Mergers of the Gallesia Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater consent in a public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties to get the consensus may be a grateful chapter for President Elin Jones, which should present a legislative proposal on the amendments for a few weeks.
The Law on Reform shall include further amendments to the work of the Assembly, including regulations on the exception of the AMs and the drafting of the committees system.
The AM will receive the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Makedonians are reached to the urin for the reference of the change of the country's name
Today, the voters will decide if they change their country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic".
The population vote was organized in trying to end up a debate in decades with the Greece border, which has a provincie called Macedonia.
It states that the name of its neighborhood represents a revention on its territory and is repeatedly oppressed on its EU and NATO's applications.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a representative of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, stated that it would not be considered the result of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is just the price to pay to the EU and NATO.
The campaigns of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every angle," said Adams.
"Today there's no one of the two."
He explained that the loss of bar was understandable.
"The people of socialization in different ways today," he explained.
"The bars are no more the quarters salotes that people frequencies regularly."
As regards the churches, you're worried that the money devoting from the sale of the country will not be long as the leaders wait, "and before or then they will return where they started."
The churches, added, may be replaced by apartment buildings with condomes full of people who will not help the rest of the room.
"The greatest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings is white," says, "and for this reason they will appreciate the time when these churches will be closed from all because it's less probable that a large part of the people who move in these apartments will become members of these churches."
The churches were built by confratered before Harlem became a black quarter - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initiative of the white methodist congregation was departed in the years ’30.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was buyed by a black congregation with the reverent John Howard Johnson, who led the boxing against the reviewers of the 125a road, one of the main streets for the shopping to Harlem, who refused to assume or promote the color people.
A fire in 1939 was severely destroyed the building, but when the father Johnson's parrocchiers programmed their rebuilding, they also ordered the carillon.
The reverent David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his follower in St. Martin's, called the carillon "the campaigns of the poor."
The expert that sounded the carillon in July called him in different ways: "A Cultural Teacher" and "a non-restitutable history tool."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also underlined that he was treated from the first carillon to the world to be sounded by a color musicist, Dionisio A. Lind, which has passed to a larger carillon in Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What was set in the scene in St. Martin's last months was a complicated track of architectures and businessmen, some presented by the ladies of the church, others from the episcopal dioces.
The parrocchial assembly, the director of the parrocchia, constituted by the lacic leader, wrote to the dioces in July about its concerns about the fact that the dioces "seek to download the costs" on the parrocchial assembly, though this last was not involved in the assumption of architects and enterprises sent by the dioxy.
Some parrocchians have lamented a missing transparency from the dioces.

We also have invested in colleges particularly formats that will be available to offer consultation.
Our marks gamma was developed to respond to every need and the invitator environment and the coming positions make us a interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shoping."

The iconoclassy during the English civil war has not been ordered or conducted by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancient Thomas in the past century.

Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been considered by many, maybe more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of Parliament from external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchie.
The fact that an extremely accurate representation is an object of a history debate in the course.
What is true is that the conflict of half the XVII century has defined the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
His results in the quality of the Lord's Protector must be celebrated and remembered."

More than 20 million people have watched the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have continued to join on six television networks the advanced deposit from the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would happen in the years ’80, Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, the political impasse continues, with the e-mails who interrupt the regular programme for the last week of Friday: an agreement referred to by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake to carry a weekly investigation on the accusation.
Ford informed the Commission's Justice of the Senate that it is a 100% of the fact that Kavanaugh struggled it in a stress and tried to spring it during a party to the top.
Kavanaugh, during a deposit infiamated deposit, stated that it wasn't happening to 100%.
It is likely that more than 20,4 million people indicated by Nisen Venderí have followed the deposit.
The company calculated the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks transmitted, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nisen usually has difficulty to confront the spectaculars who follow the programmes in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that for a football playoff game or for Oscar pressures.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions have maintained the name of Kavanaugh, has guided all networks, with a average of 5,69 million spectators during the hearing of the whole day, reported Nillen.
ABC was the second network with 3,26 million telespectors.
CBS has registered 3,1 million telespectors, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nisen.
The interest has been maintained after hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Vendredi drama.
After the office of the moderate Republic, a statement was released by claiming that it would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was rejected by operators of the CNN and of the CBS Vendredi tomorrow while he was insulted by demonstrators while trying to take a assessant to a hearing of the Commission of Justice.
It was left with the low eyes for several minutes while it was reproved and sent from the live on CNN.
"I'm right here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?
It was told him, "You have the power while most women are inevitable."
Flake stated that his office had released the statement and declared, before the excensor was closed, that would have other things to say during the hearing of the Commission.
All chair networks and emissions have been sent from the life a few hours later, when the Commission has voted to present the name of Kavanaugh at the whole senate for a vote.
But Flake said that it would have done so much with the sure that the FBI would analyze the accusations against the candidate during the next week, as from the request of minority democratic.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and with other senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump started a FBI investigation on accusations against Kavanaugh.

Countries of the police with the Catalan separators at the observance of the anniversary of the vote for independentity
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the Sabbath after the pro-dependence demonstrators had been discovered with the police anti-composite teams and thousands of people were joined to demonstrations of oppositors to remember the first anniversary of the Catalan's vote on the session.

Further collections have occurred during the day with cops who have reached the gangs to maintain the fight.
For several hours, the individual groups of singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" were compared to the uniform demonstrators who cried "Lunga Life to Spain."
The local print reported that fourteen persons have had to receive cure for weaknesses received during the demonstrations.
The high tension remains in the independent region a year after the reference of 1 October, which was considered illegal by the Government of Madrid, but recognized by the Catalan separates.
The electorers voted with a lower majority for independence, although the influence was low, and the catalysts against the session had largely touched the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have reported worse last year after the police had been trying to stop with violence against the referendum that had been carried out in the entire region.
Independent groups had been accompanied in Friday night to prevent a national policy support.

"The last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is locked," he explained.

Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanism who registered with his phone the police protection, stated that the conflict was nutrited by the policies of the two factors.
"The situation is always more thirst," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison in waiting for a process since the end of the last year, announced that the European Parliament's elections will be carried on the next year.

Menga attacks the victory of Livingston to 1-0 against the Rangers
The first Dolly Menga gol with Livingston has sealed the victory
Livingston has already left the Rangers to repeat Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as director of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Menga Golf has done the difference while Gary Holt team has passed to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team therefore remains without a victory outside home in the Premiership this stage and will have to face the first in classified Hearts, from which they separate 8 points.
June, the Rangers have visited Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
At the same time, Livingston continues his series of victories in the division staying up for six games, with the coach Holt who must still see a loss since she replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston spreads opportunities against little incisive hospitals
Holt's team should have been properly benefited before the goal, with their immediateness that caused Ranger many problems.
Scott Robinson has cut down but has moved his action before the door's spectrum and Alan Lithgow has only been able to cast out the door after he was inserted to meet Craig Halckett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The hospitals agreed to leave the Rangers playing before them, knowing that they could have able to make the visitors with plastic cups.
And it was so that the crucial gol was realized.
The Rangers have given a penalty calcium and Livingston has found a opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson have been able to go to Menga, which could sign from the center of the area.
At that time, the Rangers had dominated in the possession of ball, but the defense of the hospital team was immediately demonstrated and Liam Kelly's port did not have to worry too much,
This scheme has been maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos has committed Kelly in a stop.
Scott Pittman has seen his gol temptation stopped from the feet of the Rangers Alan McGregor and Lithgow have made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The cross has succeeded in Livingston's area and have continued neutralised, while two requests of rigor, after Halkett's contrast with the Replacement Glenn Middleton and one of the manufacturers were refused.
A "fenomenal" prestation from Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland to Tony Macronoi Arena
A prestation and a fenomenal result for Livingston.
Before the last player, they have been exceptional, continued to overcome the expectations long as this exceptional treatment.
Their game style and collaborators have been changed less from their return to the maximum series, but it must be very credited to Holt for the way he knew to spring the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, on the head of a officerly organized defense, while Menga has set in trouble Connor Goldson and Joe Worrll during the whole game.
Rangers, however, were little inspired.
Although the best offers in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they have been well under these standards.
It is missing the last pass - only one time they have been able to penetrate in the adversary area - and you can consider an alarm campaign for the Rangers, which are in half classical.

The Uranor Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with unexpected inundations (which can benefit the areas cold by sickness)
It's amazing that a tropical depression attacks Arizona, but it's exactly what's probably happening at the beginning of the next week when the last energy of the Rosa urgent will pass through the south-west of the wilderness, creation of unobvious inundations risks.
The National Weather Service has already released awards from unexpected inundations for lunch and marched in West Arizona until South and East Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is predicted that Rosa will lead directly on Phoenix March, approaching himself on Monday with pigs.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix has communicated in a twitter that only "the ten tropical circles have maintained the status of tropical or tropical depression over 200 thousand from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an uragane in about 40 miles from the border of Arizona."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Uranians prevent precipitations between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated pieces to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest area, including the central rocks and the Great Basin will receive from 2,5 to 5 cm precipitations, with small isolated to 10 cm.
For foreign areas to the risk of unexpected inondations, the rain driving by Rosa may be a blessing because the region is struck by sackness.
Although inunds constitutes a very serious problem, the part of these precipitations will probably be positive because the South-West area is currently through a period of security.
According to the Security Monitor Centre, a few more than 40% of the Arizona is through a extreme security period, the second maximum category," reported weather.com.
Initially, the path of the Rosa organ will be quiet to the earth through the Penisola of the Battle California of Mexico.
Rosa, who continued to keep the force of uragani tomorrow morning with 20 to a maximum speed of 85 miles to hour, is located at 385 miles to south of Ponta Eugenia, in Mexico, and has gone to the north to 12 miles to hour.
The tempest will be discovered with the most freshest waters of the Pacific, so losing power.
So it prevents that it will come to Mexico with tropical tempest force in the midnight or in the evening of Monday.
Precipities on the parts of Mexico may be intense, creating a high risk of inondation.
"There are predicted precipities between 7,5 cm and 15 cm from the Battle California to the northwest zone of Sonra, with a maximum of 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa therefore will lead to the north through the Mexico as tropical tempest before the border of Arizona arrived in the first hour of March's morning with tropical depression, so that he goes through Arizona and the South Utah in the evening of Martedì.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or its stress are intense precipities in Basja California, North-West Area of Sonra and South-West-West Area," reported the National Centre for Uranians.
It is prevented that these pigs can generate unexpected inondations potentially leading and flushes of detrite in the wilderness, except on the mountain grounds.

The United States should double the finances for the AIA
While China is always more active in the artificial intelligence sector, the United States should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, the IA Kai-Fu Lee's investigator and operator, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various United States government groups in respect of the AIA, although in the United States a formal IA strategy is generally missing.
In the meantime, China has submitted its programme last year: it is like to be the country No. 1 in IA innovation within 2030.
"It would be a good beginning considered that all other countries are very far from the United States and we need a new revolution in the IA," said Lee.
The duplication of finances may be doubled by the possibilities that the next big success in the AIA sector is obtained in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC during a visit this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month from the editor's home Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the main IA companys in China, Face++.
In the years ‘80, Carnegie Mellon University worked in a IA system that struck the American player of Otello with the maximum pointing and successfully was guided by Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Section of Google.
Lee reminded the previous U.S. Government's previous technological conventions as the Advanced Research Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it will be the next, to identify new visions.
Researchers in the United States often have to work much to get funds from the government, he stated Lee.
"It's not the Chinese who carries the leaders into academic environment, they are the multinational," said Lee.
In the last years, Facebook, Google and other technological society have made lighters from university to work for IA projects.
Lee stated that amendments to the immigration policy could help the United States to move their efforts in IA.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to the dothrandi in IA," he explained.
The Council of China has published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of the Natural Sciences of China provides funds to those who work in academic institutions, as the National Foundation for sciences and other governmental organizations distribute funds to the United States researchers, the bad quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Defence Department has created a conjunctional Centre for the artificial intelligence, the view to involve industrial and university partners and the White House has announced the training of a special Commission for the artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion dollars in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, more than 100 million dollars per year in research on the AIA.
At the same time, the United States order on the creation of a national security Commission on the artificial intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Makedonians vote in a reference for the change of the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted to the Sunday referendum on the possible change of the country's name in the "Republic of Macedonia in the north of Macedonia", a move that would resolve the long-term debate with Greece that has blocked its requests of accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a provincies called Macedonia, understood that the name of its neighbors constitutes a price on its territory and has set the vite at the entry of Macedonia to NATO and EU.
The two governments have stretched a agreement on June based on the new proposed name, but the national oppositions believe that the change would cause the ethnic identity of the population of the Macedonia's most slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that it would not vote to the referendum, and the boxing campaign has made doubts about the possibility that the influence is achieved at the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the reference.
The question on the reference scheme is the following: "It is agreed with the approach to NATO and EU and accepting the Agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the change of the name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is the price to pay so that Macedonia may be accepted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the role of the ex Jugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they may live freely under the Easter of the European Union because this means a more safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally vinculating, a sufficient number of members of the Parliament has stated that it will respect the result of the vote to make it finally.
The change of the name would require a majority of two thirds in paragraph.
The State electronic committee stated that there were no reports of irregularity until 13:00.
However, the influence was only 16% respective to 34% of the last Parliament's elections in 2016, when 66% of the recorded electorers had expressed their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital electorer, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change of the name of the country that would open the door to the NATO and the European Union to Strumica, in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In the presence of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, he was preparing a small ball and systeming the seeds before the mount tens of those who want to boot the reference.
"We are for the NATO and the EU, but we want to enter high head, not for the service door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of the European Asian integration."
The Prime Minister Zaev states that the admission to the NATO will bring strongly necessary investments in Macedonia, which register a disemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the greatest majority will be pleased because more than 80% of our citizens is for EU and NATO," said Zeev after voting.
He stated that a " yeah" would be the "conferma of our future."
A published song last month from the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of the electorers would have participated in the referendum - a percentage under the requested refugee.
Another song made by Telma TV in Macedonia, she indicated that 57% of the interviews would have been going to vote to the Sunday.
In this 57%, 70% stated that he would vote for yes.
Since the reference is valid, the refugee must be more than 50%.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle to the political of the western filosof government since he was initiated to May last year.

The lab is not much tolerant.
He doesn't take people who say what they think
When the Moment Affairs of my local party voted to censure me, it was not a great surprise.
However, I am the last of a series of members of the Laboratory Parliament to which it has been reported to be not welcomed, and all because they said what they thought.
My partner Joan Ryan has received a similar treatment because he has been resolved to anxiety.
In my case, the censur movement criticed me to express my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the national security, on Europe, it is ironically all the arguments similar to those on whom Jeremy was agreed with the previous leaders.
The advertising for the meeting of Nottingham East Laboratory states that "we want to be included and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local lab party, the meetings of the evening were just like this.
However, this is not the sound of many meetings today and the promise of a more gentle and cortese policy has been forgotten for time, if it has been remembered.
It has always been clearer that different views are not tolerated in the Laboratory Partie and every opinion is judged on the fact that it is acceptable or less for the leadership of the Partie.
All this has started a little while after Jeremy became the captain of the Partie, and colleagues with which I thought to share a similar political vision have started waiting for a tendency investment from my part and that I would never accept, which would be of national security or of the unique European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they continue injury on social media who ask my retreat, declaring the policy of the centre and saying that I should not be part of the Laborist Partie.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm sure I'm more happy than other colleagues because the comments to me are in political nature.
I am surprised by the professionality and by the determination of those colleagues that have to face an insulting torrent of sexist or racist every day, but they do not let them be intimided.
One of the most vulnerable aspects of this political was the normalization of the levels of insultes.
Jeremy Corbyn stated the last week that the lab party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with each move of disagreement or modifying the election rules, the party is restricted.
In the past two years, I have been given many advices, invited me to cut off the head, not expressing my opinions and everything "I would have go well."
But it's not to do that I have entered into the political.
Since I came to the Laboratory Party 32 years ago, caused by the Government Thatcher's incursion, who had left my class of the secondary school letterly falling to pieces, I tried to protect the best public services for those who need more, in the quality of the local or minister of government.
I have never hid my political opinions, even at the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could remain in any way unconcerted by my political positions and from disagreement points with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the movement of Venedi, I would like to say that when the country is threatening to a Brexit that will destroy families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and energy by speaking about my loyalty to the Laborist party.
But in fact, the only message I am not for Nottingham Moment, but for my electors, who are members of the Laboratory Partie or less: I'm glad to serve you, and I promise that there's no threat of exclusion or political opportunity to stop me from defense of those I think I'm your best interests.

År 38 - 17 More: a Iar inbattute scale the classic
Two late trials may have been able to switch the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has meeted the trionfo in this exciting funeral party of the campionate day of Tennett.
I'm on top of the classic, the only team cut on ten.
At the end, it was their higher defense, as well as their audacia, who spread the house team and the coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games until and we are still inhabited, so I have to be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "I need to recognize Ayr's favor, they have benefited the opportunities of us."
The goal of Grant Anderson at 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr in advantage, but a yellow cartelling for the Scozia player Rory Hughes, switched from Warrios for the game, allowed Melose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot made an unconverted target.
Climo has increased the distance of Ayr with a rigor before, just half time, signing and then converting a goal from only to bring the Ayr to 17-5 to the range.
But the Melrose started well the second time and the goal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, has reduced the benefit to five points.
So there was a long interruption because of a serious lesion of Ruary Knott, which was made to steal, and at the restart, Ayr was balanced again thanks to a target of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The replacement captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson has received a yellow cartle and Melrose has paid the man in more with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team has been returned and when Struun Hutchinson received a yellow cartlin for a contrast with Climo without a ball, from the touch of the rigore, MacPherson marked a touch behind the mixed mixture in Ayr's progress.
Climo turned, as he had already done almost from the reboot, after Rowe had collected the calcium from the area of David Armstrong and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the team.

"The sea is our," Bolivia hopes that a court will repeat the path to the Pacific
The mariners have a general quarter of the ship revealing of sartiame in La Paz.
Public buildings spend a blue ocean color flag.
The ship bases from the Titicaca lake to the River of Amazzoni are decorated with the point: "The sea is our right.
Recover it is a deal."
In the whole Bolivia without smoking on the sea, the memories of the Perish Coast and now in the hands of Cile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still living, as the desire to solve the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may come to the maximum level in decades, while Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of liberation.
"The Bolivia has the slance, a spirit of unit and serenity and, of course, waits for the result with a positive approach," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomatic.
Many bulivians will watch the court of the International Court of Justice on large screens in the whole country, in the hope that the Court of Asia will welcome the review of Bolivia and - after decades of intermitted dialogue - the Cile is obligated to negotiate and guarantee the Bolivia a smoke on the sea of competence of the State.
Evo Morales, the Carismatic Indigenous President of Bolivia - that is against a fight against the reelection next year - has a lot in ballo with the Monday judgment.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analyzers think that the court will be difficult to decide for Bolivia and that it would not change if it would be done.
The United Nations organization with sitting in the Netherlands has no power to contribute to the cilindro territory and has needed that it will not determine the result of possible negotiations.
The fact that the court of the International Court of Justice arrived just six months after the ends indicates that the case “not was complicated,” stated Paz Zarate, a civil expert in international law.
And long to progress the bulivian cause, the past four years may have retard it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolated by the current boliban administration," said Zarate.
Morale's whispering retorical retoricals have shocked any good intention left in Cile, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile continue the negotiations at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions after what happened.
The two countries have not been changed by ambassadors since 1962.
The ex president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia to Asia, refused the idea that the decisional procedure of the Court would be particularly clear.
On Monday, Bolivia will "good extraordinary opportunities in relations with Cile" and will have the opportunity to "meet the end to 139 years of disagreement with reciprocal advantage," he explained.
Calzadilla also rejected the Morales - one of the most popular Presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as political scamotage.
"The Bolivia will never renew its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarma will not be untrusted in the United States
The Ministry of Northern Foreigners Ri Yong Ho stated that its nation will never make the disarmament of nuclear weapons if he can't trust in Washington before.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on the Sabbath.
He called the United States to have faith in the promises made during the summit of Singapore between the two river leaders.
His comments arrived when the Secretary-General of the USA Mike Pompeo seems to be trying to restart diplomatic treatments in stale after meeting Singapore with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong One.
It explains that it is a "illusion" that the prosecution of the sanctions and the opposite of the United States to a statement in the end of the Korean War can never be able to make the North Korea.
Washington disappeared by release the statement without the first Pyongyang effects of important disarmament actions.
If Kim, the President of the United States Donald Trump wants a second summit.
However, it is a scetism disruption on the fact that Pyongyang is intending to renew a arsenal that the country may be considered the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.

John Edward: language competences are essential for global citizens
Scosia independent schools maintain an accademic excellence curriculum, which is continued in 2018 with another series of exceptional results from the tests, strengthened by individual and collective success in the sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With more than 300,000 students in all Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), they will provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools are intended to prepare students for a next higher education, the choice and their place in the world as global citizens.
As the education sector can develop and adopt a personal school study plan, we observe that modern languages continue to be a popular and required in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that understands, the message will come to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother's tongue, the message will come to the heart."
It is a powerful reminder of the fact that we can't trust only in English if we want to create confidence relations with people of other countries.
From the results of the tests of this year, we can observe that languages are above the graduators, with the highest percentage of success in the independent schools.
The 68% of the students who studied strange languages has received the maximum of votes.
The data collected from 74 members of the SCIS schools have shown that 72% of students have received the maximum vote in Chinese, while 72% of those who have studied German, 69% of those who have studied French and 63% of those who have studied Spanish have received the maximum vote.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are promoting strange languages as fundamental competences for children and young people, which will be in doubt necessary in the future.
Today, languages, such as material choice, are considered at the same level of STEM materials (science, technology, technical and mathematical) in the study plans of independent institutions and other institutions.
An assembly conducted by the Commission of the United Kingdom for Employment and competences in 2014 found that the reasons that the dependents have indicated to the difficulty to cover works are at 17% of the cases in a missing language competence.
For this reason, language competences are always more employed to prepare young people to their future carriers.
With the more opportunities of work that require the knowledge of languages, these competences are essential in a globalised world.
Independently from the choice of the carrier, if you learned a second language, there will be an effective benefit in the future with a life-competence such as this.
The ability to communicate directly with people of other countries will take a multilinguish person automatically in the head of competition.
As youGov's sonage was between more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was not able to speak a strange language to a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language speaking by a percentage of two digits, 15%.
For this reason, investment in language education is so important for the children of today.
The knowledge of most languages, in particular of the economies in developing, will give children a better opportunity to find a valid employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different in teaching languages.
Several schools will focus on modern more classic languages, while others will teach languages that are the most important for the United Kingdom looking at 2020, such as the Chinese Mandarian or Japan.
Although it is the interest of your son, there will always be different languages in which you choose in independent schools, with the personal teacher specialized in this area.
Scosia independent schools are dedicated to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary competences for success, any of their future.
It is not possible to deny in a global trade system that languages continue to be fundamental for the future of the country, and this must be considered in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative competences".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and greatness for young people in Scotland.
We need to do it well.

The time of the random a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a raven raffine.
It is the first round of the five proposed for Trump in the next week, including stopped in friends locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation in sustenance for its election to cover the vacation place to the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections, because the Republicans cut the risk to lose the control of the Congress at the elections of November.
How will Trump's commission now be, and how can you follow it online?
The Commission of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the Trump committee in West Virginia online through YouTube disruption.
Trump will probably speak of the audiences of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which have been threatened because of sexual violence accusations with a vote of an anticipated confirmation of the Senate in arrest for a week while the FBI leads research.
But the main objective of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who have to face the elections of November to get a little spring.
Thus, the campaign of President Trump stated that these five rows during the next week are turned to "the energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that are held on the Senate and the room of the deputy," stands in Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so determined for its programme that the President will travel in the most possible number of States while we enter into the most emphasis of the campaign station," he said, "Trump campaign in Reuters, requesting to stay anonymous.

Ryder Cup 2018: the United States team shows the strength of fighting to keep the hopes alive to the individuals of Sunday
After three unique sessions, the Saturday Wednesday fourths may be what he needed this Ryder Cup.
The mote of the oscillating pants is a total sport concept in which the players believe firmly and never as a guarantee as these.
Where would the motor be now?
"They had a profit of six points, and now they are four, so I said we're keeping a little mote," said Jordan Spith while she's gone to the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, four points forward with other 12 other games.
The Americans feel that they have a little wind favorable, as he told Spith, and they have much to be expected, not last the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played all day and everybody's worthy three points on four.
Spieth was broken from the tee to green and gives the example.
The festival urls were become stronger hands that the game continued, faceing a crucial puzzle to compare the accounts to the fourth game, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His damn thing he made them win the game at 15 bucks was accepted with a similar url, what he says you believe that the American team is not yet out of the garage.
"You really have to take her all to worry about your game," said Spieth.
It's all that each of these players can do now.
18 bucks to make a point.
The only players with more Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unconfied version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but loveful partner of Europe is four to four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only copy to not take a Saturday Bogey tomorrow, but they also lost the bogey on Sunday morning, Friday and the fourth ship in the morning.
That path, and how their energy seems to flee from and to the classic crowd consolidate the certainty that they are players to fight tomorrow, and there would be no more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest an eventually European victory while the sun travels on Le Golf National.
Likewise, both of your different balls are likely.
However, the European glory talks are still prevented.
Bubba Watson and Webb Sipson made soon to get Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball of the morning, when he was in partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine buckets have cut down the Spanish and has been swift in a ship from which they haven't even been able to rise.
However, Sunday there is no one to help you out of your boat.
The fireballs and the fuels are so fascinating to observe nearby through interactions between the couples, the advice that they give and not give, and for the way strategies can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team and has buyed an important benefit in the final day, but this flight session has shown that the United States team has the strength to fight, which some, in particular States, have doubted.
Europe with a profit of 10-6 in the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid benefit in the final day of Ryder Cup after finally concluded fourball and saturday parts with a 10-6 benefit in the United States.
The inspired copy composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the carry with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the point to Le Golf National to four points.
The European Team of Thomas Bjorn, in trying to keep the loss trife in Hazeltine two years ago, has dominated on an American team unregularly in the fourballs of the morning, winning 3-1.
The United States have more resisted in the forests, winning two parts, but they have not been able to restore the disagreement.
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from 12 individual parts of Sunday to keep the trofe.
Fleetwood is the first European order to win four row points while he and Molinari, notes with the name "Molliwood" after a weekend sensational is the second copy to win four points of opening parts in the history of Ryder Cup.
After shooting Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they worked a superbly way to fight a bottom Woods and the southern American Bryson Dechambeau with a more net 54.
Woods, who has been moved for two Saturday games, has shown opportunities of geniality but has lost 19 of his 29 games in fireball and fourshops and seven rows.
Justin Rose, in relaxing during the fourballs of the morning, returned to the neighborhood of the partner Henrik Stenson in fourshops to battle 2 and 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka - number one and three of the world classified.
However, Europe has not obtained all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilate day in South-Occident of Paris.
The three big winter Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference for Americans with two Sabbath points.
They have received a green victory 2 and 1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball and then returned to batte Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the foursome, losing the two open skins.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point scart, although it's a title, Furyk's team needs only a couple to protect the trofe.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their cart.
North Korea is absolutely refused to the unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Ministry of the Foreigners of North Korea declared the United Nations on the Sabbath that the maintenance of sanctions had been uncertain to the disagreement of the country in the United States, that in these circumstances it would be absolutely refused to renew unilaterally to its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho has stated in the event of the General Assembly of the World Organization that the North Korea has adopted "important good will" measures during the last year, such as the stop of nuclear and missionary tests, the broadcast of the site for nuclear tests and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Now, however, we don't see any answer according to the United States," said he.
"No trust in the United States there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we refuse absolutely to disarma us unilaterally for the first."
Although Ri has re-used the lamentable notes on the resistance of Washington to a denuclearing "in fase" with which the North Korea would be premised based on gradual actions, its statement was important because he has not rejected the unilateral denuclearisation as already done by Pyongyang.
He refered to a joint statement released by Kim Jong One and from Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a president of US in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim was engaged to work to the "deucleation of the Korean penisola", while Trump promised the security of the Northern Security.
North Korea has seen a formal agreement for the 1950-53 Korea war, but the United States have said that Pyongyang should renew before its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also oppressed to calls to prevent international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The United States insists on the need to "the first have a denuclearisation" and to increase pressure levels with sanctions to get their goal in cohersive way and to be addicted to the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can put us into a genius is an illusion of who doesn't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the prosecution of sanctions increases our disagreement."
He did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States had announced to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, the Minister sublineed the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the controversy of this issue of denuclearisation would be the South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean penisola would not be to this dead point."
However, the sound of Ri's talk was sensitively different from the last year spoken to the United Nations General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to point as objective to the United States territory with the missions of the North Korea after the "the president of the evil" Trump called Kim a "misile" mission mission.
Instant to the United Nations Trump, which last year he had threatened to "destruire completely" the North Korea, turned out elogies on Kim for his strength to enter the path of the disarmament, but he stated that it must be done yet much and that sanctions will remain victorious until the denuclearing of the North Korea.
Mercoledì Trump stated that there's no disagreement, saying, "If you want two years, three years or five months, it's not matter."
China and Russia says that the United Nations Security Council should preserve Pyongyang for integrated actions.
However, the Secretary-General of the State, Mike Pompeo, declared jointly to the United Nations Security Council: "The respect of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with strength and without exceptions until the complete, final and accurate denuclearation is opened."
The Security Council supported the aims of control the North Korea in 2006 in trying to sustain the financing of nuclear programmes and balance mixtures.
Pompeo occurred with Ri on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly, and later stated that Pyongyang would be visited again the next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last journey has not gone well.
It was departed from Pyongyang in July, saying that they were made progress, but a few hours after the North Korea had accused him to have submitted "the requirements of gangster".
The North Korea was engaged during a meeting this month with Moon to spend a missionist site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "misure conform".
He stated that Kim explained him that the "conform measures" that would wish were security guarantees to which Trump was engaged in Singapore and actions in the direction of a normalization of relations with Washington.
The students of Harvard follow a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has spent all his students to sleep more in trying to contrary the growing male culture to study for all nights of coffee.
One university student found that students of university number one in the world often do not have ideas of basic concepts to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a doctor of dream at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which is the first of this type in the United States.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference he had given the impact of the missing dream on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why is this telling me only now when I am last year?'
He said that no one had never told you anything about the dream's importance, which was very surprised to me," said the The Telegraph.
In the first time of this year, students explain the essential concepts of how good lives associated with the dream can help the academic and athletic benefits and improve the general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services of University, stated that the university decided to introduce the course after he discovered that students suffered a strong dream for the week.
The course of one hour prevents a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a bedroom room, where students can choose coffee cups, tends, branches and books to know the effects of coffee and light and how the atletics offers are affected by the missing dream, and the importance of a night routine.
In another section, the participants are explained how long-term loss of dream can increase the risks of heart attacks, ictus, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, therefore encourages the participants to think about their journal routine.
"We know it will not change immediately the conduct of students.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to fum cigarette," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of the orgy linked to the "white night to study" is still stated, adding that modern technology and pressure are always greater on students bringing the missing dreams to be an increasing problem.
Sleep enough and with a good quality dream should be the secret weapons of students to fight the stress, the spouse, the anxie, he explained and addictively should be serving to prevent increasing because the missing dream brings the brain in the Indian mode, makeing the people constantly disappointed.
Raymond So, a 19-year-year-old Kalifornian student wrote to the factory of chemical and physical biologist, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after he followed one of his lessons last year during his first year in Harvard.
He explained that the corse opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a core relief in the entire campus.
The next step, hope, will be asked for all the laughed students to follow a similar study program before subscribed to this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set up a wave for when they have to go to bed, except for when they have to wake up, and to be conscious of the loss effects of the "Blue light" issued by electronic and LED screens, which can send the ritmo around day, bringing to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the gol of Menga breaks the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another depression attack outside of the house with the Dolly Menga gol that reviewed the disarmament team of Steven Gerrard to a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking for the first victory outside house from 4-1 February to St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team has influenced the second shot of Gerrard in 18 leaders to leave his team at eight points from the leaders in the fucking Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga marked seven minutes before the range and a training of Rangers shortly inspiration has never seen likely.
While Ranger goes now to the sixth place, Livingston sales the third, and only behind the Hybernian for the difference of gol.
And there may be more problems in coming for the Rangers after the guardline Calum Spence was healed for a harm to the head because of an object appearingly launched outside of the house.
Gerrard has made eight changes to the team, which has quickly supervised the Ayr in the half-ends of Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the only training that he took a point to Hearts last week and would be satisfied with the way his good team was prepared to suffice his own adversaries at every round.
The Rangers may have dominated for ball possession, but Livingston has used the balls better at its disposal.
They could have marked just two minutes after the filtering pass in Menga in the first time, Scott Pittman sent before to Allan McGregor's gate, but the center campaign disappeared the opportunity.
A depth of punishment in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs, therefore, found Captain Craig Halkett, but his company in defense Alan Lithgow could just go on the side of the second ball.
The Rangers took the control, but it seemed to be more hope than convinced in their game in the area of rigour.
Alfredo Morelos, sure, has considered to be sure to see a rigore to escape the fifth after a meeting with Steven Lawless, but the army Steven Thomson ignored the requirements of the Colonel.
Rangers could only take two times into the door in the first time, but the ex-porter of Ibrox Liam Kelly was not left to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head and a white shooter of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the open gol of Livingston at 34 minutes could be unexpected, nobody can deny that he has paid it only for his commitment.
Rangers newly failed to handle a placed calcium in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who held the calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard has acted during the range by replaceing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change has had an immediate impact because the aile has infiltred a ball in Morelos, but the exclusive Kelly has been cut off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to move visitors exactly in the type of game that they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who collected a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the distance in the final stages, but McGregor was oppressed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow get out of the angle.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton has submitted a last request for rigour after an inch with Jacobs but Thomson rejected him again.
Almanko: the investment of the Geiger accounter
And now one page from our Germany "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and the CONTEGIO continues... the day when the physical future John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger is born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure the radioactivity, an invention that has made the device known as Geiger account.
A stop point of science without then, the counter Geiger was also become a pop culture pillaster, when in the film of 1950 "Bells of Coronado", interpretated by those little credible scientists cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as the urini.
When you put these auriculars, you can really feel the effects of the atoms released from the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans, "It's a little bit out now!"
"Hans" Geiger was dead in 1945, only a few days since his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New vaccin against the cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells
A new vaccin against the cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
The vaccin teaches the immunitary system to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the elimination of immunitary cells from a patient, and their change in laboratory
So they can "see" a common protein in many types of tumor and then come back.
An experimental test of this vaccin is offering results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccin that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, has seen her cancer to the eggs for over 18 months.
The method involves the elimination of immunitary cells from a patient and their change in laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein of many types of cancer, called HER2, and then these cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States with seats in Bethesda in Maryland, stated: "Our results show that we have a very promised vaccin."
The protein HER2 "formute the growth of various types of tumor," including it at the sene, the eggs, the polmons and the colon-right, has explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure to extract immunitary cells from patients to "instruct them" how to hurt tumoral cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

HIV/Aids: China refers to a increase of 14% of new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these patologies, according to the sources of health authorities.
It has been reported about 40,000 new cases already in the second trimester of 2018.
The greatest majority of the new cases is due to sexual transmission, which indicates a change in respect of the past.
In some regions of China the HIV has been divorced in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, according to what the Chinese health authorities have stated during a conference in the provincies of Yunnan.
Years later, however, the number of persons affected by HIV and Aids in China increased by 100,000 units.
The transmission of HIV for sexual ways is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
The homosexuality was depenalised in China in 1997, but the discrimination in respect of LGBT people is still differences.
Since the traditional values of the country, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men at the end married with women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these reports.
In 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of the commitment to the management of the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects that a member of the staff has made the data of the GOP senators, and talks about "risicolose bugs" and "conspiration theory".
The United States Deputy declared at the Sabbath day the accusations of a member of his staff on the publication of personal information of three United States Republic Senators in the Wikipedia pages of lawers.
The Democratic Deputy of Los Angeles stated that the statements were made by opinionists and websites of the "over-right-right".
"Bugy, lying, and still spreading lying," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Public information would include home addresses and phone numbers of state Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online youngly, released by anonymous of the Campidoglio during a hearing of an expert committee on sexual violence accusations against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news escape has happened after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifiing the post source was associated with Waters' office and released information on a member of the Waters' staff.
"This informed accusation is completely false and a absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been made in repentance according to these false and tendency accusations, has not been responsible for the escape of such information.
This infringed accusation is totally false and a absolute lie."
Waters' statement has quickly generated critical online from the old print secretary of the White House, Ari Fleicher.
"This mind is wrestling," wrote Fleicher.
"This means that it does not have the character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he has not to worry.
It's not supposed to be provocator.
The reasons of the accuser should not be concerned.
You have to stay calm and serenous."
Fleicher seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the critical democratics to the judge Kavanaugh, which was accused by the deritors to seem too angry during the hearing of the younger.
Omar Navarro, a revolutionary candidate in curso to replace Waters in midterm elections, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
"Excellently confirmed," he twitted.
In its statement, the Waters stated that its office had allocated "the competent authorities and the powers of the order of these tendency statements.
"We will do that the responsibilities will be dismissed," he continued, "and they must respond to all their dangerous actions and noble for all members of my staff."
Johnny English recension still hits - the parody of the spring with a Rowan Atkinson subdimensioned
It has now been discussed to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British tock, and it seems to be applied to this review of the Johnny English action commission, started in 2003 and returned in life in 2011 with Johnny English - The reach.
The car rental on the subject of which we do is the new opportunity for exporting the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the face of goma and the eyes out of the orbit has received his licence to insert things for the second time - and his name indicates more than all that is about a comic creation developed for countries of non-anglophones.
Obviously, it is the secret agent that, although his strange glamour prices have a little Clouseau, a tockle of Mr. Bean and a pizzle of that type who has contributed to a single note on the moments of Gloria of the opening of the olympical games in London 2012.
It is a personality that initially based on the traveller and international mysterious man that Atkinson has interpreted at the time forgotten the Barclaycard TV announcements, which left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two sympatic moments in this last exit of Johnny English.
I loved Johnny English that you are close to the helicopter indossing a medieval weapons and the others spherrage shortly against his elmo.
The gift of Atkinson for the physical community is clear, but the humor seems to be low-dimensioned and weirdly overflowed, especially now that films of "shirt" as 007 and Mission can't now offer the comicness as ingredient.
The humor seems to be direct to children instead of adults and for me the passions of Johnny English are not so original and look like the gags of the muted films of Atkinson when Mr. Bean interprets.
The immutable pressure now is the fact that the British is seriously dangerous.
A informatic hacker has been infiltred in the supersecret web of British spy, opening the identities of all the British agents on the field, with a disappointment of the loaded agent, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the hot that makes the vault for a first presuntuous and tortured minister, which has already suffered a political impolar trail: Emma Thompson makes her best with this like-Teresa May, but there is no much about working in the copy.
His intelligence's advice tells her that each single active spy has been compromised and that it will be to call someone already gone in prison.
And this means that the crazy Johnny English, which now works as school leaders in a chic stability, but it also learns lessons in official ways about how to be a undercover agent: here you can appreciate some sympatic gags when English offers a type of spioning course of school of Rock.
English is broken in Whitehall for an emergency letter and is gathered together with his ex suspicious partner Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married with a submarine commander, a role of a girl of high society in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little crazy.
So the Batman and Robin's disasters for the secret services of Sua Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister falls dangerously into the billionary carismatic network of the technology that states that he can resolve the information problems of the Great Britain: the left Jason Volta, interpretated by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odds of ridiculous events: traveling from cameraries, steal the fire into a French restaurant; they scatter the hell clandestly entering themselves on the yacht of Volta's luxury and English creates pure anarchie while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take destitution with the house of Volta.
All scenes are sure ideated for the last sequence, but for what shit and exuberant, there's a little good TV for children in the history.
Everything's enough modest.
And how happened with the other films of Johnny English, I couldn't do less than think: the British cinematographic industry could not assign Rowan Atkinson a role that justifies his talent?
The Laboratory Partie refuses to be developing a plan so that the British can work four days for week but be paid for five
The Laboratory Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radial program that allows the British citizens to work for four days for week, although they are paid for five.
The Partie would wish that the major companies transmit the repairs received by the revolution of the artificial intelligence (IA) to workers offer them a day of extra retard.
In this way, the dependents may enjoy a weekend of three days, keeping the same payment.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the Economic Programme of the Partie and the plans to include the country for workers.
The pass to a day of four days has been declined from the convention of syntaxed as a way for workers to take profit from the economy in evolution.
An elder member of the Laboratory Partie stated the Sunday Times: "In the end of the year, the announcement of a review of the political line."
"It will not come from one day to another, but a working week of four days is a online aspiration with the approach of the party to the requilibration of the economy for workers and its industrial strategy."
The Laborist Partie would not be the first to support a similar idea, since the Green Partie promised a four-day work week in the area of the general electoral campaign of 2017.
In any way, this aspiration does not apply when the Laborist Partie is a single support.
The Laboratory Partie stated: "A four-day working week is not part of the political line of the Partie and is not currently discussed."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has used the Laboratory Conference of last week to specialize its vision of a socialist revolution in economic field.
Mr. McDonnell stated that it was determined to reach the power of "directors without face" and "spectaculars" in public services.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also implied that the current actionists of the water distribution company may not recover their complete assionary package, since the laboratory government could implement the "deductions" based on illegal behavior.
He also confirmed the plans to inserte dependents in the administration Councils of enterprises and to create inclusive participation funds, in order to transfer 10 per cent of the net country of the private sector to those used, which concluded in annual shares to 500 £.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy says "60 minutes" if the FBI research on Kavanaugh could make them change the idea
The investigation of the FBI in the area of accusations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh has revoked the final vote for his name to the Supreme Court at least a week, and explains the doubt if the findings of the Government Agency can influence or less than some of the republic senators to provide their support.
In an interview that will go in a Sunday wind, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republic Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible that the FBI brings something to the light to induce them to change the idea.
Kennedy has appeared more openly respected his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it when I got to hear, I said, I talked to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that came out of that accusation, I said, "Have you done it?"
It was resolved, determined, unequivocable."
The vote of Graham, however, seems cut off in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb test accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has rejected it energy," added Graham, refering to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you names couldn't prove it.
36 years ago.
I can't see anything again in change."
What is the Global City Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will welcome the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the emergency of a famous star carrier and has a mission likely considerable: to end the poverty in the world.
After the week editing, the Global Citizen Festival will see decades of thousands of people returning to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performance such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also a sensibilisation on the real purpose of the event, which is to end to extreme poverty within 2030.
The Global City Festival, which has started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to remove poverty, increased the number of people who are currently fighting it.
In order to receive a free license for the event (as if you were not ready to pay for a VIP bill), the concert public had to take a series of competents, or "actions" as to do voluntary, send email to a world leader, make an phone call or any other significant way that contributes to sensibilisizing their purpose to remove poverty.
But, in fact, how long has the Global City Festival now remained 12 years to get the prefixed goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a true way to persecute people to ask a call to action, or is it just another example of the "clicktivism"- people who feel really to do the difference just signing a request online or sending a twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million "actions" of its own supporters, operatives for a lot of different goals.
It explains that these actions have contributed to issue global leaders to preach more than 37 billion dollars, which are destined to influence, within 2030, more than 2.25 billion people.
In the first year of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced their actions, which have already been broken or used as funds at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the protectioned capital funds have exercised a direct impact on about 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executors with seats in the United Kingdom, committed to "assistance to children to grow at the maximum of their potential", with the promise of delivering to Ruanda 35 million dollars to contribute to eliminate pollution in the country, after having received more than 4.700 tt from Global Citizens.
" With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and the Global citozens as well as you, we can do so that social injustice or unnaturation become a footnote in the history," said the people's advisor of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman during a concert from London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after being taken more than 5000 actions calling to the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government has announced the extension of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through the interests of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQ presents on their website, who asked, "What do you think we can end up to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard path - some of us will fall and we will miss.
But, as the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us, we can, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will occur in the event of this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Sea to carry out "a block" and stop the Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Internal
Washington can, "if necessary", to remind his own marina to prevent that Russian energy sources are available on the market, including the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the United States of the United States Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke assessed that Russian commitment in Syria - in particular, where he operates on the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason for which they are in the Middle East in the fact that they want to negotiate for the energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the South Europe's fulfillment," would have stated.
And, according to the workers, there are measures and ways to make you face.
"The United States have the possibility, thanks to the sea, to ensure that the nautican rotes are open and, if necessary, to carry a ship block, so that their energy will not be built on the market," said.
Zinke has turned to the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that automatically defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He has compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that I am, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, that is to take financial and replace carburants," said, refering to Russia as "not-verbal", with an economy depending on fossil combustibles.
The statements were made because Trump's administration was involved in a mission to ensure the export of its liquid gass in Europe, and to replace Russia, the option that for European consumers is absolutely the most economic.
For this purpose, the Trump officers, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, tried to convince Germany to take away from North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" project that, according to Trump, made Berlino "prigioniera" in Moscow.
Moscow showed more times that the North Stream 2, gased from 11 billion dollars, thought to raise the capacity of that present to 110 billion cubic, is a project of economic value.
The Cremlin objects that the sustained opposition of Washington to the project is guided just by economic reasons and is a example of sleeling competition.
"I believe that we share the opinion that the energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should have the possibility of choosing the providers," said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after a meeting held in September in Moscow with Rick Perry, Secretary for the Energy of the United States.
The position of the United States has broken the negative reaction of Germany, which has revealed its commitment in the field of the project.
The Federation of Tedesche Industries (BDI) has requested the United States to stay out of the policies for the energy of the European Union and by the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see a great problem that a third State interfers in our energy approval," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of Tedesche Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Annulation of Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Terry Brandstad, an ambassador of the United States in China and previously a long-term ruler of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods in China, stated that Pechino had destroyed American workers, accountants and businesses.
The Chinese, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "how he increases those proposals by publishing public propaganda on our free journals."
"In the divorce of its propaganda, the Chinese government serves the loved American tradition of the freedom of word and print, placeing a publicity to pay in the Moines Register," wrote Brandstad.
"Viceversa, in the building on the road here in Pechino, you will find dissided votes and you will not see any real reflection of the distinct opinions that the Chinese population could have the problem of the economic traiteration of China, because the media are under the end of the Chinese Communist Party," wrote.
He added that "the one of the most journalists of China has chosen the offer to publish" his article, although he has not stated that the journal has been done.
The Republics are alienating the women electronic electronic before the half elections sent with Kavanaugh case, they warn the analists
Since many republicans defend the name of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and stay from his part in the presence of several accusations for sexual molesties, analysts have reported that you will see a negative reaction, especially by women, in the future half-mand elections.
The action to this regard was extremely high, and many republics have already been officially demonstrated to continue with a vote.
"You can't remove these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for a public article on the Sabbath.
Reeher declared that the instantness of the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an investigation of the FBI will be sufficient to place the cold electors.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it nor tomorrow nor to November," said, "Women will not be forgotten, according to the reporting of the Washington Journal, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, an elder and national advisor of the progressive group MoveOn.
Wednesday morning the manifestants repeated the slogan "November is coming!" in the course of their protest in the Senate room, when the Republicans who control the Commission have chosen to continue with the candidate of Kavanaugh instead of the witness of the Dut. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The entusiasm and the motivation of the Democratics are going to the star," said to the news Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analysis.
"The people say that they're already high, it's true.
But they may be higher, especially between the indecisive electricity of the equipment and the young electronic, between 18 and 29 years, which often do not vote to the President."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which has provided the details of his sexual offences against the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analyzers have suggested that it would be possible to check a negative reaction if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP has become confused together," stated Michael Steele, President of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of the last week.
"It's not only about the vote for the Committee, the final or if Kavanaugh will be put into the bank, it is also the way the Republicans have managed the situation and the way they have treated it," he noted the channel of the news Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the Democratics.
In any case, the Americans seem to be divided in some way between the person to believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small percentage for this last.
A new youGov's new song shows that 41% of the interviews has certainly believed in Ford's witness, while 35% stated that he was sure or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, the 38 percent declared that Kavanaugh was probably lying in his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's instinct, the FBI is currently conducting research on the accusations carried out from Ford, as well as at least from one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to what the Guardian reported.
The last week Ford testified, before the Secretary-General's Court, that Kavanaugh was in Hebrew status when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez supports that the candidate to the Supreme Court took his parents during a party in Yale's studies in Ottanta.
The World Wide Web Inventor projects to start to a new Internet to shift Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, is running a startup that is trying to refer to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and to what people can have access and information.
In a exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee struck about the fact that the hidden intention behind Inrupt is "domine the world."
"We have to do this now," said the startup.
"It's a story moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "on-line personal data store" or a POD.
You can include contact lists, tasks, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unity of the home data store online is that it is completely choiced by the user who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls him "Personal potential through data".
The idea for Inrupt, as refers to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, is to bring resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently joined from Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safe platform buyed by IBM, some developers in the staff assets to work for the project, and a voluntary programmer community.
Since this week, the world's technology programmers can give life to their decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not say to "Facebook and Google if you enter or not a complete change where their business models are completely separated from one day to another.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post on the publiced Medium Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is the search for commercial energy and a ecosystem that contributes to protect integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee represented a influenced vote in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the World Wide Web Consortium Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incrediblely optimist about this new was from the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Remembered the church of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only churchist of England church to be premished with a Victoria Cross during the First World War of War was spoken in his birth city after 100 years.

Saturday in a stop in Rushden, in Northhamptonshire, his two nipotes have involved a memorative lake.
One of his nipotes, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic" the fact that the stone would be inaugurated exactly to 100 years from the pregnant product of his grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the locating column Van led his battaglione over the Saint-Quentin Channel "with a fatful neighbour, under the pest fire of the field and war machines."
Then he fell to the fire line, and with the "greatest galaxy" he progressed the line before he got running with a single hand canon and attacked three of the distance.
The placement Colonel Vann was killed by a German cequin on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.

He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set a flower crown after the stop, conducted by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, "I felt really honored to recognize a role in the stop" and added "the value of a real hero is shown by the support that will be given him by many people."
The fans of MMA remained all night to look at Bellator 206, and however, Peppa Pig
Imagine a little bit, you've stayed up all night to look at the famous Bellator 206 only to see you negative the vision of the main event.
The programme from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and should be sent to the United Kingdom during the night, directly on Channel 5.
At the 6th morning, just when Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were prepared to explore, the telespectors in the United Kingdom were stayed sad when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained based after they remained awake until the first hour of the morning, particularly for fighting.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to the animated carton for children as "a kind of shirt of evil pleasure."
"The Government Regulation prevents that this content was not more appropriate for the six of the morning, so it had to go to the programming for children," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of the Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked for the transfer.
"Peace the hair," "Yes."
"The President of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, stated that they will work on the programming to include telespectors from the United Kingdom in future.
"I think when I think the replay, I think we can probably find a solution," said Coker.
"But there are the six of the Sunday morning, and we can't find a solution before the Sunday of our hour, for their lunch.
But we're working.
Trust me, when the program was changed, there came a lot of messages and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to resolve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a governmental problem.
I promise you that the next time you won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we do normally - and we tried to get so much for the fans, and we just discussed it.
It's a difficult situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has heard "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic Nootator Tom Daley says that he has grown up by feeling less than anyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to have success.
The 24th stated that it would not be taken into account until it came to the secondary school, because the fact that "not all are like me."
Talking in the first point of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, represented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had made his voice on the rights of gay to give " hope" to others.
He also stated that he became parents did that it would be less important to win the Olimpiadi.
The representative of the old date programme, Kirsty Young, has been taken a number of free months for disease.
Presenting as an emergency in Laverne's first programme, Daley stated that he had heard "besides" any other while he grows because "not socially acceptable the fact that he liked the boys and girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, there were things that really gave me power and energy to have success."
He wanted to try to be "also," he said, so that nobody would delay if, in the case, they had discovered his sexuality.
The two times of bronzo medal to Olimpiadi became an activity of high profile of LGBT and used his face in the Commonwealth Games Australians in this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice because he felt happy to live openly without consequences and wanted to give " hope" to others.
The three times of the world's campaign said that the fact that he was unbelievable of a man - the statuant record Dustin Lance Black, who knew in 2013 - "he made me surprise."

"I was holding the hand when she stopped to respira and until she really stopped and died, I wasn't yet realized that it wasn't invincible," said.
The next year Daley has guaranteed Olimpiadi 2012, winning the bronzo.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed for my whole life - wearing before a house public in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olimpiadys and still makes him come to the occasion floor.

The outside form Mickelson was set in panchine in the Ryder Cup of Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will sign a Sunday record when he's playing his 47th match of Ryder Cup, but he'll have to go back in a way to refuse you become an infected miles of stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennal event for a twelve times since record, was put into a panchine from Captain Jim Furyk for the fireballs and the Saturday fours.
Instead of staying in the center of the action, as often for the United States, the five times campaign has passed the day between the cheerleader and work on their game in the range, in the hope of correcting what it hurts.
While it was never the most strongest drivers even at its carrier's carriage, 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unconnexed path regularly punishes wrong crimes.
And if the path for yourself was not enough funny, Mickelson, in the nineth match, before the exact campion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the new Tommy Fleetwood to win all and four their match in this week.
If the Americans, from four points under the beginning of their 12 single match, go with a boolish beginning, the match of Mickelson could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
"He completely understood the role that he had today, he gave me a piece on the ball, he put a arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and he added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine it to play two games.
I thought more, but this is the way he went and this is the way we thought he should go.
He wants to share, just like anyone else."
Mickelson's Sunday record will over Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
He could sign the end of a carrier in Ryder Cup that has never reviewed his personal record's heights.
Mickelson has 18 games 20, 20 shots and seven pares, even if Furyk said that his presence has brought goods intangible to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, I don't know, you like to take a game of people, and it's a great boy to have in meetings," explained.
"I believe also that the youngest players have been nice to cry against him this week, one thing that was nice to look.
He's done much more than playing."
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can be quickly disappeared
Thomas Bjorn, Captain of Europe, knows for experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily be converted into a crash.
The Danish started in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team, captained by Seven Ballesteros, unless a distance of five points from the Americans, came to the line of the treatment with a minimum benefit, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I continue to repeat that we had a good benefit in Valderrama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we win, but a little," says Bjorn (the photo) after I saw the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6 to Le Golf National.
"Therefore the story will be shown to me and to my team that's not finished.
Tomorrow, you need to give the maximum.
He must go out there and do everything right.
It's not finished until the points are marked in the lavage.
Our goal is to try to win the trofe, and it is about that we must concentrate.
I'm always focused on 12 players of my team, but I know well who's on the other side: the best golfists of the world."
Bjorn added: "I would never be over.
That's a different difference tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the round of individual performances, which is another thing.
It's nice to be there with a team team when things are good, but when you're only your golfist capacity are set to hard test.
This is the message that you need to send to the player: tomorrow, you must take out the best of you.
Then, you forget your companion because he also needs to go out and get out the best of himself."
In contrast of Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek the best individual performance in his players than team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both parts in those large meetings of the last day, made part of the team winning in Brooklyn before losing the "European Medinah Miracolo".
"I remember each single word," he commented in answer to the question on the way Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, led his players in head in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important parts, but we want to leave immediately with the right feet as we did in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When the game begins to take a certain piece, pressure increases in the middle games.
That is why we organize our training of consequences and classify the boys in the way it seems necessary, because tomorrow we're trying to make a magic.
Thomas was given to the committee to guide the controversy and to face Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I have chosen this order because I think he covers the path until the end," said Bjorn about his choice for individual meetings.
The new military ship in Germany has been raised again
According to the local media, the last frequency of the German military Sea would have been committed in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the frid war time, but it will not be at least until the next year because of defect systems and an imposed costs.
The Commission of Rheinland-Pfalz, the new frequency ship of the Baden-Württemberg class, was posted to the first half of 2019, according to the Day Time journal quoting a military portion.
The ship should be joined to the military Marine in 2014, but concerns following the delivery have punished the destination of the environmental project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the military marine in 2007 will replace the old ships of Bremen class.
They will be given from a powerful canon, a gamma of anti-aeroplane and antinave missiles as well as some hidden technology, such as radios, infra-rounds, and accused signs.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods, for it should be possible to use the new freightes to two years away from the national gates.
However, the retard continues implied that the innovative ships of war, which are said, will be allowed to Germany to provoke their power to be excessive, will be already obsolete when they enter the service, noting the Day Time.
The fresh suffering Type F-125 has reported last year when the German military marine has denied officially to commission the ship and returned it to the ship Blohm & Voss of Amburg.
It was the first time the military marine returned a ship to the building after the construction.
They have not heard about the reasons of the restitution, but the German media have noted a number of critical "software and hardware" that have made the unusual ship if used in a fight mission.
The carencies in the software were particularly important in which the ships of Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by an equipment of about 120 marine, just half of the oldest ships of Bremen class.
Furthermore, the ship is decisively too decisive, and this reduces its benefits and limits the possibility of the military Sea to add future updates.
It is considered that the Rheinland-Pfalz, of 7000 tonnes, is two more pest than the same class ships used by the Germany in the Second World War.
In the part of the defect hardware, the cost of the whole project (including equipment management) is a important question.
It seems that it has reached 3,1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars) from the initiatives 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involved in the new fregate are particularly important to the light of recent warnings on the reduction of the force of Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary Commissioner for Armate Forces, has granted that the military Sea actually "Scarsy of ships can be used".
The officer stated that the question was worse in the time, since old disarmament ships were not replaced by new ships.
His ramarist is that no one of the Baden-Württemberg class could join himself to the military marine.
The National Trust scatters the secret life of pistolers
New searchs conducted in a highland scoce treatment looks to find the way pistolers use the view to find food.
It is confident that the findings can make light on the behavior of the only flowing mothers and guidance of future protection activities.
The study of scientists of National Trust for Scotland will follow common pistolers and surface, except the white ears and the pistolers of Daubenton to Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special registrators will be located in key places around the property to track the activities of pistolers during the station.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also lead mobile studies with the use of portable revelators.
The analysis of sounds registered by an expert will determine the frequency of the requirements of pipesters and the way each species is conducted.
They will then be produced a map of livestock and a report to create a detailed frame on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, advice for the protection of the nature for the NTS, hope that results can be discovered what areas of residence are more important for pistolers and how these are used by each species.
These information will help us to determine the benefits of lives management works, such as the creation of plants, and how to maintain the bows for pistolers and other connections.
The population of pistolers in Scotland and the United Kingdom is notedly reduced in the past century.
The pistolers are risking because of building and development works interesting in triples and ruining lives.
Moreover, holes and lighting turbines can be a threat, as well as the young card and some chemical treatment of building materials, besides the attaques of home cats.
The pistolers are not really lying.
Nevertheless, because of their lives of night shopping, their ears are more useful than the eye when it's trying to make a fat.
They use an eco-localisation sophisticated technical to identify insects and residues on their treatment.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 history buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 earthquakes in the country, takes very serious pistolers.
Ten qualitative experts are regularly conducting research, inspectioning the three and some of the savings.
The organization has still established the first reserve of Scotland destined only to the pistolers at Threave's holding, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway, which is at least eight of the ten types of pistolers of Scotland.
The maintainer, David Thompson, states that property is the ideal territory.
"Who in Threave we have a large area for pistolers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many age trees, and a good place.
But there's a lot about the pistolers we still don't know, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about their growth needs."
Sublines the importance of controling pistols before leaving the maintenance within the properties as possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother tripulation can kill until 400 women and small women, may be scattered through a whole local population.
The pistolers are protected and is illegal to kill them, to mourn them, to destroy them, or to destroy their trips.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scozia responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have much to learn about our pistolers and for many of our species we don't know as if they pass their populations."
Ronaldo rejects the crazy accusations while legals are caused to the German week
Christian Ronaldo labeled the crazy accusations against him as "false notices", saying that people "the people want to be published" with his name.
His legal laws are prepared to cause the German week of Der Spiegel who has published the accusations.
The attractive Portuguese of Juventus was accused to have violated a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel of Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also has noted Friday the accusation of payment of $375,000 to keep silence on the accusation.
In a video on Instagram directly to his 142 million followers, in the following hours of accusation, Ronaldo, 33 years old, he broke the statements as "false notes".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says Pallone d'Oro turned to the videocam.
"They want to be published through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to make my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and it's all right," he added the surprising calcier.
According to the Reuters, the laws of Ronaldo are prepared to make the cause of Der Spiegel in respect of the accusations, defined "increasing report of suspects on the private field".
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the challenger will ask a rearing for "moral donations in the respective measure of the gravity of the violation of privateity, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights of the last years."
The fact would have been located in June 2009 in a seat of the Palms Casino Resort of Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discoteca, Ronaldo and Mayorga would be entered into the room of the chamber, where he submitted it to an annual violence, according to the statements deposited to the District Court of Clark, in Nevada.
Mayorga suspects that Ronaldo would have been set in a junior after the accusation says that it is for "99 percent" a "beloved boy" delicious from one percent."
In the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that both had a sexual relationship, but that was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that he had been directed to the police and in the hospital, where its lesions were photographed, but he had then agreed to a conciliation agreement as he felt "terrorized by the retorsions" and concerned by the prospect of "coming publicly humbled."
34-year-old time to refuse the agreement, supporting being traumaticed by the present incidence.
Ronaldo was on the point of pass to the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the accusation, and this state will be joined to the Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will repair forever the loss of auto-builders
The United Kingdom could "forever renew" the loss of its world leader's status in the built of cars after Brexit, stated the Minister of Greg Clark Industrie.
He added also to be "occupied" for the statements made by Toyota UK to BBC in respect of the eventually outcome of the Great Britannia from the EU without a agreement and the current block of production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a agreement," said the Ministry Clark.
The Japanese automobilist house supports that the retards at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, may fall on workplaces.
Burnaston's manufacturer, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are built about 150,000 cars last year, from which 90% was exported in the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if the British will go out of the EU at the end of March, the production in our manufacturer will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota to Burnatton.
Increasing concerns in other English automobiles for the outcome of the EU without a agreement on the operation of the transfrontal trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, supports that after Brexit, will close her Mini in Oxford for a month.
The main concern regards the risks in the delivery chain found by the constructors in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the "just in time" concept, with parts that arrived every 37 minutes from English and European providers for ordering vectors.
If the United Kingdom will leave the EU without a agreement on 29 March, they may be achieved by disagreements to the borders that would cause to late and late parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory value in its establishment of Derbyshire, he declared the company, therefore the production would be stopped.
The Minister Clark supports that the Teresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "increased with precision to prevent these disagreements to the borders".
"We need a agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to collect this opportunity," said to the Today of the BBC Radio 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota, but also from the other car buildings, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what was a great distribution string."
The Toyota was not able to say how long the production could stop, but in long term, warn that additional costs could reduce competitiveness of the equipment and potentially the workplaces.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the responsible for the syntax delegates of the consumer, states that the works are strongly concerned: "Because my experience, when the workshops are reduced, they will not be reintegrated."
A government portfolio stated: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be remitted again, confirms the White House.
The high risk meeting of Donald Trump with the Vice Ministry of Judge Rod Rosenstein may be "requested for a week," while the debate on the judge Brett Kavanaugh continued, he declared tomorrow the White House.
Rosenstein suspects the work of the special officer Robert Mueller who gives Russian interference to the elections, the legs between Trump and Russia, and the event of justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could release the Vice- Ministry of Justice, thus risking the independence of Mueller, has feeded the Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about a cycle to record talks with Trump and try to remove the President through 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last morning he went to the White House and voted that he was to leave.
However, it was announced for marketing a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I would not" leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was rejected to prevent a superposition with the hearing of the Senate Committee of Justice in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
Wednesday, Trump ordered a week of educational issues by the FBI against Kavanaugh, reiterating the final vote of the Senate.
Wednesday, Trump's portrait, Sarah Sanders, is compared to Fox News.
Asking on the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "No date has been established, it may be this week, I imagine it will be left for another week considering all that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll continue to update the print."
Some journalists may test this statement: Sanders does not have a bridge with printing at the White House since 10 September.
The driver Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders stated that the scars of breefing is not due to an advertising for television journalists "that they're going to show," although he said, "Don't discuss with the fact that they're invisible."
So he did think that the direct contact between Trump and the print may be more frequenter.
"The President has more sessions in the morning and answers than any president before him," he said, "We have checked the digits."
The briefing will still be, said Sanders, "but if the print has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the President of the United States, it is very better to talk to me.
We are trying to do this, as in the last weeks, and this will replace the briefing with the print and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump responds regularly to the questions when the White House leaves or participates in open sessions or press conferences with officers in visit.
Print conferences are weird.
This week in New York the President may have shown the reason, makeing a free road talk, and at the same time, before a group of journalists.
The Ministry of Health writes to the European Scosia NHS workers to express its concerns on Brexit

I know that this is a period of great concern for you all.
Therefore, I wanted to reward my appreciation for the contribution given by all members of the personnel, independently from nationality.
The colleagues from the entire EU, not only, bring precious experiences and competences that strengthen and improve health services work, bringing benefits to patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
Scotland is sure your house and we will strongly want you to leave here."

The handbra will be seen as a trial to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to get young electronic electronics with the promise to provide more accessible prices and higher prices.
The increase of the investment will be applied to individuals and companys who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the initiative of the Government to fight the phenomenon of the non-technology.
The surface, which is added to the current ball setting, including the high levels entered two years ago on the second houses and on the immobilier buy to less (comprehensive to be accepted), may constitute more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Treasury prevents that the manufacturer can collect up to 120 million sterlines per year.
An estimated 13% of the new buildings in London are buyed by non-permanent citizens in the United Kingdom, increased prices and makes difficult to enter the first house in the immobilier market.
Many of the most richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "the fantastic citizens" because of the great number of strangers who pass the most of the time outside of the State.
The new policy came for a few weeks after Boris Johnson had requested a piece on the board in order to help the youngest with the first house's buy.

However, it would not be just if the buying of a house would be likely easy for people who do not reside in the United Kingdom and for the external society, as it is for British resident workers.
For many people the dream of inheriting a house has become too far and the dignity of unbelievers remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest aspiration is the leader of Scotland"
The technical Director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is that to be the manager of Scotland before or then.
Scozias, 42 years old, is attracted by the disagreement to resolve the North-East Team that is currently at the third place in League One, at three points from the beach.
It is approved to Stadium of Light this state after being held at St. Miraren's guidance during the Scottish Premiership of the last stage.
"I wanted to play for my country as calciator.
I was in a series B, and this is all," said Ross to the Sportsound Sports.
I grew looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father of child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, it will only be possible if I'm done as a team manager."
The predecessors of Ross to the guidance of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The old technology of Alloa Athletic supports no anxie in doing so important names, in a team more important, with the previous respect of the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me in this time is measured with the ability to return the team to Premier League."
Considering the structure and the structures of the club, we can say that it is in doubt to the Premier League," he stated.
"It's not a easy job, but I think I'm going to happen only if I can get the team."
The launch of the carrier by Ross manager is three years ago, after a period as a assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement of Hearts leacher.
Then he helped Alloa to save himself from back to the third level and brought the St. Mirren from the front of the backsession to the title of campions of Championship, the next stage.
Ross suspects to feel much more at his age now that not during his carrier carrier in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"You've probably been treated of a real point of exercise," remembers the direction of the Alloa.
"I really believed that the role of manager was supported for me, more than the player.
It seems weird because I worked well, I won't live, and I had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you need to face weekly.
I still advise you in stress and pressure of work, but the management seems good.
I always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, I feel very quieter than I've never been in my life."

The excessive heavy fall has brought greater income to English pubs in difficulties and more concerns to the restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar have seen a increase in the sales of 2,7 per cent to July, while the insufficiency of restaurants are covered by 4,8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consultation company, set the data together and commented: "The summer persistency and the long permanence of England in the Worlds has done that the month of July followed a path like the June, when the pubs were over 2,8 per cent, while the restaurants were struggled hardly.
The role of 1,8 per cent in the restaurant to June is worse in July.
Pubs and bars in which perlopius drinks have resulted the strongest results, with a higher homogeneous increase of the restaurants.
Even the pubs in which they eat have suffered the hot, even though I was not exciting as the restaurants.
Looks like people wanted to just go out to drink something.
In the pub and in the bar management of the drinks are 6% in the month, while the consumption of food is covered by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analysis of the recreative and renewable sector of RSM, stated: "This result continues the trend we have seen at the end of April.
The meteo and the impact of the main social or sportive events remains the main factor when it is trying to sell in the market to detail.
It doesn't surprise that restaurants continue to fight, although a total of the sales of 4,8 per cent of the year will be particularly serious in addition to the continued pressures on costs.
The long hot state couldn't have arrived in a worse period for restaurants and only the time can say if the most moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed at August, will give us a needful tragedy."
The global growth of the sales between pub and restaurants, including the new opening, was 2,7 per cent in July, reflecting the roll-out roll-out roll.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sale company for pubs, bars and British restaurants set together and analyzes the data on the prestations through 47 operating groups, with a combinated factory of over 9 billion sterlines, and it is the reference company of the sector.

Thank you for the encouraging messages!".
The publication of a ticket sets up with mothers and mugs and share online opinion
A producer company of a ticket has divided the view in a network with a publicity that makes respect to the mothers who attach and mugs that are moving.
To indicate the start of what is defined as the "the first ticket of the world silence and indoble", Elvie consuming technology company has launched a publicity under a sharp musical video to show the freedom of expressing himself as the mothers given by the new ticket.
Four real mothers ball in a muck box on a track that includes songs like: "Yes, I shoot the latte but I have nothing" and "If I didn't notice it, these are not mamples but my teeth."
The core continues to say, "Take it out, take it out, feed the kids, take it out, take it out, shoot the latte to my lord."
However, the publicity, published on the Facebook pages of the society, caused polemics in network.
With 77,000 comments and hundreds of comments, the video has reacted different reactions between the visualizers, many of which have supported that he put the "orrories" of the late-caseary industry.
"A defect decision to use the muscles to publish the product.
Like us, they also must stay incinerous and parent to produce the latte, except the fact that their little ones are rubbered to him a few days from the birth," wrote someone.
Elvie's ticket is insert with discretion under a mom's regulatory
Somebody else commented: "Complainly traumatic is for the mother and for the little.
But yes, why don't you use them to publish a ticket for your mother who will continue to keep their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really a publicity without sense."
Others have defended him, and a woman has still stopped finding the "amusant" brain.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still getting up, I'd like to have one.
When I used the ticket, I felt like a muck.
The public is a little irresponsible but it is not very far from the reality.
This is a genial product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a funny publicity dedicated to the mother who use the ticket (speak on the job or in bathroom) and they feel like "mucks".
His purpose is not to elogiate or judge the household industry."
At the end, video protagonists show that they have balled with the discreet ticket infiled in the reggisen.
The concept where the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the ticket feel like mucks.
However, Elvie ticket is completely silent, there is no fish or tubes and can be infiltred in a rhythm of a tattoo by giving to women the freedom of move, keeping children in arms, and even out when they take the latte.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: "The ticket Elvie is a totally revolutionary product that meets a huge and provocatory launch.
In paragoning the women who use the tickets to the muscles, we wanted to demonstrate all the disagreements of this practice showing in a funeral and easily recognisible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new ticket is able to ensure."
This is not the first time Elvie ticket made news.
During the week of London’s mode, the mother of two children was presented on the passenger of the style Marta Jakubowski indossing this product.
hundreds of migrants children have been moved silently into a tender to the borders of Texas
The number of migrants children has increased in spiral way even if the monthly transition of the borders have remained relatively invaded, in particular because the sustainable retorical and the political line of Trump's administration has become more difficult to admit these children.
Most of those who took them in confidence were in a kind of clandestin immigrants that now fear to put the opportunity to stay in the country offering to do such a gesture.
The risk is increased in June when the federal authorities have announced that the trusted potential and the other adult members of their family would be taken digital prints and that the data would be transferred to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high functionary near the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated before the Congress that the Agency has arrested tens of people who were offered to take care of only children.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no previous criminals.
"If 80% of people who are offered to be confident of children or belong to the families of these people are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminal men.
So we're still giving these people's shoes," says Albence.
In order to try to process the children quickly, the workers have introduced new rules for which some of them should compare in judgment within a month from the stop, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to what he says who works in the adoption points.
Many will be compared to video conference instead of persons, in order to deal with their cases of legal state at a judge for immigration.
Those who will be considered non-done to receive aid will be quickly exhausted.
Increasingly, children remain in confidence, much more risks of suffering of anxie and depression that cause violent attacks of rabbit or escape trials, according to their statement those who work in accommodation points and relations that are issued from the system in recent months.
Whoever supports this position says that the probability that it is still higher in a larger structure as the Tornillo in which, just because of its sizes, is easier than the children's disagreement signals are ignored.
They add that the movement of children in the tender without give them the time to prepare emotionally or to welcome friends might be able to achieve the trauma that many are already faced.
Syria encourages the US, French and Turkish employment forces to immediately remove
In his discussion to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of the Foreign Walid al-Moualem invited the Syrian prosecutors to return to the country even if the war is now come to eight years.
Moualem, who also recognizes the first minister's carcake, said that the foreign forces will occupy the Syrian land illegally with the presence of fighting the terrorism and "the future will be treated."
"They must be removed immediately without putting any conditions," he said before the assembly.
Moualem insisted on the fact that the "Terrorism fight has almost finished" in Syria, where there were more than 360,000 dead and million people have had to leave their houses since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue to "build this holy war until he will deliver all the Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "qualise of illegal presence".
The United States have about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are mainly advising and supporting the core forces and the Syrian Arabians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
In the problem of the prosperity, Moualem stated that the conditions are favorable to their return and accused "also west countries" to "include infected fears" who spend the benefits to be far away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he replied.
"What should be just a humanitarian problem is political."
The United States and the European Union have warned that in Syria will not be made aid for rebuilding until between Assad and the opposition will be achieved a political agreement that allows to end the war.
The United Nations diplomatics claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the constitution of a consistency area in Idlib, the last important rock forces of rebels, has created the opportunity to continue political treatments.
The Agreement between Russia and Turkey has evited an excessive attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the country, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, underlined that the Agreement has "precise extents" and expressed the hope that the military action has as objective of the Jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nousra-Fronte, connected to Al-Qaeda, that "the will be strayed."
The sentence of the United Nations Staffan of Mistura is hoped that you can immediately invite a new committee of the Government members and the opposition to hold a constitution bow for Syria's post-government and prepare the road for elections.
Moualem has expressed the conditions for the participation of the Government of Syrians to the Committee, saying that the works of the group should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Because Trump will add the second mandate
Based on this logic, Trump will be reselected in 2020 as if, as many free spectaculars may hope, its presidency should not be concluded priorly because of an emphasis or a scan.
In what it will be, without doubt, "the end of the most dramatic presidency forever!"
Now there are no signs of flexion of spectators.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night are more than rather than 1,05 million on CNN and almost triplicated to 1,6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has in the middle of 2,4 million spectaculars in first night, decided to increase 1,7 million years ago, according to Nisen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" program of the MSNBC has override the percentages of the network achieved 3,5 million spectaculars in the evening with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something of explaining," says Neal Baer, showrunner of the TV series of ABC "Designed Survivor" who tells the story of a member of the office that becomes unexpectedly president after a attack that destroys the campaign.
Nell Scovell, an expert of commedie brilliant and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi course in Boston before the elections of 2016.
The author told you he would vote for Trump.
You asked him why.
He replied, "Why do I sleep?"
So the caos is a source of fun.
Of course, in the absence of any other television program, the train of Washington's victoria can determine the future of the Judge Roe vs. Wade, if immigrants family can be gathered or less and the health status of the global economy.
However, to stop following the news is a luxury that only the most privileges can allow themselves.
However, it will be well more than its need of towns informed to follow for the sixth time a group of experts who discuss the low research of Bob Woodward for his book "Paura" of the struggle jack of 15,000 dollars of Paul Manafort (a full tracking industry) commented the Washington Post and the implications of the defect descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes parts of Trump.
For example, I can't see Super Mario anymore without thinking about us.
"Party of the reason that it seems to be a reality show is in the fact that every night there are news" states Brent Montgomery, delegated manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", on the approach of the actors and the journal developments of Trump's show (in contrast with N.F.L. that elegio Kim Jong-un).
You can't lose a episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north side of Kauai, and at least it was a sun day with about 30 degrees, was closed home to look at the MSNBC and recorded the CNN.
It was not able to get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh faced the Court of the Senate and before the future uncertain of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, "I remember when we made all these secure programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the West Civility."
"I thought it was a funny shit, but they were right."

External money influence in the corse for the most serrate elections of measuring half
It is not a surprise that in the 17th district it is achieved by the raising a congressive district that has done that two members are now in charge for the same place.
The recent redefination of the suburban district of Pittsburg, the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, which conquered its location in another district during a special election that has been held the last primaver.
Lamb is in the course against another loaded member, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, which now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that is override to the new 17th.
The maps were resigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January declared that in old districts, electoral colleges were incorruptionally managed for the Republicans.
The 17th district has scattered a campaign characterised by a feroisy opposition between the financial frameworks of the two major parties, including the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name known in Pennsylvania after a measuring victory in the special elections of March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The place was occupied by a republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump was added to the district for 20 points.
Political opinions gave demokratics a lot of advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then changed ideas.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Pechino, with a little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and the President Trump had also a hotel in Panama until the partners have reached the manager of the Trump Organization.
The officers of the State Department have decided to enter the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama after the "Recent decision to not recognize Taiwan" stated the portfolio of the Heather Nauert Department in a statement released at the beginning of the month.
However, the decision to apply sanctions was taken only in contrast to El Salvador, which in 2017 has received from the Americans about 140 million dollars of aid for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included tags for financial assistance and limits to access visa, would be concerned for the country of Central America with a high percentage of disemployed and murders.
After a series of internal meetings, the officials of North America and Central America rejected a high-center conference on security and economic prosperity to maintain a similar meeting that was seen as a step in trying to prevent migrants in the United States.
But at half September, the officials of the high-government were clear that they wanted to continue with the conference to renew so definitively to any sanction in the contrast of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was charged to predict the conference, now planned for half October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration applies to this meeting, confirming diplomatics.
And the three American sentences returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without receiving further mails of reproach or punishment from Washington.
A portfolio of Bolton to the White House refused to comment the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomatics which have allowed to speak, in anonymous form, of internal decisions.
How much they reported was confirmed by an external analysis near the administration that he wanted to keep anonymous.
Study the story
In the report that he will publish, the special officer Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of ostruction to justice, which seems to have enough evidence.
Instead of what it says, the research of Mueller wants to make light on the potential counsel of Trump with Russia during the Presidency campaign.
If the Congress had passed to democratic, Trump should answer these accusations before the electorers and may be a jury of its couples while prepared for a new candidate.
The unknowns are many, and I don't want to say that Trump's falling is inevitable, as it is not the one of its homologs in Europe.
In both of the Atlantic sponsors, we should make choices that will decide how much the battle can be able to do.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to organize a state fight against Hitler if western powers had stopped him and had supported the Czechoslovaquis in Monaco.
In that case, we failed to escape the opportunity to prevent the years of carbon that have followed it.
The currency of the history rounds around these points of progress in which the inheritable margin of democracy is accelerated or retard.
The Americans at the time have to face different.
What would happen if Trump decided to release the replacement general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the destination of Mueller's investigation?
The position of Rosenstein has been complicated since this journal has reported that the last year has secretly suggested to submit Trump to intercepts with doubt its ability to recover the role of President.
Rosenstein supports the news about the Times is not true.
"How will we respond if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or will be confirmed to the Supreme Court, unless the expected accusations of suffering and false testimony?
And in particular, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer his actions?
If we do not exceed these evidence, democracy will be prepared to face a long wind.
But the lecture I learned in Praga makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Hebrew Czechoslovak who was carried out to Auschwitz from the same Nazi system that once built my ambassador.
She survived, she moved to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to accompany the Saturday lamps with the swast.

Graham Dorrans der Rangers is a very optimist meeting with the Rapid Vienna
June, the Rangers will visit the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory on the Austrians, after the convinced convinced parliament against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them good opportunity to qualify for the G Group of Europe League.
Even if the center campaign Graham Dorrans has played his first game of the stage at the time of the 2-2 parking with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"To us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," he said the player triangle.
"We faced the convinced game to do well and we brought a point home.
Maybe we could win in extremely, but, all summary, the park is a right result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As regards the younger, it will be another greatest European night.
We hope to conquire the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our adversaries have received a good result in the last game. I'm sure, thanks to the support of the public, we can't delay.
The last year was certainly difficult because of my information and changes at the same club, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in the way, the boys are happy and the preparation is good.
So we can forget the problems of the last stage and think of the future."

According to official sources, at least 384 people have died after a strong earthquake, and a tsunami who has hit the Indian city of Paul. The budget of victims is destined to go up.
The communications are interrupted and the responsibilities of the resources were not able to have any information from the Government of Donggala, a northern area of Palu, which is near the epidemic center of the magnitude 7.5.

Pyongyang has not released public declarations.
At the extreme majority of the refugees of North Korea at the end, the South Korean citizenship is offered.
According to Seoul, more than 300,000 north-coreani have passed through illegally from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority escape through China, which is limited with North Korea, is more longer and easier to travel in respect of the democratized area (DMZ) strongly protected between both Korea.
China considers them illegal emigrants as refugees and often repaid them with strength.
The relations between North and South, which are still technically in war, are significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about negotiations on denuclearization that are in a steel situation.
This is after the story meeting June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to deliver the Korean penisole from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Ministry of North Korean Ri Yong-ho criticized the United States sanctions for the missing developments since then.
"No trust in the United States we cannot be certain of our national security and in these circumstances there is no possibility we go to the unilateral disarmament for the first," said Ri in a discussion to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh "sterical" and supports that is not adapted to the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority Nancy Pelosi defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "heroic" and says that it is not characterally appropriate to recognize that.
The Pelosi expressed this opinion on the Sabbath in a visit during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had been conducted in the same way, they would have defined it preciously," said the Pelosis on the statement that he was young from Kavanaugh before the Court of the Senate.
Visiblely emotionated Kavanaugh denied the accusation of having sexually troubled Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both adolescents.
At the beginning of his conversation, Kavanaugh was before emotion, so much to come nearly to urlar and with the egg stretched from the plant while he talked about her family and years to the high school.
He also condemned the democratics of the committee who have defined the accusations against him a "secured and coordinated disappointment campaign" organized by the free free freedoms because Hillary Clinton has lost the presidential elections of 2016.
The Perosis believes that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has demonstrated that he was prevented against the democratic.
"I think he was auto-exclusive with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and Democratics," he said.
The Pelosi then solved a obedience when it was asked if Kavanaugh will try to put in case of accusation, and if the democratic should be achieved to the majority of the Representatives room.
"I think if the truth doesn't say to the Congress or the FBI, it is not only adjusted to the Supreme Court, but even for the court that now is present," said the Pelosis.
Kavanaugh is at the time a judge of the Court of Applause for the Circuit of Columbia District.
The Pelosis added that, as democratic, it is concerned for the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In the audience for its confirmation, Kavanaugh chose questions about his intentions to reduce certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Pelosis stated that "No one can send a desirable person and partly to the Supreme Court and suggest that this decision will be accepted positively."
And women have to use it.
It's a right diatribe, months and years of wrath attacks from which you can't go out without weeping.
"We're kidding when we're drowned," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And he continued, "It was very helping me a woman who was leaving somewhere, and she said that she was also weeping when she was hungry, but she developed a technique so that when she was hungry and began to cry to say to the person with whom she talked, "I could think I'm sad because I'm weeping.
But I'm angry."
And then he continued.
I thought her was a brilliant idea."
The lacrimes are tolled as a shooter of the rabbit in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of the most neighbors remembering I have a previous job in a office in a mass prevalence is the same when I was sent to cry for a rabbit access. A more old woman than me, a glass manager from which I was always been very lately terroristed to me for the colt and cut off the scale.
"Don't let you see weeping," he said.
"It doesn't know you're wrestling.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his course to the President.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business was discovered the extracognigal report of Hart, which had to renew the corse, Schroeder, very depressed, thought there was no reason why she would not have been trying to change herself for the President.
"In fact, it wasn't a very ponderated decision," he said to me, "It wasn't a good decision."
"There were already seven other candidates in the course, and it wasn't sure to serve another one.
Someone defined them "Biancaneve and the seven girls."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with the fund collection, and he sweared that it would not be candidate if she hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a loss cause.
He concluded that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 would have data only 250.
"They think I can get a shock?" he asked.
When he had the discussion to announce that he would not have launched a official campaign, he was totally supervised by the emotions (gratitude for people who had supported it, delusion to the system that would make more difficult to find money and electors as representatives and rabbits for the sexual discrimination of which it was victim), which he had committed.
"It seemed to be pretty nervous," remembered Schroeder thinking about the print reaction.
"Anyone could think that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember I thought what they would write on my stone.
Maybe "Pyysen very."
In how the US-China trade war could favor Pechino
The offence of the trade war between the United States and China has been fragorous and, while the battle is entirely else, the experts say that a contrast between both countries may be advantaged for Pechino for a long period.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including the sun panels, the acid and the aluminium.
The most significant estimation has been accomplished this week with the new investments on articles for more than 200 billion dollars (175 billion euro), which means that it will be applied on half of the Chinese ventures.
Pechino reacted every time with measures of the same type by applying recent taxes from five to 10 per cent over 60 billion dollars of US merchants.
China has promised to respond to the United States on the smoke, and it is impossible that the second larger economic power of the world will be quickly turned back.
Because Washington renews, it would have to take up to its requests, but publicly to the United States would be too immense for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts think that if Pechino plays well his cards, the pressures of the trade war with the United States may be positively influenced on China in a long period reducing the interdependence of both economys.
"The fact that a quick policy decision of Washington or Pechino can create the initial conditions of a economic collapse in both countries is very dangerous than that has been yet recognized," supports Abigail Grace, a researcher who studys Asia in the New American Security Center Center.

But they played better than us."
