Camille Auer wanted to correct his family, the diagnósite, and now he's going to make a question -- "The man should have the right to be his own room."
The room gallery of the photographical project has ten patients injured.
Everyone of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell the many-year history of how external people have writed up their origin from Auer and this identity.
They finished him who he is.
"I wanted to tell a person about my personal treatment history, so that the violence of the process should be visible," said Auer.
In the process, he refers to a generation correction process.
It is often a durable study period of years with psychology, psychiatry, treatment and doctors.
The process will be started by sending the "Abortion of Scope IDs" to the diagnostic studies that are carried out in Tampere and Helsing.
The process was started four years ago in Auer.
Before this, he had used its sterogenic situation through the Internet and was still very long in its own correction process.
She tried to be a woman, but, according to the Summary law, the person must continue to correct the process, so that the family can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, or the law of the transsequence of the sual family (563/2002), is responsible for transsects people to the packaging sterilisation, in order to reach the right family, for example, to the national registry and pass.
At this time, each generation will be corrected from each generation required by psychiatric diagnosis and proof of increasing independence.
Humans have the right to decide on their own counsel.
"This situation is increasing and disappointing human rights," says Auer.
The translation renovation has been spoken for a long time in Sweden.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has provided a law of eight notices, and in the European Human Rights Court, there is a pre-determined decision that commits the parties of the European Human Rights Agreement to maintain self-decreasing rights.
The previous Government prepared a change of the legislation by the Minister Susanne House of Social and Health.
The ships came, and the Peruumians rose up to government.
Now the law change is once again.
It is an internal policy disagreement that doesn't even agree to this law.
"Halleting does not want to lead it to the table because there are distinctiveness in the government on the change of the law," says Amnesty's Officer Frank Johansson.
The priority of the presentation shall control two large installations.
One of them is formed of the packages and the uses of Aure.
In the installation of patients, any passenger can read, for example, from Auer of the Universal Health of Tampere.
Psychology met Camille Auer two times and wrote on the basis of these reports that should determine the treatment of Auer and help.
Research realistic understanding seems to be cut off to the bottom.
Research treatment seems to be highlighted by a limited and personality.
Auer didn't recognize himself of these pictures.
"It's serious to hear that I'm a diagnóstic hospital," Auer says.
There was still a greater arrangement when Auer has not been granted to a family correction.
According to the Agency of Management, his power was not sufficient to start the process.
He was prohibited his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer went out of the meeting and struck the transpolis' expected television.
After this TV, the tadeteos was named Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who has been born as a woman can increase his breast, but to remove the fractions needs diagnosis," Auer says.
Your cohesion is not your own, if you're trying to be different than the number defined in your generation.
The experience of the air is not the only quality.
The stage correction process is more precisely human reasons than purely for medical operations.
They will meet ten people who need to be based on their own place and justify their own family.
"I'm insane that people who are supporting and helping are needed to treat the waters that they don't have enough of their power," said Auer.
Many processes have been searched after psychic origin: exploitation, anguishment, possible pressure costs.
The treatment of these waters may be determined that the treatment cannot be started.
"Behavior and helping can eat people in a worst situation than what it was before starting the process," said Auer.
The proper view of the air is also involved in suffering and thoughts of self-sexuality.
In the text of the display, Auer writes: "I have been self-controlled thoughts of all my growth, and it is what people generally are difficult to arise."
The disease has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it was easy.
He was able to say the knowledge that had already been in the child and the teini.
That is why the wide lake was not recognized to be appropriate for its own bow, and why the bread of the flesh had to be rotated in place of the grain.
The most important Auer has been that he's near him is people who see him.
The future is based on the point.
"In the evening it's gonna be based on so much by speaking, speaking, sounding and moving," she says.
Today, Auer's already trying to see the future, she's a woman.
However, in the beginning of the process, the complaints of the neighbourhoods could have been a lot of suffering.
Better, it hurts when the neighborhoods are coming.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't agree or can enter it," he continues.
However, all transients do not have physical changes.
They have not suffered the cheody forefather or the chechoristy integrity in which the hair or parts can cause suffering and even physical skins.
However, without the use of hormones and long-term research process cannot be officially strengthened by their own generations.
"There are no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
For example, the Parliament adopted in Denmark in June 2014 to recognize the new legal generation procedure.
The new legislation is based on self-decreasing rights on the legal generation.
The full-year-old investigator makes a literal question on the new personality reporting that his experience is another generation.
After a fourth year, the applicant confirms his question, and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personality.
This self-determination right is also required for Swedish and this requirement to include the Aure's display.
It was not a threatener, but the show is a political and technical technology.
I want to believe that there is still a pregnancy and that it can be helped to get political changes during the time that politicians have forgotten human rights.

The National Rights Organization has granted a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP Agency, which carried out African Civil Rights, has provided the Missouri travel warning, and the State party has violated the practices and racism actions occurred there.
"The traveling information on the Missouri NAACP shall be made in force on 28.8.2017, and it is designed by African travellers, visitors and local interests in particular attention and maintaining extreme care in the country that has recently been achieved in the report of the Organization.
In Missouri, the law that has been able to be able to export the rights of serious debts, and the implementation of the State party is also increasingly reduced in relation to minority. According to NAACP, these points are led to the provision of the travel warning.
"The human citizen rights are lost.
They are stopped on the basis of the smoking color, and they are disappointed or killed," NASACP President of Missour Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We haven't heard of a lot of cases in a short time."
The travel information on Missouri is a warning on the first party of the United States.
The organization mentioned, for example, the racial comments present against African students in the University of Missur and Tennessee's 28-year-old Tory Sanders' death.
Sanders died in the circumstances before this year, and he was in time to go through the country when his car ended the fire.
In the transmission information, the Ministry of Missouri was also mentioned to the statement of the police to stop the Black Transporter's 75% more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the Communication is to encourage people to be convinced and to warn their families, their friends and workshops about what can happen in Missour," says Chapel.
"For example, humans must be prepared by taking money for the payment of the tax or telling to the family that they are going to travel through the country."
The FBI says that it was written in Missour in 2015 of hundreds of branches or of sixty of most of the United States parties.
It is also responsible for the new law of Missouri, which is difficult to explore enterprises in the rights of living and working relationships.
The ACLU ACLU system, which has recently granted traveling warnings to Texas and Arizona after they have accepted agricultural changes which are committed to the police to maintain the human agricultural committees.
In general, traveling warnings publishes the Foreign Ministry, and other States, but the citizens have been published in the last time to the answer to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Algebra: Lintya requested Finair's advancement for the advancement of the leader of the officer
Mika Lintila (center), responsible for the State's owner, has requested Finair Airport Leader of Pekka Vauramo to reach the additional expenses, generally reported.
According to the Ministry, it is a crisis with the national desire.
In this week, 130 000 euros advanced in this week when Helsing's Words were published about the payment of the leaders of the party.
More Photoshop was published from Vauramo's additional fever in February.
Finair reported his advancement in 2013.
The State is worth that additional resources are not used to pay.
The State's owning more than half of the Finairs.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the primary decision on the proposal of the last year.
The packages packed out once
Any time ago, he showed that the relations between the United States and the Russian relations were on the road of hungry to dark.
In the connection with the G20-country of industry in Hampur, the United States President Donald Trump and the Russian President Vladimir Put appeared in the future.
Then the tunnel has been noticed.
The U.S. Congress last weekly accepted and Trumpe signed to new economic packages in Russia.
The response of the carrier is secondly heard of the Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedevi, which says that the Trumpin signed package means "a deficit trade war."
Although Russian reactions were only to be carried out in the political retory and override, the crushing between the United States and Russia is actually after the short month of the Trumpin election.
In the United States, there was no simple passengers on Russia, Ireland and North Korea.
The Congress accepted a single law, but the adoption of the law to the President was noticed in accordance with awareness.
Trump's criticism is also manufactured to sign the law "indetermined".
The relationship with the threat of the President Trumpin was particularly caused to Russia, although its own rights to be restricted to the law that has been restricted.
As well recognised, we are going to investigate in the United States so that the Russian potential forward to the Chairman's Championship of the Russian campaign Trumpin.
The excursion between the United States and the Russian is actually after a short month.
When the White House has changed several and different scandinalar transactions have been discovered in a period of time, it is still clear that the external policy does not make the president in the United States, but not the president.
That's not what you're doing in the name.
If the Russian Relationship is a chemical in the United States, it is also the same to the European Union.
Furthermore, the Economic Economic Economic Economic Committee has also been rejected in the Union's Union's Union's Union's inner area to cover relations.
The EU has seen that Ukraine’s situation has been presented in Russia and requested the implementation of the Agreement of Minsk.
Although the Union has remained secondly in the Russian policy, at least the primary half, the Member States' interests are particularly different.
As a group of Russians, a lot of trade to the membership, economic packages have been real.
The effects on the U.S. field are still inadequate.
In the EU, it was afraid that the packagings will come to avoid the activity of many European enterprises.
The major effects may be, for example, feel in the North Stream 2 challenges project and possibly in the Fennovian social project.
The ability in Europe has noted that for example, for example, the EU's economy has been left outside of the packaging.
The citizens are the way the world's political way to demonstrate the worst.
However, economic packagings must be very valuable and careful.
Others are easily more difficult than benefits.
Isn't there any more holy?
Trumpin White House is now in the plane of freedom
It's most sure that the destruction is a sign of the governance.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqians lost together with American soldiers, Saddam Hussein in the Firdos' opening in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Thumpin Government Chief Ideologists, knew well what he had done in the detail with Jim Acostan in the CNN.
Miller didn't usually appreciate himself.
If he had done this, he would have obtained a great plot from the organisations of risks and of the freedom's immorality.
His avoid was a significant significance, and especially that in 1903 his feet were added to Emma Lazarus’s floor – 17 years after the preparation.
So, Miller said, "I don't want to go to the story now, but the freedom is the symbol of the world of the American freedom.
Runo was added later, and it is not the original freedom ship."
Miller wasn't wrong with you, but it's not just about history as he said himself.
Of the elephants are the words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the country is not only called the poor men, but "The poor ones": "Your tired, your poor, / Your famous masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
Now, it's more timely than ever.
Miller didn't exceed the literature crisis, but he made clear that "poor poor" is not healthy to the United States.
As regards the significance of the freedom, it is a part of the most largest political and cultural interest in the importance of the United States.
After his death, the Lazarus’s friends campaigned, because of the smoking of his feet, and they knew well that it was political.
The objective was to explain a French and America's integrity connections with a classical explanation, a freedom of women's body.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in his lot of female is no abstract anymore, but there is a voice.
And it gives himself a new name: the mother of the crazy mother.
It was a neuro-feminist government and a destruction of the American National Assembly.
Lazarus has changed the significance, and the jurisdiction has already wanted to change it to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a director that can now have a prophecy from Trump – stated in 2010 that the Freedom Path does not offer any call, but it is a former advantage of the godly Conservatives who brings the United States to cover the darkness into the world: "Lady Liberty is present.
He brings freedom from the United States to the other world.
The challenge doesn't show the way to the United States."
That's a lot, Limbaugh was part of the right.
The significance of freedom is totally depending on the visibility.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and renewed, but the hopes of the landscape of the long and experienced road.
He saw it protected and better from the view of people who looked for life.
His freedom will be satisfied by giving hope and hope for health.
And that Miller and Trump don't want any case.
They don't show the way, but they move anger moves, their only power will be gone.
MM-contributions 2017: Neil Black lists the school members of Ison-Britannian
Eile Doyle remembers the time when only two Scotlands came to Ison-Britannian
Ison-Britania Officer Neil Black says that 16 scotch members of the World Meeting Conference Agriculture are "excellent confirmation".
During a period of MM-contingents in London, the MM concurrents have been chosen forward numbers of schools.
Black says that in Scotland "I'm going to happen something special," from which Ison-Britania's office should be learned.
"This is welcome, and we continue to investigate it so long that we understand what's the question," Black says.
"I discussed with the representatives of the Institute of Scotland, and they believed that it was involved in the activities of the institution.
The officer of Scotland again believes that it is involved in the action of the agreement,
And Ison-Britania's officer believes that it's their work.
And a regular passenger thinks he needs to have something to do with the matter.
But there's something very amazing about what it's going to be."
Many sculptors competite in London in real medals, others, Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, which concurrent with Sir Mo Farah with 50,000 meters. For Eilida Doyle was chosen as Captain of Agriculture.
"It's a lot of vacation.
His captain's talk was amazing," Black says.
"The urgents have gone out of the opportunity to get honourable and strongly motivated, except where they are disappointed to dwell and explore.
In the words of Eildh, it was the best to know and to disappoint the urgency."
Eiligh Doyle is a argental cycle of 400 meters, and these are its five world community concurrency. He thinks that it's a "commandation" that in the country's 16-year-old scoots.
The previous preview was seven years of 1983 and 2015.
The Middle East Laura Muir has been raised for five years in Ison-Britanian and two European preventions.
He concurrs in London 1 500 meters and 50,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 meters in London. He also can be able to keep the eye: a man has a wonderful longer behind the Ison-Brittann's MM and the Anniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembered the first world's concurrency, when the only fields in the land were Lee McConnell.
The Captain of Agriculture says that it's a "except honour" that it is so many scotts that concurrent in real financial places and medals.
"Come to be a greater honor, but more particularly it is because the members of the lands have voted to the captain," Doyle says.
Of course, I'm very happy of all the shoes that came to the ground.
It shows how long we've got.
They're with them as an urgent officers who concurrent of payments.
Captain's talk?
I think it was good.
I focused on how happy we are when we have homes.
It is important to enjoy the support of a household and that we are again in the olympian.
I'll get another opportunity in there and I know that the aircraft will be a greater thought."
Prohibition of evaluators in Facebook: Don't be established to the proposal for a public error if you do not get criticism
Our country's father knew what's bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the statements began to appreciate him soon from all the possibility of the political house, always to its political principles.
Critically, it's sure.
But he didn't shut up his officers.
"If the freedom of speaking is removed, we will be able to lead to a fool and silently as a sheep struggling," said Washington in 1783.
We're going to go to Larry Hogan's council of Maryland, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's person has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and presented their comments.
The United States citizen rights committed Hogan's right before this week.
His personality needs to be able to disagree, and the relationship was also increasingly in the network.
"What about? This is just Facebook," many comments.
But it's important,
especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is a democratic representative of the Democratic Democratic Democratic Republic.
He has received its action to another best assessments between 50 counselors.
Hogan doesn't have a react for the moon.
He has led the party firmly and has been strictly closed with the principles.
He also used Facebook as part of the main connection of his voters and published there in the chemotherapy of chemotherapy.
That is why the defense of users that come to the Facebook page is not necessary and even dangerous. The community page is a public and official phoomenon that his personal supports funds.
The Hogan's reporter, Amelia Chasse, made the communist activity to Washington Post in a disagreement, and it was only about the commentary.
Commanders, however, are too easy to be resolved as throne, slower or hate.
Washington Post disappeared users in Hogan's Facebook.
They were common to people who wanted to discuss with their leaders, and they were not thrones, but, for example, teachers, employers and pastors.
They told them that their comments were honorable, precious, and business.
The priest wrote in his comments of the Bible; he wanted to guide the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Agency Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not an enemy but reported the question about the mistake.
"My counsel was obviously convinced that Hogan had not taken the ship to the news and the last news," he wrote in the new comments of Washington Post.
"I can also accept that when many people have commented the same thing, they will immediately be organized in some kind of way and will be raised into a large group of concerned citizens."
The Commissioner's person called comments "increasingly attractive." Someone could invite them to improve important matters.
The message is easy to rule in the time of Facebook by preventing values or to remove critical comments.
Before the age, it should have been sent to persons to explore and burn a newspaper that had published critical literature, or to keep and keep the interesting addressers.
However, it is actually the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official, which has been accused by Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trumpin, Twitter users have violated him in the right.
The first significant decision was given in Virginia last week.
According to the Court of Alexandria, James C. Cacheri, the Government of the Loudouan Department has denied the first advancement of the United States in the Facebook voter.
And the connection with the US citizen rights was discussed by the Republic of Kentucky with Matt Bevin's Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In the previous posts in Washington, there were similar effects as on the internet today.
The number of sanomaleties was neonlineated from 1776 in 1800, and the unnamed writers were cutting up Washington.
There's been trolls that time.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belizeria and Porcius wrote letters in which they wanted the decisions of Washington.
The Chairman's office has come to the conventions in which Jay has evaluated the Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom of cooperation, trade and sea agreement, which includes the documentation of the George Washington Network Project.
But he didn't shut up his accountants.
The vocational freedom, the mental freedom, and the debate freedom is our nation's fundamental.
The real leadership means the acceptance of this.
In the middle of the lines, it's reason to stop immediately
The shows have come from the same half of the places, and also the net reports of the couple, three.
Most of them have come from the South and Eastern and Watch Tower, but then also individuals from Hapavede and Seíjoel, special researcher Marja Isomursu reports about Every.
The tricomonous names are dead in a tricomon.
It is a scientist named Trichomonas gallinae.
It's known for the first time, and especially on the wood.
However, 2000-year-year-old steams were also covered by peippolyne.
In 2009, he was very well.
Then my tricomomonous had a big role in the Sweden box, after which the weapons have been able to live.
Diseases have now been, but not at least in the middle of the majority, the natural media of Helsing University (Luumus) museums representative Juha Honka says.
It is afraid that the previous epidemy of the virus is renewed to do something.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that can do everybody: to stop the middle of the ships immediately.
More about the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for their home resources in Renaissance Club
The first European Union player Ronan Rafferty hopes for the use of the household of the following three days when Renaissance Club in East-Lothian orders 25.
The North-Irland Rafferty led to Archerfield Links in the last year in the neighborhood of Archerfield Links, a turning ordered before the last round, but finally lost Paul Eales. Rafferty was raised to a new place and worked the turn for Jerry Sarvard's officer.
"I followed the Construction of Renaissance Club, and after this event, it's going to be completely fulfilled," says Rafferty.
"The fields will see the best field, it's fine.
Jerry has done a good job with this place.
He's the most famous messenger, and he's the honour of his time here.
Turns are a great presentation field."
The English Eales is the first of the first time, although he has wined 32-year-old rooms, and the European Circuit and the European Depression Area.
"This feels a very special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I'm not going to cut out the Extremadura Open's winning because the turn isn't in this year.
You're good back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of the last year return to the mind: the turn was a good thing to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we're always going to remember."
Gary Orr returns to his own country, and he went back to the citizens for 50 years ago.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since 2013, Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"The playing in the house is always more common in Helensburg," says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed, but you also know more pressure.
I've enjoyed the game again and played the time strongly.
I'm happy for my game here."
Third day, Ian Woosnamin and the chief chairmans, Paul Broadhurstin, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNultyn.

The air has been able to look like a wonderful, Holma's real.
Poverty and death in the gold of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a dinner.
I mean, she's just gonna use a lot.
Degei lives in the field of Enrotali, in the capital city of the Panama, which is located in the Indian province of Papua. When he prepares a day, he usually puts the bath - locally "note" – directly to the town.
During a half hour, he returned to the carrier, and he eats a lot of smooth, and he was in the hands of the bottom.
There are no rooms in the Dege's house, and he sits in a different landing where he usually treats his daily grounds, as if he asks to be close to the pitch in the water.
The office of the office brings the room in the missing room.
Degei is the youngest man of four wifes, and he has not been determined to be treated.
The multiple is here. It's general.
Later, work may be dangerous: the largest part of the men of the skin is employed, and many drinks are very much, and there is also to take care of the soldiers.
"Nobody's walking in the ground after five nights," Degei says.
This is a serious cutting in the architecture of Papua, in the previous Holland transmission country, which was added to Indonesia in 1969. The front of the preliminary citizens in which the price of 1 026 cigarettes was declined to vote publicly before the Member States.
The Government of the Holland rebelled the local self-security traveled quickly to the Jacarta Government, which keeps the area hardly in its management and disappears the head of external officers and human rights.
In 2003, the province was held officially to Papua and West Papua. The East Saar is the Papua New Guinea.
The Enrotali is a serious and cold. It's going to start a half-hour air from the capital city of Jaipur to Nabire and continues to walk in the ground of five hours in the town of the town.
There's no public transport here.
Almost 19,000 residents in the city have the grounds of bambuatic rooms where the alcohols are colored as horizons.
Only severe Indian has come here, without talking about manufacturers and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries come to Papuun Mee Pago, they worshiped the god of Uga Tamee.
Other changes have happened.
"We haven't had such clothes," Degei said, "it means a color, a hand made by the steel of the smoke, a smoke and a brilliant puzzle.
"Now we had only a magazine of our garages."
Papua is the most poor provincies of Indonesia. 28 per cent of its residents live under the poor field, and children's integrity and dishonestness are the most highest Asian.
But it's also Indian gold.
The Pania is the entire area of New Jersey, where there is 153 000 inhabitants. Only one hundred kilometres from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most of the world of gold. It owns the Freeport McMoran company, where the home place is in the United States.
In 2015, the chew was produced for Freeport 3,1 billion dollars of gold and coppers.
Furthermore, Papua has 78 billion dollars' branches.
However, these riches of the priesthood are worthy of corruption, because they mean the prevention of the strong army of Indonesia.
New York Times explained in 2005 that Freeport was paid to the local military persons and military units for about 20 million dollars in 1998–2004. For individuals, it was paid to $15,000.
The requirements of the greatest self-determination rights cause this source, and they change mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian Armies have been killed over 5000,000 pioneers after 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, in the 1970-year-year-old rate of national murders were assembled in the oversight of Papua's households.
In the last year, the police of Indonesia held more than 3 900 people in peaceful minds.
In the report of the Brisbane architecture report, We Will Lose Everything, 2016, is reports of the previous annual publications, such as practices without jurisdiction, excuses, excuses and electricity, are particularly recommended ways – and incompatible use of peaceful interests.
"The calculation of the victims is hard because the cases are a weekly," says Andreas Harson, Human Rights Watch Officer of Indonesian.
Rows are cut off when the Papua's natural branches are disturbing changes from other Indians.

"Mans have started to sell a cana and enemies in the torch more than local," says Abeth You, 24-year-old, who's home from Pania, and has changed the province's capital town through the work.
"The local women lost their client."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo – a lonely named Jokowi – has promised that in the campaign of 2014 there was an injustice in Papua and human rights committees.
Papua is 29th regions, and this ex-government has wind the vote in 27 regions, including in Poland, to the Chairman of Jacarta.
But it's just a little changed to Papu, and local feelings are cut off.
"We were courageous because we voted to Joko in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our hope and to return justice," says you.
Pania was tested only two months after the local officials of James.
One-year-old children were singing decades at the end of Enarotal 7.12.2014, when the dark appeared from two Indian soldiers with motor piolers.
The kids who feared said to the soldiers that these should be used for time.
The other soldiers didn't have a notice, but, according to the local shepherd Yavedt Teba, a man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of officers and witnesses, the soldiers who had drinked took kids in pieces, and they had cut off these challenges.
Then one of the soldiers shoot the kids.
One of the kids, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, struggled to follow the destruction.
A couple of hours later, the construction of the state’s aircraft was covered with fire, and the next day began to happen.
Thus, thousands of priests — young men and women, and children – were gathered together to the local policy and military commands to require justice.

"The part of the crimes happened a long time ago,
At the beginning of the 1990s and the 2000s.
The most important is that we have decided to investigate crimes, but we need some processes," he said.
In the discussion of the TIME Report in Jakart 5.6.2017, Viranto has already changed his mind, and he said that he didn't try to start the discovery with Papua.

My Pania has always been the problem of the Government of Indonesia.
The real development tree eats unfortunately in the Mee-, Moni-, Danish and Damal houses who live in the middle-lengths of Papua.
Many have been associated with Papua’s Liberation (OPM), the capital military army, which declares the rights of the priesthood to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be achieved by the hosts of Indian army.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Pacific, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
Armies have been responsible for holding and arresting thousands of people in Panama in the name of "the Security of the National Sovereignty".
Some of the arrested will never return back.
In the middle of the Papuians, Pania is known as "surious, forgotten."
The poor eat is unfortunate.
In the Enerotal, it's only a little river, and it's too a lot to the local,
Like the bread.
Humans grow their food themselves: beats and some grain fruits and magazines.
Women's work, and one woman's responsibility may have four or five bathrooms.
The largest part of the hundreds is for the family, and the ends are sold in the tours.
Only 100,000 rupes (75 cents).
Time after a number of local and changers have grown, and the number of changers has grown after the opening new repository to the Nabira Airport.
Works are a little, and they usually go to local better educated and careful changes.

The Serious Papua remains in the world for a little attention.

In March six of the Tyrney Sea State – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshal Saar and Solomon – promoted the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the "Clues and widely exciting crimes", also on the Peninsula.
These countries have also been submitted to the Liberal Court of Papua.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmantha Nasir urged the crimes and told the informors in Jarcat that "Indonesia is still a democracy, where there is a freedom, so the defense of the evidence of human rights should be disappointed."
The local governments want to miss the matter.

Indonesia there are presidents in 2019, but the priests say that they are not sure of Joko's vote.
"Anybody means good, but in his area there are people who have been attached to the struggle of Pania," says the President of the Chairman Council Gobai.
He wants to know the situation of the pioneers of Jacob: they live under the power of an unexpected army in the destruction and poverty, useless health services and opportunities for education.
According to Goba, the panians, as well as the other priests, keep the voice of the "man", which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Without the warning and fear, the victims of the Penian's bombing victims still indicated that they had been able to respond to clearly: they entered one of the victims of the police and military officers to the front of the country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes.

In the United States, more than 20 % of aircraft aircrafts takes the required requirements in accordance with the connection, explains the question investigation
The question of the aircraft investigation shows that over 20 % of the travellers in the United States had been prohibited or not known to the aircraft controls of the United States. At least six per cent of the travellers have been carried out or in other areas which they have not known to be prohibited.
All one percent reported to their gain afterwards that they had been mistakenly transported weapons, explosions or explosions.
The question replied over thousands of travellers, and it realized Stratos Jet Charters. The results also show that young travellers are able to rule others more likely.
The rules of the ECSA of 19.7% of the criminal travellers were representatives of the Y-generation and below 15% of the X-generation.
Most generally, the rules were violated in the airport with food and fish.
More than three per cent of your authorisation, the products provided in the airport are not informed, and 2,2 per cent of women and 3,7 per cent of men reported to the aircraft that they were prohibited to the aircraft.
The question was involved by travellers from various half the United States, and the company made the question wanted to figure out how many secretary products had been carried out in danger and how many had been done so clearly.
It is not surprised that most travellers also bring secretariats to the most probable security assessment – clearly or unknown.
However, as the company has done the fact, the TSA guides are especially multiple and amazing.
The travellers often don't know what this is going to the airport and how much.
It is therefore not surprised that the largest part of the TSA's backwaters are steels.
Sometimes there was a rule, also, I thought it couldn't be brought to the airport books.
They can bring them home to the air, but not to international air.
President Scott Pruitt, on the U.S.A., turned his decisions to reduce the decisions made by Obama's ship to reduce the restrictions
The day after the 15 Parts of the United States had discovered the EPA on the right of Scott Pruitt, Pruitt had finished his previous decisions to ensure the decisions that were made by Obama's Government, the restrictive decisions to reduce the decisions.
The amendment shows that its officer takes more old management in consideration of the needs of decisions responsible for the environmental agencies of States.
Pruitt was not mentioned by a word, which had been undertaken by its previous decision in the conventions of the State.
The Member States should begin to maintain the requirement of the country heading from 2015 beginning 1.10.
Pruitt reported in June that he moved the decisions for a year forward, so that its office has more time to plan, because the Office "not wants to miss the local decision or to deal with the economic growth."
Pruitt was a general accuser of Oklahoma, before President Donald Trump named him as Leader of the EPA. Pruitt is recognised as a rebellioner of the environmental rules.
After the outcome of Washington, Pruitt has tried to stop or exceed the decisions on the decisions of the resistance of chemicals and fossiles.
The draft change of the Middle Week is the last end of Pruitt plan to enhance rules.
In the last month of the United States in Washington, the Court of Communities adopted a decision that, in view of the superintendency of the EPA, the Governor of the EPA tried to reduce the decision of Obama's Government, the decision was responsible for the following and reducing meta-year-years.
In the Middle Wednesday, Pruitt stated that its full rules were only ensuring cooperation with the EPA parties in a variety of processes in which the objective was to fulfil the new requirements in accordance with the period.
"In the latter governments, the EPA often failed to observe the periods, and then expected that the active groups and others should be disappeared to the rights in which the agreement is achieved from the timeline," said Pruitt.
"We don't believe through judicial acts to the regulation and our relationship with the provisions seriously.
We are seriously agreed to the Regulation on our action and to the rights to us."
However, the EPA stated that Pruitt could continue to use the "decreasing decisions and other legal rules" to ensure that the rules are "based and based on the best information available."
The Republicans are in the Congress more changed in the office rules.
The objective of the legislation adopted in the last month is to exceed the implementation of decisions in 2015 at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the senates.
In this week, the EPA's general accuser Eric Schneiderman reported that the group would continue to continue.
"Our opinion of the EPA is to be a significant winning for 6,7 million newspapers and over 115 million Americans who are raised to the major impacts of the shipment in the Community," said Schneiderman.
Furthermore, New York was in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Colombia.
The country's heading is born, for example, cars, powers, olive plants and chemicals react to the airlight of the sun.
Thus, the born suffering may cause strong spiritual rights to human groups, and it is also part of thousands of previous deaths for years.
The representatives of the national health and environmental controllers enjoyed the surprising change of Pruitt.
"It's worried about how much good it has been required to use the guy responsible for our spiritual health," says Lori Ann Burd's biological multiformity center.
"We must also fight Thumpin's governance, because it is the ideal objective to act in the proposals of the groups in the frontiers and others."

The President of the U.S. sent you to Neto about that it was broken in the wall project publicly. "You can't say so to the review," said Trump.

Georgian blood foundation: Activists have re-lavaged racism in the hope of the jurisdiction
Ford Mercury - a car is able to explore the town in Monroe's small town in Georgia and continue to travel to the small Moore's Ford street.
In the car there are four black travellers and white travellers. Four armed men supported the way before the car came to it.
The leader of the juice, a middle-year-old man, takes the heart of life and smokes through the wind.
They're scared.
"Roger, n--u-u" a man's smoking.
Out of the car!
The smokes reject silence when a young black man is leaving out of the front.
This serious event is happy only a re-re-re-re-signed reported on 22.7.2017.
However, the observations of the exploitation are the initiatives when the rubber rings to the "Roger".
Human rights organizations have been returned from 2005 to Moore's Ford to launch the events of 1946. So, Ku Klux Klan ran two black parks, Roger, Dorothy Malcom and George Murray Dorsey.
Nobody has been struggled by murdering.
"I'm surprised that no one has been held in these years, although murders live among us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps renewing arrangements.
"It's a story crazy, but before all it's back that presses our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old citizenship active and an old Georgian Congressman.
It also reminds the inhabitants of Monroe that the fault has never been corrected.
"We want the crimes to come to justice, and we want to get things to be done to the decision, and we want to help the worst and to do the covenant, but before all we want the right," says Brooks.
"We can't help and do agreement before we get right."
Deadly investigators cover the blood of Georgia on 27.7.1946.
According to the news of NBC, the FBI documents have been exceeded over 50 men from Monroe and the environmental tickets.
Yet, no one has been accused of murder.
Although the crimes have been free for ten years, the activity, according to the active motives of the smoking, have been all the local knowledge: political and sex.
In 1946, the Government of Georgia had the most highest legal decision to vote first in the President's challenges. The highest right gave its decision in April, and the challenges were held within the midst.
According to the FBI, there was an interference in which a black steward Roger Malcom broke a white landing Barnett Hestery in the ground that appeared to be the wife of Malcom Dorothy.
According to Brooks, Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy waited for this child.
According to the FBI information, Loy Harrison, an impactable white agricultor paid 600 dollars from Malcom's prison 25.7.1946.
At home, Malcom and Dorothy followed their shirts Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The shooter stopped their car before Moore's Ford's shooting.
"It appeared that Harrison's status and organized murders" was proved in the FBI's report.
"It is also clear that the party and the local authorities were secreted, and the authorities were partly murdered and destroyed evidence and didn't declare the personality of the witnesses."
Brooks's showing it more comfortable.
"It was a voice-right killer," he said.
"They were killed because the black-shirts wanted to tell them that they're going to do the same if they're trying to vote."
Cassandra Greene has led to the Georgian blood review for nearly ten years.
The proposal is extremely realistic and prisoner, and it is a description of a serious race that many would like to believe in this day of the United States.
The proposal is difficult to look at it, but it is still difficult to notice what Green is in accordance with the purposes of Green.
"We don't want to talk about smoking because we're going to go to our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or you don't want to hear what I'm going to try."
The proposals of this year started in June. The first day, at least 30 displayers — ten black and twenty whites — were gathered to hear the Greece's broken relationship with the proposal.
Wade Marbaugh works with Green's officer.
He has submitted a local Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always a very difficult and contrast.
"He'll come a lot, because I'm not myself," said Marbaugh.
"But it's important that this half of this story will be presented, so that it's never again."
On the other hand, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
He's increasing that Hester has a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear?" I said you're out of my mail, n-u-u."
Rascona Hester's answer.
Then it's going to go.
And then all (alway all black spectacles) smoke to the narrow.
Greene's lying more.
"What?" Rascona asks.
She's crazy.
"Have I seen a lot of trouble?" She asks.
"No," Greene's smoking.
"I don't just think the Whites used the word n-u."
"That's right," the second black displayer confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use more version."
The subject of the proposal must be unexpected, but the room is powerful for a guy.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not only for the proposal, but they want to respect the memory of their killing.
It's starting from the beginning.
Now, Rascona's words are strong.
Nobody's hungry.
Renewing ends quickly and violently.
Challenge, challenge, and silence.
In addition, a woman in the sepulchre stays near the body and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice will be painted by every other word.
Over 10 meters, the fifty spectacles requested the eye of slow and skins.
In general, the half of the white and half of the whites are nearly equal.
In June, there's a couple who has come to look at the present of the State of Ithaca New York, but the largest part is local.
They went to the office of Brooks on the branch of the victims in Georgia's pressure.
The murders have changed the story, and there's a story in the event location.
After a song, Greene calls to the victory to check your body.
Children are able to look at the teacher and unmoving body and to smooth each other.
"They are not really dead," the little son remembers as to remember themselves.
For several minutes, Greene thanks to the general.
The spectaculars presented the spectaculars are broken down their references and requested skins.
Bradshaw's loved Marbaugh, the local Klux Klan's leader of a man.
Nick Rascona's getting two displayers and then clean up after the race's presentation.
"Don't worry," in the presentation, there was a woman to be comforted.
"We know that you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the public and the spectaculars are gathered together in the common evening.
From Altada, the White Party's Debates will be strictly presented in the presentation of just to meet the black park.
Denise Duplins is hard to find words when he describes the raising understanding of the present.
"It's hard to hear the words of the camel, and looking on the deceits that speak and do people who seem like you, just because they look like you," he said.
"My presentation has made a point to note that the scores are going to happen again," he added. "These are only called to be held."
On the other hand of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civil rights in the same table.
He's already telling her first year's proposal.
"Renewing is a powerful experience because it makes our experiences serious, but it is also a teaching experience," says Brooks.
"Then message is that this can happen again if we don't take it.
Those who don't know their story are judged to turn it back."
Reduction in the trades is dead: to remove the "impossible parts" of this phrase
Is it allowed to discharge the magazines of the cocktail before it's been punished?
And how much do you take away from the analytical rate of the big deal, that presses even how much?
The answers are strongly divided by opinions: one is an address of the most recent message, others do not want to pay the parts of the wrath that are not used and who are home to the rock.
It's not known in the business.
For example, Helsing's Froholah's K-City Market's wheat markets are found by a lot of robbers, for example, a lot of fuel reviews.
The magazines are carried out to the biology.
According to the public news of the Economic Economic, the neighborhood in the winestic is married to trade.
But how many extents of hatred is to be removed before cutting it really makes money?
What is the meaning of the wedding room?
We've tested how much the price changes when the price changes from the analytical, the latvia articles, the shirts, the arcades, the arcades and the scarlets takes the magazines or the cups out.
Cooling: 2.10 euros as a price of the currency price was 1,80 euros, when all the reviews were removed.
Ananas: 2,30 euros total payment price increased to 1,95 euros when the rate was removed.
The Latvia Article: $2,60 was $2,40 when a short way would be removed.
Amounts: two centimeters totally paid 75 cents.
Without price, 60 cents.
Parshaal: Central parshale paid 1 euro and without a rate of 80 cents.
Result: If the magazine and the officers are gone up to the ship, set one of the best ten points in one way of wrath.
In percentage reported, the price of wrath is even 20%.
That is why, in this case, $1,20 EUR should be set in total!

Garcia took his right hand and asked, "How are you going, master?
Good luck!"
I'm going to be able to cut off Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel seven days.
When two cameras came to photographers, Egis Climas observed that the training between men would be "complete in the relationship with the sizes."
"I'm a former heavy officer," Garcia remembered.
"I've moved a series over [63,5 kilos] for Broner, but I'm not so big.
I'm a little 63.5 kilometer.
I want to go back to the board.
He needs to rise up [61,2 kilos] and then we can take it.
That's what we're looking for.

The rules on the sales of various agricultural products and location products are understood in the first year.
The reviews are based on the new financial market Directive which will be applied from the first year.
Currently, the shared assessment of employees who sold employees and agricultural products is based on its own regulation.
No partial requirements specified in the law.
Financial (FA) itself recommends that in the service of location works its own APV1 or APV2 investigation.
The Financial Agency is the APV-insurance in order to organise the APV-insurance research to the Oy-insurance company who sits in the research group so far as the Financial Surveillance (Fiva), the university as experts of the field operators.
Studies are extended to 12-15 students, and their tests launched Aalto EE or the development services offering Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
The web pages are reported that, generally, both tests are "in particularly large relationship with the requirements".
Research learning materials include 10-15 books and numerous other teachings and technology.

The most important bank personnel offers all location services have been produced by APV1 or APV2 investigation, since their manufacturer is exploitable in accordance with the proper rules of enterprises.
Then there are smaller bank officers without the names that the person affects the manufacture of the card investigations, says the Savik.
According to him, such banking pills are "modifying."
The APV1 investigation has completed 13,000-14,000 persons since 2000, and more required for APV2 projects, approximately 3 000 persons.
Some bank carriers look at the priority of the investigation.
Moreover, there are aware of the serious party requirements.

At least the ten of the trading is a average of about 8 100 euros.
The ten men of most training are more than 9 000 euros in a month or more, most of women's tenth routes of 6 400 euros or more.
Only a active company can provide the provisional provision for the location service.
At the same time, the workers and tasks are trusted in self-regulation.
Fiva, according to the review, has been in contrast with individual cases in which the exploitation and performance of the agricultural managers were not sufficiently based on the action of the Council.
In addition, as a seller of marketing products, it may work in the principle, although professional and capacity were in a heptic level.
Finally, your situation has been free and free.
Moreover, there are aware of the serious party requirements, the Saviko's fact.
According to the Satellite, a new financial market Directive (MIFID II) from the beginning of the first year.
It requires that each company responds to that the person offering services is sufficiently part.
Financial monitoring shall be eligible for what to share.
Financial market surveillance Marko Hovi states that one of the clear changes in the present is a provision for the participation and experience of the sales of branches and agricultural products.
According to the Holiday, new requirements, and the own persons of the officers, and those who sold products for any company.
The Hovi states that the proposal of the Government by the Ministry of the Government shall be granted to the provisions of participation and experience.
What they look at is the end of these visions during the future disease.
The company also needs to continue to be concerned about the needed education and the need for monitoring and complementary education.
All of this shall be documented, and the company is of this viewing responsibility that it also has been done.
The house indicates that the company should, for example, carry out the actions of the person in a single unit.
This will certainly be a different requirements depending on whether it is a procurement or selling products.
According to the Hovie, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experience if participation or experience is not sufficient.
So if the company pays a new employer who does not exactly implement the specific criteria, the employer must work for a certain time with a fulfilling person.
According to Hove, the amendments will be distracted and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products shall be undertaken in the beginning of 2018.

The definition of the biological life in this way is very untrusted.
If we are sure not able to determine an ear, we should not do that we can't," he said to the Metro-sanomale.
However, the Agency of Justice Medical Information, GRANSON, described the test integrity of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the risk to prevent the child's growth is small.
The risk is the biggest situation where the risk is to test soon 18 years, then the risk is at least 10%."

Neymar has made a fifty-year agreement, so the transfers may be writed by 44,4 million euros for the year for the next five years.
The first sanctions of the Reil's economy rules were made in 2014. The most saints were digged to PSG and Abu Dhab to Manchester City.
PSG has received 60 million euro billion, which was reduced to 20 million euros later, and the results were determined to restrict the 21 players to the shipping group of the Messiarch at the ship of 2014-2015, instead of 25 players.
The EUFA monitors the securities that can try to transform its economic rules through the growth of the results of the companies relating to owners.
For example, if the Catalyst company supports PSG, but the value of support is considered to be a larger level of markets, the EUFA does not make sure that it is particularly supported.
Thus, when the EUFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Travel Authority was limited to PSG.
It has also appeared that a part of Neymar's PSG-responsibility could finance Qatar in 2022 of the MM-contingent operation.
However, the PSG and the Organization Action denied that Neymaris should be carried out of the MM competition. The EUFA would be very easy to demonstrate such organization.
The PSG's previous sanctions, the EUFA, usually, follows the rules of rules.
For the situation, the sources were reported in the torches that the EUFA has not been consulted with the PSG transmission of Neymar.
The sources gave the Associated Press Report Office for the proposal that their personality should not be cleared because they have no authority to discuss the PSG situation.

PSG waits for the sale of new sponsors in Neymar’s day, and increases the sale of follow-up products and plots.

Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger also relates to the State to finance the action of the football manager. Arsenal's owner of the American urgency.

The maintenance of the economic rules of the Reil will be very difficult, and there are so many interests that relate to the comprehensive player to represent the State."
Now it's hard: MM-masters in Helsing
The long-term chief Arttu Pajulah and the three-millian officers of Christians are in the fields of Sure Ghazara in Helsing, although he should prepare a MM-shell in London.
Christian Muslim may be competited without the advice of his leader.
Tomorrow, the pawl is concurred in the ship of the length and on the evening of three miles in the ship.
Due Leader, the Armenian Ghazarian has not received wisdom to Isoon-Britannia.
Ghazari has tried to take care of the Great Business of British.
The manager has the call for MM Officers, but it has not been able to obtain wisdom.
Is this the first of Brexit's cases, or what, Mr. Jorma Kemppani said?
He's always treated wisdoms before, but now there's a problem.
He's doing everything to leave.
Ghazaryan has been worked on the Suomen Urheiluit SUL for years.
It's not so important.
When someone looks at the station's stepmarks, Arthur Pajulatti said about the possibility of disappearing.
MM-military Federal London requires a miracle
The MM concurrents in London begin in the day of the day and end the week after the end of the week, on 13 August.
The aircraft, the landscape and the gas is the ships that the proper penki urgents share independently related to the second year, the success or not.
The effort in the heart of the penkiurheals is measured in the medals.
There's other mediators.
Besides, the beauty of young urheilers have remained increasing values of others, in which the experience is able to ensure that the growth MMs are fully possible.
Now, in the small Sweden, there are no young manners in the MM, not really concerts.
The MM-Mital Suom needs a miracle.
Gratefully, the interest and the surprise of the weakness is that wonders can also be disappeared.
It brings penkkiurgels to the front of the TV and moves to follow the skins, although London’s metals are also cut off from the time at the evening.
From the previous MM-Key 2015, Suomi has received one promissial.
It's got the Development of the Tero Children.
The scarlets are waiting for the More Metal now, although others tell the results of the last time of his and other explorers, and the remaining of the Short in the last middle of the values.
In these cups, the longer man remains a big defense in the story.
For other challenges, the final competition or the proper prevention is sufficiently good execution.
Speaking and faith in the future years of the Summit’s supervisory mechanism gives good success in the international values of young people.
The achievement of young gifts and the financial support of its work is more important than to achieve the smaller expenditure of representatives.
The progress is not at the moment but requires a active work for years of urgent work and patience as prepared as a penki urgent.
Furthermore, they are part of the value of international urgents and enjoy their existing equipment.
Speakingly, the kids in London stay in the history of Usin Bolt and Mo Farah, not for terrorism fear or loved beasts.

Small pier nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer ja Comrade Detective
Historically, as well as the 80-year-old loyalty days and the 90-year-year-old breach (in the days of David Wain and Michael Showalter, the State-Squeater of the MTV), made their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars were moved to the greatest things in the area.
The cultural product is also the parody and the description of the permanent reminder we have been in the Facebook time.
The town product is feeling almost alive.
First Day of Camp works well surprised, not only because of their drugs (or otherwise, H. Jon Benjamin’s voice was reported as an enemy Background).
In the middle of the middle-year-old spectaculars show the full-acceptability of the neighborhood teams, which highlights the possibility of the passion.
The Years Later, in which adults show adults, is less sensitive, and its parody is better: for example, the 90-year-year-old stalkers, such as the strange picture of your hand that develops.
In one subparagraph, one of the famous apple Powerbooks, inline-relevants and "Remove the chair from 1991."
Many of the story are the same as before.
Good-bye Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer, but there is no longer over Kacie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a girlfriend.
And in a worm, Ronald Reagan (no like Michael Showalter) is a criminal pump of George H. W. Bush (which shows Michael Ian Black).
As always in such sorts, the best sides are.
A special amusement is to see the bicycle Paul Rudd, who has a bottom under the board, or Matt Dillon "soul patch" film Singles. Ruddy showing Andy, the king of the lady, begins to be an old mother.
Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. At the last time, friends are going to go to Wet Hot American Summer on the first night.
The Amazon Comrade Detective's series retracts the second natalgia: The Americans' s hot war spirit, the Atomic Blonde film and even the GLOW-shirt box, where the south of the south.
The Comedia Sergeant has created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has led to Rhys Thomas. It has been romantically made as a policedriam of 1980-year-year-old, where the bucaristic officer fights the truth, the atheism and the market-leinism.
In the majority of the Greece and the idealist Josefina, they see Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulici. Their mountains have dubed the English Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levites.
It's a wonderful idea,
But it's not a lot of others.
In Sarja there are some good visual branches (polis are carried out time by looking at the TV shock as the Americans look at the football).
There's a group of relevant votes, others, Jenny Slate, Nick Obfferman, Mahersha Ali and Chloé Sevigny. They're like a funny game.
However, the Comrade Detective remains too close to the social drama’s follow-up – for example, the killer will be able to be locked behind Reagan's name. So the series often begins to feel poor from propagand.
The six long ranges are too long, and the drugs of the seed are not enough quick and large.
In order to fulfill a series could be better than agitprop-satire, although Gregor and Josef are combined in the majority of the United States and in the school there are always two fleshly men in the hampurians.
The communication to the communist general is that the long-term culture can make all of the products and skins.
Sarja’s imaginary romantic creators were not wrong: we were able to disobey our neighborhood and their history.
Couple Toni Tauru rises on Monday in Macedonia - in the previous UFC students
Toni Tauru wants to get a reach.
Toni Tauru gets a lot against Macau because the Brazilian Leandro Issa has been achieved last year in the UFC organization.
Brazilians also have a black steel and the world's children.
I'm going to get myself against my parents.
It's a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru says.
The Couvola had to rise in India last weekend.
The process was based on logistics problems, but three campaigns were achieved in the Chinese self-management area of Macau.
Tauru hasn't seen others before.
This was the first time I was cut off.
It's a lot of time, because the preparation and the train was getting a lot of time.
However, the officer is happy that the campaign has a new time for the campaign.
The week's expectation doesn't just affect the preparation.
The move doesn't affect the bottom, because it's not a week.
It's more worried if it's a lot now.
The Tauru is in a number of previous campaigns who are responsible for the forces to establish.
This time your situation is another.
Issaa's a cowboy describes a typical Brazilian.
He's a lot of aggressive officer.
I'm sure he's coming in the first one of the hard ones and try to bring it to the ship.
He's winning the world's best, so he's part of the priests.
The preceding challenge was not based on plans.
The Philippines Kevin Belingo struck Taurua badly, and the winter left to Philippines.
I've never been taking so much to be able, and he has never got any part.
When I went to escape, he got my eyes.
It's really hard for a long time.
New motivation
A part of the liberal officers takes one time in the year, the part is up to the bottom.
For example, Issa’s future rebellion had received last time in September.
There were three chairs in the last year.
Now there's a second campaign for the last year.
It's been a smoke in the field.
I've trained the last year, and I've been good all the time.
Yet, I've just been able to take care of it.
When the 32-year-old was heard of the future, he decided to change the country a minute.
I was in Space, and I got a joy back.
We've got a very good treene when one of the Swedish guys was with me.
It was a great help, because on the midnight, a cowboy would be raised into a physical campaign.
I've got training against the same contradictors, and I've got a range of strippers.
It's a 32-year-year-old finality.
We've got to shoot seriously.
If there's an opportunity, I'm going to get it off.
They can't be able to be clear because they use most of them.
Macao's first in China, the Tauru.
It's the hearing of China Las Vegas.
I believe there's big and great night before.
The Central Bank of England is 0.25%
The British Central Bank is expected to indicate that it must be predicted when the economic growth has been unexpected and the inflation inflation has finished specialities from corruption.
The British Central Bank has warned that the economic growth continues to cut down, and the bank is transmitted to corruption, because the achievement of the family is increasing more pressures.
The decision-makers responsible for the financial policy of the Central Bank have decided that the sound of 6 to 2 should be 0.25 per cent, and the Corporation has received a less effort in this month since the economic growth has been unnecessary.
In the fourth year of inflation in the bank in 2017, its growth increases 1,7% and 2018 to 1,6%, and it also warned that the output of households would be more pressures because the inflation is expected to continue to reach the three percent of the rate.
However, the core costs are required for nearly years to reduce Brexit’s inflation, and the bank also stated that the costs may be reduced by more expected in the financial market.
Furthermore, the members of the official have decided to depart from a massive economic package which was made to be implemented for years ago in the rest of Brexit's regulation.
Bank stops the Term Funding Scheme program in February 2018, although it is expected to be now expected to be provided by the programme to provide an equivalent finance to the banks $15 million more than 115 million.
The Bank's High Decision Book provides the following: "In accordance with the proposal of the Rural Political Affairs, the sustainable development of brutal products continues at the next year when the calculation of the real results of households reduces the consumption."
In respect of the valuable banks, the inflation needs the "financial policy" expectations of the market "a lot more".
The markets are prophesied at this moment of the first exhaustion of 2018 at the third quarter and the second year in 2020.
However, the bank has highlighted that the possibility of restrictions are "assetable" and "increasing."
In May, the bank predicted the growth of 1,9% for this year and the growth of 1,7% for the first year.
Now it had its growth in 2018 in 1,8%.
The point was cut down to the dollar and the new sequence of the euro.
The point of view of dollars was 0.5 per cent and was $1.31, and it was $0.4 per cent and was $1.11.
The decision must be preached after the expected growth has increased highlighted expectations of corns. The BCT increased 0,3% in the second fourth and 0,2% in the first fourth.
Bank waits for 0,3 per cent of growth at the third of the fourth, but a little bit of a year's end.
The inflation inflation was only a little hope for inflating inflation and low rewards to houses that are suffering, and the bank says that the room is still roomed before it changes better.
The bank added that the money policy "not can't be able to calculate" results for nearly years. However, it expects that payment development will be "excellently" at the end of the third year.
The building will also strengthen the strengthening growth of the application of the British products in the follow-up of the woods, which will cause a part of the impact of the privacy consumption.
The decision made a year after the higher estimated 0,25 % of the arrangement of the EU review results, which eat the tree calculation.
The Bank assessed that the total changes of the decision may actually begin in the price and in the economy for four years.
Before the introduction of the Centre Bank’s decision, the corners were still needed to be more voice when the inflation raised up the pressure in the households. Three decisions required to be 0.5 per cent corners in July.
Inflation helly in the last month 2,6% in June 2,9%, however, it was expected and the inflation was raised again in the next month.
The bank says that the override of the objective of the two per cent was made of a "country" smoking.
"In view of the last account of Swap-country, the competition in the homeland market would seem an excessive extent when the trusters will take customers and want to stop the year strongly," says Coreco Mortgage Brokers leader Andrew Montlake.
"Marks seem to be particularly good to those whose current legislation agreement is concluded, and new agreements are further recommended, their corners are low, and there are also unchanged options."
NHS Amounts for 10 000 HIV medicines
In the beginning of September, patients may be calculated by the HIV medicine. In the highest right, the decision has been made to be financed by the medicine in the public health system (NHS).
The NHS stated that the substitution of the pre-profit expenditure (PREP) was determined to be at least 10 000 persons during the first three-year trial test.
NHS was recommended to finance the test after the administrative law had to be able to the most highest jurisdiction of the last year, and the NHS could be paid to PrEP medicine, although it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
The manager of the NHS of England, Simon Stevens, invited to be a tortured decision on the "new intervention" and the national AIDS organization described it as an important moment.
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, the first starts to take an advertising experience that extends other clinics in October. The experience is to get their full extent in England to April 2018.
The substitution of the preliminary staff (PrEP) must be taken to the HIV medicine that reduces the tariff.
The experiments have shown that PrEP is significantly reducing HIV-conditions in risk groups.
Before the medicine is to be taken, it means that there is sufficient medicines that provide HIV treatment.
The medicine can take a day or two hours before sex.
The behavior group includes homogenees, biexual men and transsects, as well as people with my HIV-positive partner who do not get effective treatment.
The Clints choose the experience proposals are fulfilled by men, women and transfusions, as well as those who do not know that the HIV-positive partner does not get their disease of antiretroviral treatment.
In England, people who are reported to the treatment of the general medicine can also take the experience in the local sexy training.
The programme paid 10 million pounds, and the NHS of England signed this week after the International Proposal Agreement.
The purpose of the test is to be evaluated by the potential of the PrEP medicine to achieve a wide clinical display of its pointing, to take and treatment.
"This significant new intervention should be fulfilled and implemented already existing multiple and still more active ways to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"There is one of the significant accommodation of over 30 years in fighting the greatest health policy of humanity."
"This is important to resolve in HIV's responsibility to the fighting of the HIV," says the manager of the National AIDS Organization Deborah Gold.
"If the PrEP medicine is directly involved in the necessary and risk groups, it may be a transforming effect to the Inglaterra’s HIV epidemia.
From the beginning of September, the NHS' risk group will receive a medicine that they can decide itself without need to discuss with the partner, which will be strengthened to improve most people's life.
This was welcome to the news."
"It's important to ensure that the experience is quickly started in the whole country, and nobody who is in the risk group remains outside it," says Terrence Higgns, leader of Ian Green.
"The PrEP medicine that is used in the experiment is processed, and we can soon protect the human beings of the HIV.
"The initiative of the PREP trial has been welcomed to the event that has been late in several months for the exploitation of the government," says Mr Sharon Hodgson.
"We have shown that the medicine may have an increasing effect on our work that we are doing to prevent HIV and to stop the extent of this disease.
The experience helps us to understand the real benefits of PrEP medicine.
Now it is important that the experience is attempt as soon as possible in the whole country, so we can handle HIVs and go back to the nearest situation where HIV's expansion has been able to stop."
Life quality: traveling and fishing solutions have been made from a small house of Earl's Court
Joanne Leigh was invited to remontate the ex-based banker Joanne Leigh changed the Knightsbridge residence in Earl's Court in 2014.
The matter is King Anna's Time's style house in the first statement. Remont's success reports that Joanne has not yet gone to the camps and has changed.
"This before I lived with my ex-shirt in Knightsbridge, very carefully in a larger place," Joanne says.
"I didn't have a hundred of hundred prices in my price.
I went here in a room, and I noticed that the rooms were higher than my room in a silly place.
I've made a gift on the same day."
After that, at least 90 square apartment has been tested for a complete form.
It was two in the room where Joanne wanted to be more conservated, and the room height, so that the room height might be used.
"I wanted openness, great windows and many lights.
They were my request." He says.
He paid the work of Erfan Azad Notting Hill from the Duck & Shed Planning Office. Erfan received a job to use about four meters of high rooms and to create a location that would not only be remontated and sold home.
The height of the room was not sufficiently reached to the two surface situation, so the challenge was to build a trailer in which he could stand.
It requires Erfanil to create a thought.
"The treasures are so multiple.
The states were to be organized so that it was not necessary for the crisis.
The buildings should be modified so that the height is just appropriate and on them and below."
Erfan could place the situation at the top of two pieces of rooms on the detailed details.
Retrouvia's comaristic window is opened in a style style.
Short rooms, silver effects and Serge Mouile vintage bills are a recognised style.
The use of the teatrality, the situation of feeling and light.
The covers in the bottoms of the slow front can be able to affect really lower.
The shadow that is in the middle of the bottom is like a window opening the view in the other room.
In the clouds of the internal steel, Joann’s aeroplanes are maintained.
Stillness adds that the box will be hidden when it is not used.
No new solutions provided in the Taitto board,
But in the box of Joann, the doors are raised up in the same way as the cart door.
"It requires a little planning," Erfan reports an exhaustive MDF.
"It's balanced, or it's increasingly easy to locate."
After Joanne's continuous status and maintenance plans, he received 16 additional quarters, the second room, and the best solution.
"When you sell, it will be resolved, or the value of the scientist," Erfan says.
"In the basis of the interviewer goes into the room and calculates the price based on the border area."
In Joann's apartment, the wall area was added by use of low materials that support publicity.
"The resident is in the fields of the habitation, and the tunnelside house is born partly on their basis," Erfan says.
"Nobody's interested in the streets to the electronic directions.
They're important, but not the same way."
Joann's apartment is an example of that good planning and additional projects can be based on exclusive greater.
Then it can also be so that it doesn't want to change anymore from the apartment.

So he taught the famous ones to eat the shoes, the shoes once.
He said it.
I left the lake to the moon.
I was still more, finally every day.
In the middle of 1997, Mr. Panja opened the Law's business in his room.
There were two small tables, customer sites likely below 20.
He taught us outside to eat the tail, also to sit in the winter.
When you have hungry and locations, you can't leave a white room between yourself and your visit.
We've seen better, and we've been friends.
Finally, I was sitting with a wordbook in learning from Thailand.
Two years ago, he went to the market manager, but then the room had to change, because you did the grounds of the grounds were too amazing in the government.

He has seen how the changes of life of the customers are changed and the foods are changed.
He remembers what the named man came to eat with my first kids.
He remembers me as a lake and a lie, and remembers what I was young.
It's nice to go to the lunch less later than others, sitting on my own place to the road door, and change the counsel with Panjas.
It's not the important thing we get from her.
He has taught the sustainability and the internationalness of the cyclical cyclicals.
He's opening our skins in addition to our thoughts and our heart.
Today, many of them are talking to him, thanks for the growing protection.
I'm gonna get Panjaa.
Although she has been hard, she's always a friend.
She's a happy.
He's going to be in the front and black.

We've got the customers for a cycle.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day for work.

Brothers are fighting over 500 million dollars
Two brothers asks Victorian’s largest investment periodic, which is more than 500 million dollars, which is involved in their Italian generation for 40 years ago to base the family company.
The first president of Carlton's feet officer and advisor Colin De Lutis lives in the Tooraki range only three younger brothers in the house of Paul. The younger brother has brought the highest right between the brothers' employment and transport activities.
Paul wanted to leave the family company from 2014, but from one of them we're going to get a catker.
Brothers and their mother Anna own 38 investment, which is more than half billion dollars. The family began to get a property when they took the trade from Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans City, which was 160 moves.
I was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
The money was used for interests, and the family has now owned officers, businesses in Brunswick and Sorrents and households in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and towns.
According to the Agreement of the previous family, Colin has at least two thirds and Paul's attorney of the third company. Paul pictures his father "for powerful and central."
According to the right documents, the property equipment means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul approximately $176 million.
Paul's not satisfied with interests and money.
"I think Colin left the best interests to himself in the proposal," Paul wrote in the first stated witness in the court in 2015.
In the last period, it was considered the first time at the highest jurisdiction after several contracting businesses.
The brothers also rejoice about who is governing the existing movement, Paul says that Colin has closed him from the trade operation.
According to Colin, he doesn't like his place, but he's damned by Paul's room of a few officers.
Colin writes together his first famous witnesses that he wants to make a solution in the matter.
"Italian's traditions, the family is important to me," Colin says.
Through the homicide, it is always growing. Favourite suggestions, emails and reports are hundreds of pages. It is explaining Deloittes, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer's counsel companies, as well as the world's best and the best experts, such as Allan Myers.
And Anna De Luctis and his former husband Luigi were Italian movements based on mathbarians and heroes at the end of the 1950s. In the beginning of 1970, they took the trade from Brunswick.
They were used by a safe family from Collingwood's office, which Colin founded the first ground of the family.
Colin says that the trade is based on "the last years of luxury when Paul was still a child (because 10 years)."
Anna De Lucis says that he and Luigi died in 2012 wanted to move interests to the sons agreedly.
"Luigi often said that he wouldn't want to end up the right of his brothers."
Two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer matched in the De Lutis Concern Affairs. Colin says, Mark got 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars for leaveing the company.
Paul says that Luke and Mark are "the economic proposals of his department."
Colin had had to be a profiil, although the old Australian football member and television member of the Government of the Legislator, Eddie McGuir's best friend in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lut and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered, and he told his textbooks that it was not right to comment the matter because it was in justice.
"It's very crazy that my brother Paul has decided to take me into justice and bring our family in the name of our family," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the right that he had tried to agree his brother’s requirements.
"Now our father wouldn't want us to discuss this way," Colin continued and told his hope still to get to the solution.
On the day of the day, the hope was shown in the summon.
"We're going to be resolved in the jurisdiction of the nearby," Colin wrote.
Trumpin's new personal officer will be limited to the use of the president's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's going to be successful.
First.
The Poltico report says that the white house's new personal officer will limit the President Trumpe's media use and news followers, so that the boss would not be so often difficult.
Agent Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the white house's new personal officer John F. Kelly meetings with his first work day, he took the central problem that he wants to resolve: he wants to restrict the President Donald Trumpe's information.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all the information, as they were printed as well as in the information states, should pass through it because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly says that it is serious, but others have tried to restrict the Trumpin media and failed.
The President Trump has a relationship with the television of the 19th century, and, as President, he still looks at a lot of TV.
"If the President Trump had been disturbed of an unexpected news, he would have seen that later information interactions had been discussed as far as far as far as," the President Trump worked in the Consecutive campaign Sam Nunberg in February, said to the Politic Report.
The Political Reporter Tara Palmeri wrote that "the six-year campaign worker, according to the Trumpin Twitter's use, is essential that his personal media authority belongs to the basic smoke of the challenges."
Okay.
But it is to be crazy to say that Trumpin Twitter's use would never have been in control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don’t know others — maybe the Trumpin twitters would have been still worse without their design.
Of course, we never have to know what messages from Trumpier remained without sending.
If his personality even sometimes has been able to stop the problems that he has not caused, their work was not bad.
However, no one has been able to stop Trumpia's throat.
The problem is part of that in the White house there are competitive groups that try to take place by giving Trump information that supports their views, and the information may be confident – or then not.
In May, the Politic wrote that the advisory advice would give the President the question information.
The operator Shane Goldmacher told me about a statement:
"The current and ancient workers say that he can be increasingly courageous of the magazines in which he is considered, especially if they are telling about a few years of information, and then he must have to know what information is about.
So, at the end of February, when someone directly gave the President a copy of the network-provider Charles C. Johnson on the GotNews.com website, where it was caused by Katie Walsh a few of the white houses.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter because of a attack, and before he had raised false crimes and founded them later, and he did not also present concrete evidence.
On the other hand, Trump had started the thing to be held from Walsh's personality."
Goldmacher added that the Reince Priebus and the White House Director Rob Porter were trying to use the document management system for Trump.
And what happened?
Kelly trys the same three months later.
Perhaps he is shown as more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive himself and his assistant continue to think about his own matters.
These unchanged facts make Kelly a very difficult task.

The Circuits returned over the "millions of ships"
The most occupied economies of the West Midlands are renewed with self-profit citizens who were able to overcome the highest and to return to the field of houses.
The Circuits stopped a couple of hundred miles of chairs at the nearest road in Solihull.
They were sent out of the region in May, but they had been able to overcome the greatest traveling, and they took with them the children, the horses, and the army of the chariots.
The Circuits had been able to overcome the traveling point that was left to be protected for the fat.
The assaulted inhabitants have caused Solihull to “the perfect independence of the problem.”
A permanent resident tells the Kittholians to come in the monthly evening of Bentley Heath, where they were cut off the woods.
"How hard it is to act because it seems to be completely hard to resolve the problem.
The Circuits were here in May, then they went away, but they returned again.
They came to be more and probably more tonight."
The resident said that after Birmingham, the problem was resolved by refusing his head to the ports.
"Asun Streetsbrook's Road, and there's a weird payment to be a dominant, until you can't do anything for it."
According to the rest of the town that remains, the Circuits returned soon after they were leaving them away.
"They are more precious, and they even have raised the horse to put into the porch."
According to Solihull's officer, it is aware of an unrighteous exploitation of the Streetsbrook Road. "We've been able to break up with the police of Solihull as soon as soon as possible.
It is extremely important for the detection of evidence that the most locally possible is to make a police report on a discharge or criminal action.
It helps to create a full image of the situation for the legal command."
The ransomed people ran into Portuguese travel
In Portuguese, people who have been full of people in the front of the campaign have been considered in the court today.
The following sequence of the pack was dead yesterday two people.
Two men flying the car can get a cause of death.
It may have 16 years of prison in Portuguese.
The small aircraft of men had been done yesterday because of the packaging of Lissabon at the front of Sao Joao da Caparican.
In France, there were hundreds of people who were a part of a drinking machine to escape the water.
When the machine was considered a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The computer first got a man who was on the computer.
One hour after that, the driver rose up and when it was raised up again, she got a child's head, she told Philipe Janeira Jonal de Noticias on the border.
The kid's killed was on the ground with her elders.
The girl's parents haven't been hungry.
In Ranna, the oils were cut down a little machine soon after the whistle.
The girl's father and the other people went to the machine and began to cut it down, reported about the case of Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called a flyer as a criminal, he was unexpected.
It's amazing that no more people died.
There were two men in the computer, they didn't beat in the box.
His feet traagically lost the criminal MM wind again: "I would not be a world-master."
Matti Grand-Hamari celebrated early midnight at Sweden's time MM-or banked in slows in Canadian Big White.
Grand-Hamari wins the first time, too, cross-MM-cult.
Everything, the MM has already been told for three.
It's time of unbelieving MM kids!
Twice it was treated with gold, time in a good kitchen, the high-Hamari's phone has enjoyed.
30-year-year-old costs gave thanks to his owner and very successful preparation in Sweden.
According to the Great Hammar, the number of assaults in the ranges will grow all the time.
The whole paralumination is grown and really developed a lot of years ago.
Some are small, and there's a lot of new resources.
I always thought somebody's coming after the black horse.
Everyone feels like a different winter.
Grand-Hamari lost his second feet in the increasing inflation in 2009.
He had been calculated increasingly young with his friends, and he didn’t bring an accident to go to the road.
I'd like that, I'd like to think what my life would be without it.
But my office has always been saying that it's a mistake.
There are cards playing what has been done, the Grand-Hamar presses.
It would have been published by the titler of a serious problem and the loss of the ground, and it doesn't do it.
But he turned the carmeon into the front of the hardness.
Yeah, I said your situation turned to win.
I wouldn't be a three-quality world-mester without a triangle.
Before the success of the 23-year-old, the biggest aircraft of the High-Hamar had already been cut off.
During the midnight, it went to the real work after an accident.
I've been young with my friends, and we've always been killed in the X Game.
But they were a lot of robbers who had smoked sometimes after a while.
After the problem, I found myself somewhere from the start of the X Game.
I wouldn't have been part of the presence.
I was a 23-year-old, and I thought this would be a very long life if I stay here to shoot and shoot.
I've decided to take the balls out of here and start to work.
I'd say I'd have been happy.
Leo-Pekka Research was very happy for the election of the year's trigger.
The negligent oil pioneer received his reward in January in the urheilugal.
According to the Great Hammer, this wind is important for the improvement signal.
It was a really big thing, and the winning was indefinitely gained.
This will certainly open the eyes of the world to be improved.
Why is it time to start a double-fold world-mester Matti High-Hamar's campaign campaign?
Then we'll see it at the time.
I'm trying to do my best for my progress.
The High-Hamari hasn't yet held all of the hazards.
In the first year, I'm going to get a big target.
A year after the paralysis in South Korea.
Yes, we're going to get a metal out there!
The majority of the Syrian refugees does not believe to return to his home permanently without the end of the war and the father goes out of the land
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees studies were discovered in Jordan and Libanon young civilian packaging views and positions.
The Syrian refugees to break the bread in Jordan.
The majority of the civilians does not believe that the home will be permanently returned.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the father’s department of the land is the most important things that should happen to return to their homes.
The Trumpin Government does not see the change of the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller's Agency declared young civil packaging views and established in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has already been studied in the ninth year of the Arabian currency and the positions.
In this year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees studies were discovered in Jordan and Libanon young people in Siriatic Packages.
In March 2017, the investigation replied about 400 from 18 to 24 years of civilization, half of women and half men.
Meanwhile in Jordan and half in Libano.
According to the investigation, the younger over half of the civilian packaging is not believed that their home will be permanent in the future.
42 % of the responsible ones may think that their home returns and four percent did not have to say.
According to the investigation, the younger decisions of the household are affected most of the wars in Syria and the prevention of the Father in the country.
At least half (47%), the end of the war must be the most influenced of the household officer, when the fourth thinking would be the importance of the father to get out of the country.
Only below the tenth is the most important to decide as factors in the economic situation or from Bashar al-Assad’s exit of Syria.
Military actions are not solved only conflicts
The Syrian Office was asked what the author is the most important thing for the conclusion of the conflict.
In addition, it is considered that the military end is more important than Mr Bashar al-Assad's commitment.
Your four have the President of the Al-Assad for peaceful association.
The nearby half is expected that the Syrian conflict is now in the beginning is necessary and political and military solutions.
Conflict to resolve only military actions is not believed as a fourth round.
The majority of the Syrian refugees sees in the last year, when the fifth reviews its power to be strengthened.
According to the answerers, the most important war against the fathers, and generally against terrorism is that the media would interfere to people of knowledge that the father has nothing to do with Islamic.
A number of military measures and the training reform has been in the first way.
The tenth of the Reil should be considered important to create younger more rewarded workplaces.
As regards the impacts of the Trumpin management into the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of responses believe that the conflict is not changed during the Thumpin management.
Besides every four believes that the Syrian conflict is a worried Trumpe ship.
The minds are divided in two regards whether Russia and Iran participation have improved or hurt conflicts.
Monty Vinies exports half-time codes, so that the network remains in the system - its development of the databases use for example Wikipedia and Google
Espooois company MariaDB develops "the fastest growing world" open source database.
Coordinator Michael "Monty" Vinies' decision of MariaDB does not pay for users anything, and it can develop the net through any front programming.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are regular computer users, but paying clients are not required.
The data stores with computers remain in order and quickly available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image will be made from the database, and the images are linked there," explains Widenius.
Vinies, a technology director of MariaDB, exports at least half of the time codes.
A man who makes out of the beautiful hands should be concerned that the Internet works hardly.
Vinies developed the most recommended open source of the world with the Swedish David Axmark database.
In 2008, the Sun technology company took a billion of dollars in the MySQL, and after years, the Oracle's programmers would be able to cut down the Sun 7,4 billion.
When the Oracle tracking occurred, a large part of the MySQL developers reported its output.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle who didn't give sure the promise of the future of MySQL," Remembers.
He was already based on a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life work to die.
I ran out from Sunil's two hundred best developer, and I'm sure that the code continues to be safe with the same friends who have finished it.
Since MySQL is a open source database, MariaDB could develop its own handheld.
The name was just supposed to change.
The freedom of development of MariaDB was based on the law.
"In my SQL, these assurements were not done," states Viness.
Although many have heard of Vinieness and MySQL's billion town, a lot of surgeon knows nothing about MariaDB.
"The last years our growth has been about 50% in the year," says MaryDB's budgetary director Kenneth Paqval.
The middle MaryDB is not yet winning, and the Paqval is a famous company's recognition.
In that case, he explains that MariaDB was evaluated by a range of 20 million euros.
Since the database is clear, the company has developed services on the environment that the companies are ready to pay.
MariaDB also helps data changes, which may be more than a year-by-out if the client has been used to close the database.
The change of MariaDB from MySQL is successful at the moment because they are versions of each other.
On the other hand, the largest DBS bank banks in the Spanish Telephone and Caakkois Asia are the paying clients of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud service, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, provides for clients MariaDB.
In the same way, MariaDB extends new users automatically in the Linux distribution system packages where MariaDB has been replaced by MySQL.
Although we're a small company, we have contacts with the greatest games.
"Agents have the world's largest teleoperators, game companies, banks, and even a central bank."
The data markets are still controlled in the databases closed by Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
Oracle MySQL is also unrequired from the site, compared to the traditional locked database of the company.
Although the majority of data offices have been lost in the market in recent years, the games like MariaDB are still cheap, although quickly growing.
At about 50 billion dollars in the database market, open sources are not even a billion.
However, the pressure value of the code source cannot be measured only in the rail, since most users do not pay any of these programmings.
The Research company of Gartner announces that enterprises have already developed over 70% of the internal applications on open data databases in 2018.
Furthermore, over half of the old databases should be amended to open or transfer at least.
Large companies will not receive new clients because the largest part is selected by the next open source.
This has been guided that the licence payments of commercial data is rejected to the cloud.
The companies want to make a lot of money as the previous as a smaller customer," Widenius ran out.
Since the change of closed data is difficult, most of the customer businesses have been able to take price.
"There's a lot of customers that are really difficult to move because their old applications and others are closed in the database," Widenius says.
He also believes that the measure of customers is in full.
When the licence payments are up every year, the client is moved more or later to the open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous, and the service is better because the client can easily change to another database.
In many enterprises, it is not only a large system change when they move to cloud services.
In the same way, many changes the database program.
The last rate of MariaDB has received 25 million euros from the European Investment Bank of the EIB.
It was the greatest admitted growth in the north countries of the EIB.
In the world, there is about 115 employees and the purpose of paying more now.
One reason for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public implications.
The company has a public sector customers, for example, in British and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros for a year.
"More land wants to move the open source to the solutions of the open source and to use this more efficiently," says Paqval.
The vision is hard to make money in Sweden even closed to health systems when open systems are worse, and there is no space in the gratitude of one of the programme company.
Some say that the open source code is ideal, but I think it's a better way to do the code.
The community helps and makes those who do not know themselves or can do it.
55-year-old Vinies is a second protective, Linux developer, Linux Turvalds, the most recognised source of open source.
The vinies helps other enterprises to develop operating operations on the open source of the open source.
I still like 4-5 talks in different half-year-old world about this matter.
Italia is intended to relate to citizens' savings
Italy has warned citizen organizations who save in the beginning the fugitives in the Mediterranean that they can not continue their activities without prejudice to maintain new rules in respect of their action.
"If citizens are not attached to the new Action Board, it is difficult to see how they can continue their action," said Mr. Marco Miniti in the debate of the tournolic La Print.
It was a day after the Italian authorities had been back-ups in the field of the German Jugend Rettet Affairs Organization, and it was unfortunately made a cooperation with human explorers, which promoted a disagreement.
Only for years, the aid organization was denied from the commentary committee Ambrogio Cartosion’s detailed causes.
"For us to save human humans, it will be important, and we are very sorry that we can't work in the search and salvation area at this time," the organization reported in the social media published in its statement.
"We're going to assess the causes since we're focused on all the needed information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities were observed from October since Jugend Rettet Organization.
The husband, immediately, has obtained the aircraft, directly from the human shipmates who have received its use again.
One of these cases is considered only a couple of kilometers from the border of Libya. The information appears to the document of the prosecutor containing the Italian information interfaces have been published.
The husband is unfortunately a Italian border guarantee that monitors salvation in the area, and it is in the moving way to help.
According to the Agency, the Italian policy must be joined in the beginnings like Juventa.
Only three search and savings participating from the nine citizen organization has been recommended to maintain the action report: Play Children and Malta MOAS and Spanish Pro-Actitiva Open Arms,
which has reported to the torch new rules to be necessary but approved because they are not subjected to "markable changes or items" as a saving of the organization.
Without limited organization, there are doctors of Nobel's Nobel registry in the field of rejecting the Action Board.
In the context of the Council, it was noted that the number of transmissions in Italy in the past week has been calculated as long as the last week, which he should demonstrate that the actions in order to strengthen the Libia border guard and to cooperate with local citizens have started to produce the results.
"In the last days, you have started seeing light in the tunnel," said the Minister.
He explained that in the plans, the discussions with the citizens of Libya continued to continue with the projects of economic development, as well as with Chad, Niger and Male, to reduce the number of fugitives to Europe.
In the absence of his killer's avoidation on the Enontekiol, an unbelievers found out of the land - a question to the accuser
The unexpected crime occurred in the last December of the Enontechnology.
The police says that the 36-year-old man of the Czech Republic was unexpectedly killed at his 26-year-old school opening.
Previously, it's said that both were employees.
The police has also said that it would be unbelievable after his doing was gone with two dogs to the land.
A man was found out of a cold ground, and he didn't make an advertising when he was locked.
The causes must be taken within a week.
The struggle will be achieved in the Lapin's driving rights in August.
Harry Potter and all my friends who are known by Robert Hardy are dead
Breakfast Robert Hardy is dead in 91.
The spectacular's death reported to the town of this family.
In 1925, Hardy's birthday started his shower in 24-year-old teater.
When he was long, he also showed in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the Role of the Role of Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter, and of the animal medicine, based on the book James Herriot, on the television of my friends.
The recommended order of the BBC was described by all seven.
Michelle Carter was condemned by the text reports on the prison of self-sexuality.
The Massachusettian woman has been condemned two and half years of a prison textiles and telephones, with which she had been looking at his fellow boyfriend Conrad Roy's self - murder.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months in prison and five years in a conditional.
Carter was judged in June, his sonfriend Conrad Roy murdered on 13.7.2014.
"It's my family's crazy," Conrad's father said in the town's seat.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter was looking for a change to the court and waiting for the investigation in freedom.
He struck 20 years of judgment, but, according to his lawyers, Carter and Roy suffered the illness.
Carter listened to the judges in the cross' hands of the cross-shirt looking at the creation of the land.
"He killed Conrad Roy," the accuser said to the justice.
"He decided Conrad's life to improve his own.
He hasn't taken the responsibility," the accuser continued.
"He hasn't shown the destruction."
According to Carter's advisor, the case has been made "in ordering circumstances that Carter has fallen deeply."
However, the officer Lawrence Moniz was thinking that Carter's "in or in the illness and even in the mental health problems had a significant impact on his action."
Conrad's mother's Lynn Roy's explanation, in which Mom said, "I'm not going for a day, I wouldn't hurt my son's death.
I want him to be honourable of me and of how I know of all of this, and I'm trying to please his sister in this pain that we're always going to steal."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy said to the right that he's "one" thinking that he's never going to see his brother's worst and not to be done to his children.
"I'm serious to lose a man who has been in my life every day from my birth, because it's not threatened," said Camdy.
It seems to be a future prevention, because in the State of Massachusetts there is no law that, in the case of suicide, is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found out of the car to dead in 2014.
The murder was raised up to the Kingdom attention when it appeared that Carter had been in his textbooks, more than his boyfriend to murder himself.
I don't know, murders are many," Carter wrote in many messages that he sent to Roy this death for two weeks ago.
Just a little before Roy himself killed Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You have to only start the generator, and you're free and happy."
The officer Moniz said that Carter had taken attention to Roy's death, and the officer stated that Carter wouldn't be useful in the case by giving disagreements.
The murder has been divided by the opinions of experts.
It's only hard for Carter. One of the officers are Amanda Knox, 30, who was judged about the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published the Knox's opinion, "Michelle Carter needs conviction and help, no prison."
Secretary-General of Naton: You've fallen in Russia the worst of the cold war
The military relationship between Naton and Russia has been clearly challenged, commented the Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as the tourist.
Stoltenberg caused Russia and its state in Ukraine's conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship in Russia is now more difficult than it had ever been a cold war after the end of the CNN.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could try close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially after the unlawful combination of Criminal and Russian regions in Eastern Ukraine, the relationship with Nato was noticed.
The Stoltenberg says, however, Nato has still been encouraged to act so that they wouldn't cut off their grounds.
As long as we are strong and so long as we are prophesied, we can go to Russia's political mountain conversation to refuse the situation of suffering and the new hunger war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg in the United States, President Donald Trump proved that there was even a dangerous level between the United States and Russia.
Trump was encouraged to thank the bad countries for a few congresses that accepted new Russ’ responsibilities last week.
Audi changes 850 000 diesel engines for the test tests of car rental carriers
A day before Aud report BMW was offered to update more than 350 000 car programming.
The Leader of BMW said that the company believed that "the most series of options than managers." He refered to the European cities, otherwise to the BMW's hometown to Munchen, who wanted to restrict or refuse these vehicles.
Daimler reported its changes as a tissue to reduce more than three million Mercedes motors.
No companies have been talking about the review.
European carriers are the market materials to ensure the objectives relating to hydrooxides in Europe and the United States.
The type-oxides of diel motors are looking at the threat and astmation.
The installation costs of neutral equipment are up when the cars are difficult to prevent competitively.
The German car rental carriers were strictly monitored, and Angela Merkel was caused to be assaulted from the posting of large companys and the population of problems.
The companys are trying to refuse Volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen was installed in the cars that decreased the controls in the tests. In the general time, the repository was greater.
Many Volkswagen leaders have caused crimes in the United States, but the leaders are investigated both of the Atlantic.
In the last month, the leader was held in Germany from the first termodynamic responsible for Aud Motor Development Assembly.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so it can be given to the United States a possibility of jurisdiction.
In this year, Audi was carried out as a crime on Volkswagen, and the authorities concluded that Audi had established a car system that could turn the European extents, and the crime was based on the investigation in the United States.
Aud's research can significantly reduce Volkswagen's position: the part of the manufacturer of the clusters of Volkswagen's wind is greater related.
The vote of the Venezuela started to be increasingly, large views in the vote
According to the company, the number of audits reported by the Venezuela authorities is at least a million larger than the number of real votingers.
This is an increasing opinion of the company that does not have any role in the future, the President of the National Democracy Tibisay Luzena said to the leaders.
Maduro ensure that the crisis ends
In Venezuela, the representative was chosen as a planned vote, which is to change the foundations of the earth.
The opposition is strongly critical vote and has organized the change of thoughts.
Maduro’s responsible opposition has achieved their own opinions so that they should be started at the time of the nomination.
According to the report of El Pais, the national security sectors of the country began to take a local time in the middle of weekly to take their desires to the country's budget.
It is a purpose to ensure the safety of the nomination.
Airport changes smooth Provence lavental
The laventelist has become the symbol of the South-Frankreich Provence area, but now it will disappear the air change.
The laptop was reduced because of the benefits of smoke and shipping, and the researchers and agricultors tried to find a problem to resolve.
"The Laventel is directly in the Provence area because it has suffered the impact of the air change in recent years. After them, in particular, the disease rates are clearly reduced clearly," says the expert of the CRIEPAM research agent Eric Chaisse in Provence.
"This is quickly the lifetime of the lavance.
Furthermore, the smoke has brought a lot of small smokes that flow microbacterias."
The boards are the balls.
The laptop is cutting the travellers, and it is also very desired for the gas and cosmetics.
"Instead of the smallest star and large skins, we have now smaller skins that are very developed or broken or missed," says Chaisse.
"It's likely to say the parts of the front oil are less preceding."
Effective baptization is exploited by smoking the ground costs and raising growth through the shadows and the water smoking, and also developing the smoothness of the continuing steams.
The murder of the employer appears to grow growth in Mexico
The report of Riodoce-Sanomal Proposal on a week is generally convocated to discuss how the most productive cases relating to criminality, corrupted authorities and to be considered in the State of Sinaloa.
However, today we are discussed about security for a recent tragedian.
The operators have been designed to change the day-day rutins.
Two experiences are discussed about who is more safe: leave the children home or take them in accordance with the report that they have made the cronaat in 2009.
Security intervals have written three words in the room prior to the room: advocators, neutrals, cohesions.
They ask the officer's name to each group, and the evidence are not required, the records and the knowledge are sufficient.
To the table, the names of drug cities, policies, traffickers and artificials who are unreasonable in government or drugs, they are criminals who make measuring measuring news as spiritually dangerous.
It is increasing, and it is still in the parts of the officers. According to the Committee of Protectors, at least 25 manufacturers have been killed after President Enrique Peña Nieto was held in December 2012, and in the Protection of the Communities of the United States on 589 billion and injury. The picture was killed at least seven officers in the seven party.
The last victim is Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Riodoce, the manufacturer, and the source of the offer.
"The failure is to live in Mexico and to be publisher," Valdez wrote together many of the drug powers.
He is depthed, although he is over all. The Riodoce Building page covers a light image where Valdez seems a middle. Image reads: "Just". Three-minute manufacturers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have seen to the T-shops who correct the faces of Valdez. The Valdez has eyes and are formed in the form.
The Court is held under two months after the death of Valdez. The employees will discuss the common trauma, their pressure, their disasters, their disasters, and the surface of the surface.
It was established in 2010 by the Agency of Prosecutors in particular for the treatment of the cases of suppliers, but according to the Committee of Protectors, it was only due to two causes.
The murderers of the employees are only increasingly jurisdiction, as well as thousands of drug carriers and organizations relating to criminality in the years, only a serious end will be concluded to be conducted by the justice.
Riodoce providers are trying to continue to write about the violence of Sinaloa, although they are wounded and the situation is still dangerous.
Ibarra says that the security trials are just a little useful because the killers do not know nor have hope of justice.
"This meeting is directly called a time-sharing," she says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why this happens."
Valdez was removed from the office of Riodoce in the capital city in Culiacan on the morning 15.5.2017.
He was thinking in the midnight of Toyotall only a couple of cards, when two men stopped him and struck out of the car and shocked twelve balls. It is usually linked to the magazine name: Riodoce means twelve eggs.
The gun went out with Valdez's car, and rolled it on a road.
Valdez was 50.
He left his wife and two adults.
Should you shoot the movies quickly and get free in Culiacan.
However, the death of the election is a muscle silence.
Sinaloa has been a more mexic blood fighter after Guzman was held last year and was struck in the United States in January, and the groups want to fill empty.
In the roads of the synal, some or many people are dead in day, and in the grave land, drugs are a corrected two-birross graves that are greater than many households.
In the frontier party, there is a "calm" when only one card rules hundreds and drug records in the United States.
Although Valdez was very known about his work dangerous, Riodoce funder and leader, the 60-year-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty of that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes have led to the killer of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce was published by Damaso Lopez, and he leads a competitive group that fights against Guzman's sons.
This was possible to explore Guzman's sons: Jeng members of the unexpected customers received a magazine once the magazine came to selling.
Another error was that Valdesia was not cut out of the land after the same publication had been able to explore.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and outside, and his murder was being transformed in the violence of the publishers.
He had found so many of his friends and his colleagues had no more involved fear for him.
He was made long in Noroeste, when he decided to build with five colleagues with Riodoce in 2003. The parts of the magazine were sold for $50.
In the signal, "It was impossible to make journalism unreasonable to drugs," Bojorquez said.
In the meantime, the magazine was made to feel strong and famous, and its self - and reviews became growing.
The employees estimated the possibility of publishing a major class of journalists without fear of sensor, and the readers reviewed in the magazine things that nobody else has been published.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodoce won the Mary Moors Cabot Park News in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez has received the international reward of the freedom of refugees to follow the history of the Mexican drugs in the same year.
He's obviously accepted his fear.
"I want to continue my life," he said when he received the payment of the Committee on the Protection of the Officers.
The drug car is in the Sinalo "five life," Valdez said in the last October, in the Rompewinto TV discovery.
"The employee must take a dealing task against him, or show a fool.
I don't want anybody to ask me where I was, when I was killed here, why didn't I tell what was going on?"
From the Riodoce persons, Valdesia, a guaranteer who struck as a satanic, and they take a friend from which they always received advice and advice, and they will take a teacher who knows how to find it.
They believed in his rutins.
He's always used to be painted.
He went after the office in El Guayabo bar and always sitting on the same table.
Now they're going to ask if you've got the rutins for him.
The death of Kollegan has also received them to take their ways to do their best work and remain in the spirit.
"There are not worthy of that if we talk about their women and children and their pure trade activities, their secret drugs.
They were left outside the things," Bojorquez said.
In the best case, it means strong self-controllers and self-controllers,
I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm
If you feel that it's not all right, let's stay away.
The problem is the leader of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, that "the currency can stop, and so it happened in Javier's case."
Ancient rules are no longer attached to Sinhala, nor they are also in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrere and other countries with dangerous networks: ensuring secretary records, courageous authorities and corrupted authorities.
Action environment is continually changed.
The telephone was not able to import in a room where the Riodoce Security School was held. A few days ago, it appeared that only in the governments that were sold for the officers had been followed by activists and informors in Mexico.
Outside the building, two cops were cut off the tree's guard, protecting 40 steps from the helicopter.
The Government of the State was determined to warn Riodoce officers located in the middle area of Culiacan.
A couple of the manufacturers considered a half of them in the field, just if these two cops were in the 50% of the group of the State's officers had not to be trusted.
There were a few months since the informators had been used to rule drugs in a mountain country.
This week's number, Riodoce's office had three chairs.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Singapore.
The magazine also began to explain that the financial use of the Government was focused on the house of the public.
Furthermore, a group of people had been cut off in the cart on the card.
There was no official information, which was broken and how, therefore, was to be careful: all cities knew that the railway was also in the recommendation of drugs and authorities.
The employer found public documents that the railway was registered in the name of the policy of the policy (PRI) of the Institutional Republic (PRI), and the PRI has governed Mexico policy at all levels for nearly a century.
The officers of this are still accused of corruption in cases of publicity.
Villarreal asked the writer to write the previous cases in the same place. In one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son had been able to escape and refuse the army's solution.
A few months ago, the readers would have known that they had received their trusted information on the ransom of Valdez column.
"First, we'd already know what happened," says Villarreal, 46-year-old, who has received a bodily body creation for the "El Flaco", Oak.
"Now all the connections of our data sources are kids."
The Valdez workroom has been changed to a garage in which the contractors are maintained responsibilities and targets. The workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have been able to achieve the freedom of refugee.
The operator Miriam Ramirez took a couple of kidneys on the next morning to the representative of the local accuser Office for the reason that the new officer had been killed again.
Salvador Adame died in the airport of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the deadly, it was found a burned body based on the DNA tests of the authorities.
The operators have started to protest more soundly in the whole country. In the addresses of the views and buildings, the text "SOS Press" appears.
Today, Leader Bojorquez is in Washington, where he's trying to support international support for the investigation of Valdez case.
The afternoon of the killer of Valdez, Ramirez met the officer of Sinaloa and caused the officers to kill and kill them because they tell the truth.
He has also requested him to move him from the matters of the government, because he is worried that he could not be able to be objective.
Valdez, in other cases, stated that in Mexico officers were organized by criminality, criminality had obtained authorities and unintermediate society.
Lastly, in the book of Narkojournalism Valdez, the drugs will kill informors, but they will also be killed by the commands of policy and security officers in the Countries of Countries.
According to Article 19 of the Control Group, more than half of the officers in the last year were the time of police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are silent by killing," says Ramirez.
The murder has an influence for the murder.
No one forgets the blogger Mary Elizabeth Mazias' death in the north Tamaulipas border of six years ago.
His body was a message signed by Zetas card, "I'm for my writing."
He's locked around his head in his computer's keyboards and hearings.
A part of the report has decided to stop its operation, such as El North sanomale in the north state of Chihuahua, a letter of Miroslava Breach after the married killer of Breach.
Continue its action, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez would publish the report to the drug cart: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the manufacturers have been departed from the States or from the whole country.
The decision is hard.
It's hard to find a job in the land, and the whole time is to be in custody.
Sometimes criminals looked for his hand, as obviously came a photographer to Ruben Espinos, who was killed with four women in Mexico City at three months after he was departed from Veracruz.
To those who continue to work, each day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — whose time he had to come to the rubber – admits that the writer of drugs would be afraid.
"I'm coming a manufacturer because Mexico is in the way of hell," she said.
Sometimes, Riodoce's manufacturers sat down in the middle-night before the operation, in the case of the new number was ready. At the time their phone started a color mark.
During the battle of Mazathlana, 19 people were dead in the struggle between Cilpai and Security Guides.
The war was worried, such as in the area, in the card message.
The employees launched the news of Riodoce websites on a smart phone.
The future should be set as new on the next day.
The Syrians went out of the neighbour — again a new shot.
Bojorquez would offer warranty police:
If they were scared, they'd have kept it very well.
Riodoce's office continued to be based on this massive form, which a man seems the average of the whole Sinal.
Bojorquez says that it is not even possible to stop the work. "How can I make the magazine when our manager asks to go to the way to do something yet on the same day when Javier was killed?"
Hannu Mannese's olympian project started with a strong back-- "More place"
In April 39, Hannah Mann's feasts left shortly because the employer began to prepare.
However, the day of the expansion started katastrophically when Manny was sick in the floor.
It started a long disease system, which ran nearly five weeks in half.
On May, he went to the whole hospital.
First, it was flunching and finally such children's kindness as a steel that was able to eat an antibiotic corner.
I could only make the planned provisions only ten percent.
I don't remember when I was last so long.
It was a lot of place when I couldn't have been useful, Mannny told the Ilta-Sanom.
Testrilos Rome City
In 2007, the World Master has been designed in the second week in June, which seemed on 12 June, the research center of the Kilpa and the Urheil of the KIHU's insurance tests.
In the test, the smooth smooth smooths moves in a math which will increase at least three minutes.
After each three-minute, the match is stopped at about ten seconds, and the tester takes from the skin of the skin of the steel.
I've seen the last sick at 32 minutes, but now I've stopped 28 minutes.
It's coming against it, Mannny tells it.
Best direction
After the beginning rights, Manny tells his holiday health.
I have done multiplely peaceful aircrafts that I have been trying to normalize materials.
Now, it's really good for five weeks later.
It was also half weeks of a aircraft.
I'm supposed to go with my family, too.
In the last street, Manny participated only in the four world's competition before the MM-coctics.
The best outcome seen in the open concurrence when Mannine rose up at the 18th board.
Directions of the waters
The officers of a man and a landscape Petter Kukona have made a plan for the exploitation and competition plan until February.
Now we're going to take a different training compared to the last train.
After the first kids, the prayer would have three weekends of the world's cupcake.
In July, the purpose should be joined at least one of the weekends of the world, perhaps in Ramsbourg.
At the end of February, the plans should be joined to Seefeld.
I hope that after that, the name is found in the list of the bottoms, Mannny says.
The Pieongchangn Olympians would have been the Manish's six financial leaders.
Now it is important to stay healthy, Salt Lake City in 2002, gold in the assembly campaign.
Dinosure was protected by enemy
In the beginning, it seems to be scared.
Now the researchers have discovered the first research results on the finding of a canadian exploitation of the total value of the carbon, which was so maintained that experts call it to Mona Lisa's dynamism.
It was preserved so well that the investigators could even determine that its criminal egg was punarism and it was a "good progress."
According to Current Biology, it is the best maintained dynamism and the best representatives of the world's law.
Still the fossil found is nodosaurus, which is either 110-112 million years ago.
The researchers have this very surprising conservation of fossil really significant finding.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the most recently maintained fossil has been maintained.
It was found in Canada in the North Albert of Suncor Milenium 21.3.2011, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
He was part of someone who didn't feel a natural part of the environment and decided to investigate the foundation.
The fossil from Calli was sent to Tyrrelli's king paleontological museum.
There was a penetrate in six years from 1100 kilometers of the steel.
The results of a lot of work are now visible.
"If you slip your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says the scientist writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher in Tyrelli's king museum.
"It remains a science of Mona Lisana's dynamisms, one of the most beautiful and maintained dynamisms.
In Nah studies, the flesh eating dinosures were probably significant to this growth, although it was a pansarier and it remembered the passenger.
The red white pancert was able to be able to protect it, and he also protected it from the bottom and bottom, which still exists in many animals.
According to the experts, it could be so much better to decline its environment and to refuse the enemies, greater dynamisms.
110 million years old nodoaurus rise up in the titles in May, and it is now shown in the king Palaonology Museum of Tyrrelli.
The researchers have named Borealofel's museum technology Mark Mitchell, and Mitchell has been a team from about 7 000 hours of dinosure.
Nodosaurus has been preserved so amazing that Mitchell and international investigators have been able to determine the crimes and the pintures of the banks and the shapes.
They felt that you protected it in the world of animals, still a general color in which the skin has gone out of the wind and bottom.
It was also surprised because the Borealopel has awarely greater than the present animals that have to respond to the coloration.
It may decide that the flesh eats the dinosures make it acknowledged that evolution recommends to be hidden in place of war.
Current animals, for example, in pearl, cepro and army, have the same coloration, and they are very smaller and so easier to indicate that the nodosauross was seriously infected.
"Sure, strongly the dinosure of the pansharoid dinosure says how dangerous the dinosures of the covenant were," says Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic associations of the Nodosaur's crimes shows that it was punarism.
The computers continue to investigate the nodose in order to make conclusions of its life, and to examine the contents of the ground to find out what it eats in the last material.
Researchers believe that it was dead when he died, and he thought about the sea where it was up to the sea.
Albert was in that time the same darkness as today in Florida, and the ships and the sea were probably lower than today.
"This nodoaurus is really significant because it has been maintained, and it has also been maintained in the original form," Brown's reality.
"Therefore it looks nearly like a old covenant
It doesn't require a lot of thoughts: if he swallows a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
My contract was the time of the teropodes, the powerful two-shirts, the dinosure of the flesh.
Although their king, Tyransaurus king, or millions of years ago Borealopelt, their mighty foreheads have been able to raise this ransomed dinosaur.
Tyransaurus was included for example Acrocanthosaurus, about 11,5 meters of a long-six-six-six.
The news found in the Current Biology News of Nodosaur is published, and they believe that Borealopel was crying after the sea's death and murmured.
It was found in Canada in the North Albert of Suncor Milenium 21.3.2011, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
According to the Museo, it is the best maintained dinosure of the world from the death of the steel and panzerine to the lonely.
The bottoms were middle of five meters long and even 1300 kilograms.
Their bottles cut out two half-meters.
Researchers believe that this planted growth traveled through the west Canadian, until somebody came to the opener.
It has kept a small detail in the sea seat later.
The rest of its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that it's still remaining in the pansharing hard disks.
Michael Greshko also wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "except a lot of lots than the struggle.
Whatever it looks, it feels more impressive.
It's still fossilized in the 6-year-shirt disks.
It's the right front of it, five guards upstairs.
I can also calculate the offences of the feet."
How did a active student learn to answer the question: Who are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply arranged 9.8.2014.
She came a day before to New York home from St. Louis and sat his airbnb at bed to visit Facebook on the phone.
Then he noticed the message in the cluster:
"The police killed just 18 years old, and his body is still on the road."
He had a wonder that nobody else had given the same information to his input, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
At his time, there were numerous reviews from user @TheePharoah.
My user's name is a drivinger in St. Louis, who twice in the reality of Michael Brown's death. The white police was shooting a 18-year-old black brown Brown Ferguson in the Missour State.
This user also put a picture from Brown's food on the road where it was left for four identifications.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't a new thing to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later on the same evening, there was told Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of the police locking and calling people and the father of the Brown's father who reads in the cycle: "Ferguson's police just killed my unwashing son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video photo, where the police stood before the thoughts of the dog.
He's telling her to see a video where another police burned his hair and said, "I'll get you all... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers his reality.
"It wasn't the murder we've already been told and that we could say likely.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was hate and weeping."
He set up the room home for the next day.
Firrell went to search for his father's six-year-old daughter and decided that they went to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson after the next three years, has been made a documental film "Whose Streets?". It received its first films on 11.8.2017.
The movie is a story of the achievement and the thoughts, the love and loss, and the strength and the sinkness of the local people who have gone to require answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson's room, and with her with her with his daughter, they went again to talk about, "It's live in the black and where it is." They were talking about things unreaded before that morning.
"Remember, when I told you how the Muslims have come to fight for those things who believe?" Ferrell remembers what they said to the daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old son, and it's not right."
"I couldn't have taken a daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"The events of this day are... the events of the passion.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow in it.
He needs to be prepared for activity and organization, but he also needs to recognize different words and circumstances of the experience of a Black Life, and he needs to know what we should do to liberate ourselves.
Although I could be happy to protect him from the racist, he is even like other girls.
I feel that I'd be disappointed to him if I'd protect him from the reality."
Their first stop location in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, which is located in the police field, and it became a active field when they waited for information about the processing of the case and finally knew that the police would not be able to cause the crime.
From here Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local expert who made the shipping packages.
They bowed the woods into the puss and divided them to the minders.
Ferrell started to relax with activity in a new way.
"Activity has been completely changed on April 9th," she said, "When I learned at the University of Missouri in St. Louis Ferrell, he was President of the Office of Medical Trainers, and then he focused on food rights and healthy community in black community.
"I didn't have a experiment about ordering.
I mean, it just happened."
After weeks, Ferrell met in the night address of Sabaah Folayan, a manufacturer of files.
Folayan said that he and the pictures of Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were "switched to tell" what was happening.
She said, "Do you really want to tell what is happening, or do you want a story you can use for good?"
In the background of the understanding, they were the unreaded times when the local community was opened, generally whites who would only want to benefit from its difficulties and sinkness.
"We've heard that in Ferguson's born and growns there's no common voice," Folayan said, "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted the manager of assistant Damon Davis, who is recognized to activate the prisons of death.
With Davis, Ferrelli went to the project together with six other locals, and the description group followed the events to shoot Brown in the next years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we're talking," said Davis.
"I was important to me how local people were presented in the film because I was present in the same way."
The objective was not focused on Ferrelli's experiences, as it was wanted to seek that in the national office, "not this is a carismatic leader, but a Community." Ferrell showed the most openly.
That is why, in the files, we see the surprising half of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage.
"I've seen a time to be low," Ferrell plots to tell him how he felt to see a movie first time.
"But I understood that this job and the inimimimic figures of blacks are going to prevent certain obstacles."
Furthermore, Ferrelli's story again and bring the middle of the black cheer-shooter role in the Black Lives Matter.
Track was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shooted the black teinipons of Trayvon Martin in 2012. The three based officers were two cheer identities.
"The leadership of the Murder's Queer has had been all moved up," Ferrell says. "It's leading us to fight constantly with a lot of grieves.
"Musters of Queer's have been able to lose everything."
The floor is the same: "The smoking is really surprising women who have a lot of cheer-wives."
However, he highlights that Ferrelli has not been chosen to the document for his cheer identification.
"He got an energy move," says Folayan.
"But it's not bad that he was in the front line, but the cheer women will live in a lot of things, and they have a lot of games.
His energy is white."
The new descriptions groups have been left to Ferguson for a long time, but the community and the police are still letters.
Ferrell has two and half years remaining, and he has received a judge of supporting motors.
His opinion of the social policy of his household is short and low: "Shearted."
Although he still trusts in the school that he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"There is to fight our freedom.
We have to win our obligations.
We have to love and support each other.
We can just lose our hair."
Accommodation: creation of graphics from Chelsea Manning's DNA
In New York, Fridman gallery, the views of the visibility are increasingly raised in the middle of white, black and blue faces, which may be fully considered by the uniformity.
These 30 dozens are the teams of Heather Dewey-Hagborg's formats based on Chelsea Manning's bottom and brassed DNA images.
Manning sent visions from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he held 35 years of court. Manning was sentenced secretly on the transfer of diplomatic electronic electronics to WikiLeaks page.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance was opened on 2.8.2017.
In the background there are two years of letters between Dewey-Hagborg and Maning. Dewey-Hagborg connects its work on the work of technologies, computer technology, and warranty. Manning is transnational and ariseing other students whose prisoner Barack Obama is on the third day of his office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzes Maning's DNA algorithmally and carried out 30 images based on its neighborhoods. They are amazing, although a little theoretical ability to change DNA data, multinaturality and future relationships and identify.
Chelsea Manning, who was born by Bradley Edward, has openly told his wifes that were already murdered. She was tested for 20 crimes, others for criminal crime, computer and warranty.
In prison, Maning's judgment was only one picture: a rock, black, white self, where the maning in the car is sitting on the place of the traveler. He's got a plastic base base, from which he came to his identification.
In the Dewey-Hagborg, the draft Stranger Visions project that he completed in 2012.
There he made forms of crimes information, and he received DNA information, for example, of tupantumps and rubbers, and made pictures of how people could have seen.
Then the tattoo has received e-mail from the Paper Magazine book.
"It's what they've got to do with Chelsea Manning and needed their picture," Dewey-Hagborg reported a new show.
Maning couldn't get him in prison, so the magazine took contact Chelsea and asked him if he was interesting to make a Maning DNA image.
From the Tahitian and his prisoner, they were surprised of letters, and they wrote to others for a few years.
They even did the Suppressed Images' series book, which pictured Shoili Kanungo. The future was described in the presidency of Chelsea's judgment, and he could see the show.
In reality, Obama shorted Maning's judgment just a few days after the publication of the series, which was happy in the national military office after seven years.
It is also efficient that the show is opened right now when Donald Trump comes to his own war against data-agents and trans-country soldiers and continues to focus on Twitter to strengthen the powerful two persons that he had to do so.
Dewey-Hagborg believes "It's his purpose."
At the gallery road, there's a big name in Maning's name, where the name of the family is in the heart. The tattoo requires the end of the "automatic steel, which has been based on a family, round, sexuality and culture".
In the responsible road, Maning's DNA jacks: a long C, G and A libraries written in a short-screen pressure.
This 200 fonts – or nucleotide, such as the science definition of the tattoo use – connecting Dewey-Hagborg wants to be considered how we all are, at least from our biologist.
"I hope to help people understand that we are the same and many data are very personal and open to the future," says Dewey-Hagborg. In the presentation, there is also his Spirus Memory video in 2007.
"DDN's telling unreadless story, there's 30 presents."
The last work of the show is in its own room: the Maning and Dewey-Hagborg series.
It's Maning's honey, who's going to get out of prison like King Cong, with my hands of Megafon.
"If they get you quiet, they won," reads the picture.
"Don't worry."
"Test is a letter I got from Maningil," Philadelphia's household's officer says.
"I'm so impressed that I'm still getting cold colors."
Otherwise in the series of pictures, Manning hasn't yet seen a display. When Manning comes to the place, healed him on his own mathematics based on their faces as a group of thoughts in the middle of displays.
It is meaningful, as all others in this show: for example, Maning's DNA age is written by a smooth height, which is the same as its delay (157,5 cm).
"The bottles were before, but I wanted to bring them into a man's feeling," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to picture Chelsea's birth of a crowd, who was also after his freedom."

The British organization is cut off for legal love innovation: maternity health care "not has a view"
The British organization is not aware of the benefits of the manufactured mother-packaging.
In addition, BBC and Guardian says that the Lullaby Trust organization who fights in hand schools refuses to use its own representatives in the United Kingdom in the mom Packages.
The distribution of maternity packages to all women who are weird is started this month in Scotland.
In England, the packing is also in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trustin, there is no point to show that the maternity package would reduce the risk of the manufacturer.
The manufacturer means an unexpliminated ground of steel.
Lullaby Trust works as an expert in the British Health Authority in a safe dream.
We don't let our official proposals go to them, because it would make it understand that we recommend this product, the organization has reported.
There is one of the lowest of the world of children's integrity, only two thousand deaths to be born.
Lullaby Trust says that the good reading of the Sumama is following many different reasons, such as the number of small acts.
It may be one author that is given to every family's box.
However, it can't be sure that Lullaby Trust leader said Francine Bates.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketing in products that reduce children's integrity and manufacturers.
Mother's packaging is a proper packaging, and it is given to all mothers for 80 years.
The package contains different needs, such as children's clothes.
This year has 53 products.
Actually, the pack is a bad box that the child can be able to sleep.
According to the Government of Scotland, all of its shared costs are fulfilled by security standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there's no security standard for the wicked officers.
According to Lullaby Trustin, the packaging may be the best opportunity to sleep time if there is no development or grounds available.
The organization recommends to use the package only for the day and to stop the use of it at the step when the child can turn.
The organization also recommends to keep the animals away from the packaging and to care that it does not be crucified or bearing.
The road was cutting from the Japanese animals.
The Japanese animal persons were looking for grain competition.
It has overwhelmed the person’s speed and has already been able to repeat in two weeks.
In the Cilpicon, you were cutting in the Stock at the airport of Shibukawan's animal tissue at the Japanese airport.
Security cameras explained that the road was departed from the animal field through the commission.
It will not die immediately because it eats food around the animal, but we are very worried about us, Joshimi Yamane, who works in the animals.
The 35-year-year-old chariot is a 55-kilone, and nearly a meter.
Yamane describes the skin as silent and nice.
In the office, the room will be freely walking in the area.
The animals haven't received eye viewers of the competition.
The front shooter was cut down in another week.
Yamane found the road on the road of 150 meters of the animals.
I've noticed it on the way to the animal.
I stopped my car and I asked my college to help, Yamane told me.
It can go faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company to refuse Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in the network startup business, but the questions did not work.
The answers were often increasing, useful, or even increasing.
Although he ensure that the issues are named, a part of the employees has been inevitably related to them.
"The issues were not simplely leading or objectives," Errett said, "the company of Madison Reed is focused on the network, and the trial has 75 employers.
Errett decided to save the outside help.
The markets have yet become more new personal startup businesses that help other enterprises to find how their workers can.
They have developed and licensed programmers that may measure the employees' interference; the companys can ask and interpret them to certain groups and groups, and to provide the employee's notification services, and in some cases, to the government of the above.
"Oma health can follow the applications such as Stravan and Fitbit, but where is Fitbits from the company?" asked the Glynt-startup founder and manager Jim Barnett. Glint provides for the company an analysis programmer to inform the workers of the workers.
Errett has used glint's program for three years, and he tells her to get more deeply view of his workers' thoughts and ideas.
The program can make quick questions and sounds for certain teams. It can also carry out the card that sees in one eye, where parts of workers are more happy and whose leaders have received most severe assessments. In these contexts, Errett has been able to improve problems.
The companies have understood that they must follow the employees, so that they may not come to the next Ubera. In the environment of the industrie has died since the previous employees have written about the culture in the blog, where the employees are attaching and talking to the problems.
Such legislation for the startups like Glynth are an increasing opportunity for transport operations.
The administration, regulation and requirements are a worldwide employment, which can be able to raise over 118,7 billion dollars to 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver Colorado, is a startup that helps enterprises to consider and promote an unexpected use.
Conversion has about about 600 clients, such as Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It did the agreement also closed with Uber.
In the way of Glynth, Convercent gives enterprises the possibility to make a question, to review the answers confidently in the reality and to carry out the problems areas.
Furthermore, the workers may notify that the use of unexpected texts may notify.
And if the leader has a cause of unbelievable causes, the choices will go directly to the government of the company.
"The general opinion has been broken by the authorities," says the Convercent founder and director Patrick Quinlan.
He remembers that if the company involves an employee or operates unreasonablely, the follow-ups can be stealed, although the authorities do not miss the matter.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 25,000 employers in 500 offices. The company has used Convercent over year because it wants to ensure that the employees are informed of the principles and procedures and get easily connected to the main contractor.
Previously, it was that if the employer wanted to report the problem, he should first explain the phone number or e-mail address that he could make the office of the office, and then he should make a official choice and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a terrible and unexpectable experience," says Ruby Tuesday's lawyer James Vitrano. With him the choices of the workers were hard to follow.
Previously, the problems remained hidden in the other city or party of the leaders who worked in the country, and now the problems such as serious, affliction and unrighteous rewards may be considered and be treated faster.
"There is the reality of the employer's reality of the entire powerful and the most lowest treatment," says Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management of Ruby Tuesday.
"We also protect our participants from your legal acts related to workers."
According to Quinlan, the companies began to relax with ethics, values and employees as far as after the account investigation company of Arthur Anders was able to follow an unexpected action in relation to the Enron scanne.
In response to the social media, enterprises understood that they could no longer decline from their public statement.
"The hope was used as a strategic before the technology came to the ethnic control," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provide the programming service that is used regularly.
It is an approval model and possibility for captain directors, and it is with Glint that Convercent has a support for main directors.
In February, Convercent sold $10 million from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital's business. It was totally 47 million dollars.
In November, Glynt has received 10 million euros from Besseer Venture Partners and has built a total payment of $60 million.
The locations are not surprised when they are taken into account the connections between enterprises, industry and risk headquarters.
According to several researchers, employees are waiting for more workplaces.
Finally, there are good gifts in the market, such as the competition, and the interesting projects are very beginning.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and evaluated and that they will give their time to their useful business.
"The employers are more stronger to the success of the company, if they're able to explore in the company and feel that they're listed and that their work is to be payable," says Nina McQueen, leader of the LinkedIn company, responsible for the workers.
The officers will get the product when the companys will succeed, and the companys will succeed when the employees are cut off.
Third part of the analysis tools are promised to strengthen the employees' rate, so it is not a miracle that they interest in the officers.
According to the experts of the employee culture, the information is important for the interference of employees,
But it is useful if it does not take into account measures.
If the company requests the employee to return, it may be a sign of change.
And if the change is not sufficiently quickly or nothing is changed, the threat can reduce the employees' rate.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, it must be ready to go to four thousand discussions," says Cotter International Chief Russell Raath, who has seen too much confidence in the enterprises to get information only.
"If the company does not take place in measures, the employees begin to think if they were listed
And if they're thinking about anything.
If the company doesn't care for them, why should they be interested in the business?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently made of personal requests for months and can take a problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
When Errett had returned to the decision-making and the quality of the report from his employee, he could change the team and arrange the reporting studies to resolve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands the employee better and hopes that the deep understanding helps it to improve the permanence of person in a long-term operation that is recognised of the great change of workers.
"If the company doesn't make the culture of the perspective, it loses the workers," says Vitrano.
"If it loses the employees, it also loses customers.
And without clients there's no business."

The teachers required more liquid in the consultations of the survey
Development could not be latter than export industry, for example, but the difference should be caught, said the President of the OAJ of Olli Luke Town.
The periodic exploitation of the public sector is highlighting the difference, it is noted.
We don't have the possibility to make agreements in which it doesn't have any way to take place of lomamarks.
As a result, the contracts are born after the documents of the private sector are signed and clearly highlighted.
The personal states that, for example, the OAJ work proposals have been agreed in January.
Percentage objectives The Property hasn't yet exposed.
It is also the President of the President of the President of the Council of the Public Board.
Short: Lomararal trade additional additives
According to OAJ, statistics and proposals are shown increasingly increased by the public sector’s payments, while the majority of the privacy sector in the same time.
It is considered that the periodic logarithmic deficit is increasingly increasingly.
The term must be determined how many of the teacher one can be
The OAJ also notes that the uniformity of the basis learning must ensure that various differences of the best and lowly achieved are grown all the time.
According to the organization, learning results will be broken, and the differences of teachers as well as the regions are continually growing.
The day of Bruins players I was at the time NCAA reduced the updates of two units
The time is soon on the evening. If UCLA's American football players have remained to talk to the camp with the new range of the camp.
The part of them is ridiculous, and their lips are cut off the cup of the officer after the first day of the advice.
The time for many of them this conversation on several minutes is the middle day.
The students in the surrounding currency will return after three hours of exploitation, to read the ends. The next morning, they will gather half to the seventh foot board of waterman.
"The following three days will come to these guys," the manager of Bruins, Jim Mora, says a little before the month changed.
The U.S. Office has reduced the number of days of currencies, and the purpose of the change was to reduce the employment of the players, but it has observed their days – at least during the periods of time when the last ends are observed.
Thus, the first three of the UCLA officers started at more than seven nights. The players had already been hard to find a space.
The restriction of the restrictions in one day means that the date of exploitation is more preceding. The ship has started a week ago before the last year, and this is the first time Moran's six through Westwood's Government, when the exploitations are maintained with the same time.
The provisions shall be 18 times before August 20, when the preparation starts to be prepared for the railway aid: the UCLA point in September of the Texas A&M.
Mora says its support of NCAA's non-regulation, although it made the time of the players even more severe.
"We really have a lot of three or four days, and it's very crazy," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to do a job, they're good friends.
I believe your situation will be easy when we go to the Sunday, and then we have more time.
The UCLA closes the posts from the foreign room. It is not easy to take into account directly a view to the spectacular range of the field and to Luskin Center, a boarding hotel, which has already been carried out behind the aircraft on the aircraft on the aircraft.
Bruins players are to change the hotel at the weekend, but Mora admits that problems can be born during a long time when rooms are available for external.
"We have security orders," Mora says.
"It's good for people to keep the room and to draw it out of the video, and it's not an assessment.
The photographs of videos are paying a lot of time.
But we've got guards there, and we've got a wallet.
We're doing our best.
I'm not gonna worry about my decision for too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom of Rwanda
In the Middle African Ruanda, the President's challenges are organized as a period, where the winter is already clear.
Paul Kagame tried officially to trial, but in the use he has affected the ruling of the land since 1994.
In that time, the RPF captain group stopped the national killer of the exploited organisms.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagamea has been estimated in other areas of opposition on the opposition of the violation and the word's freedom.
It is also accused of the fault of poverty stats.
Thirdly, Kagame will go to the ship, because the front of the President's two train limits have been changed.
In Ruanda, Kagame, however, has also been maintained by the leader.
At his time, in Ruanda, social reforms have been made and international locations have been explored in the land.
In addition, Kagama has been a large role in the community of the people’s share of the country.
The progress of Ruanda has received many Africans to ask whether the liberal multiple democracy is right for African countries.
However, Kagamek has been promised to be more freedom to the people after the land was raised on the feet.
Now you could be a good moment to start.
Facebook fights false people by efficienting the check of the facts
The Facebook is going to send possible lights to most of the independent factors and to present results under the original article. The largest social network of the world has reported it as a torture.
The company would publish a proposal on the web pages, as it begins to use updated machinery in the identification of light-lights. Possible lights will be sent to the checkers and results will be published under the original article.

He added that Facebook continued to test articles related to Ahih and makes other changes to his newspapers to reduce lights.
Birthed of the graphical book: one link history
Small Scotney's line in Kent's cross-building is now recognized by Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hidden place in 1970 and 1980.
However, there is 700 years later a story story, and now this room in Bewl's room is a subject to the series of photographs written by Jamie Rhodes, an old document writer of the moppies.
"I think it's great to investigate more than 300 years ago the dead person's text," Rhodes says awarely.
"I know a personal connection when I need a letter in my hand."
Rhodez book, A Castle in England, reports about the middle of the families in Scotney to the edward time. Each story has imagined different chairs, promised British series: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes's archives. In 2014, he appeared to Dead Men's Teeth and other Stories, whose announcement sources were British National Library. The project was a feeling.
"I was moved to the cycle when I was noticed in the letter of the cupcakes, and I wrote the letter to the combined employees with the two-year-old agents of the 1700-year-old," Rhodes said.
"It was his signer!
And the letters are cutting out of the room, because the claim was used from the tissue.
Three hundreds of years later, the leader will feel that he's on his place.
I love architects!"
In the old documents, a writer had been able to live in the lens for about four months in the support of the National Trust legislation and the United Kingdom of England, which felt too good to be true.
He carried out days from the victorian "new" linen, architectures, arts and harmfulness, such as in the fields broken tissues and hundreds of years in the campaign.
He raised an older rooms and situations and discussed forest guards, trees, and sometimes also a book with the artists who imagine.
I'd like he'd "sound fish and started write."
The nearest story of Scotney is nearly unknown because the line has moved to the National Trust Office to the last danger, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived to the place of ten years later, the lawsman was at least beginning the traveling of the archive. Rhodes describes that the archive had been held for hundreds of years in the same method: in the past of all override areas.
In the archives, there were journal books, letters of the English Empire, and cards of who has owned anything. "It would imagine that agricultures are fair," Rhodes says. "But here, the families have even been packed from one trip.
I'm going to think it wouldn't be anymore."
One of the books of the story goes to the English history, such as The Labourer. It says about a man, who is associated immediately after the preparation of the link, in 1381.
"Knightly families of Kent and Sussex are mentioned that it was about 1380," Rhodes said.
"In England's household school started in the same area, and it came to think that the chair could begin with a lot of strength.
Maybe these events are connected to each other?"
Other books relate to the story of the book — such as The Priest, the story of the priest, which Darrelli’s family hidden seven years during the religious cleansing of England.
The Smuggler again tells the secretary of Arthur Darrelli's story of the 1700th century. It is said that he was lavageing his own graves with the wooden stones (se was observed for years later when his grave was opened).
Darrellits are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family men seemed to be a lot of shepherds, and they continued to steal and get things with which they had not been able to do.
The men of Darrelli's family would resolve their neighborhood when they were married with the old women, and I see them as cool guys who participated in the parent."
Now Rhodes takes new write tests.
He took two weeks in Sweden in writing a series of books of Life, from the work of the 1900-year-old improvement, which remains just remarked.
In Scotney's lens, there's a special place in his heart.
"It's crazy to get out of here," she says.
"I wouldn't want to go back to this evil ark."
You've missed the worst war in Russia.
The military relationship between Naton and Russia has been clearly challenged, commented the Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as the tourist.
Stoltenberg caused Russia and its state in Ukraine's conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship in Russia is now more difficult than it had ever been a cold war after the end of the CNN.
After the end of the cold war, we hoped that we could try close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially after the unlawful combination of Criminal and Russian regions in Eastern Ukraine, the relationship with Nato was noticed.
The Stoltenberg says, however, Nato has still been encouraged to act so that they wouldn't cut off their grounds.
As long as we are strong and so long as we are prophesied, we can go to Russia's political mountain conversation to refuse the situation of suffering and the new hunger war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg in the United States, President Donald Trump proved that there was even a dangerous level between the United States and Russia.
Trump was encouraged to thank the bad countries for a few congresses that accepted new Russ’ responsibilities last week.

But Klitshko didn't find motivation in the office.
I used for a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembleyn college, Klitshko reported to his report.
I've arrived as an attorney and professional businessman all I've got, and now I'm going to start after my second urgent urgent.
I could never imagine that I would have so long and unbelieving progress.
I'm very grateful for that.
See the Clitshkon based on a video.
Clitshkon manager Bernd Bönt reported that the final decision was difficult to Klitshko.
However, he has always remarked that he wants to stop if he has no longer enough motivation.
That's why it's a right decision, Bente.
Klitshko has been discussed from 2009 with the United States Explorer Hayden Panettier.
In Paris, there is a child, the daughter of Queen in 2014.
Klitshkon's grandfather Vitali is also the old world's master of the racist.

It's been hungry and wind, and it's bringing it out of the cold.
There's no order to use the energy in the room.
He's getting his guarantee from 455 to the MM-shirts.
There's 445 outside.
The situation is not the same for all in London.
We need to be a bitch and wait for a better wind.
The objective must be exceeded in a period of 460.
Why don't you have any other trees outside?
It's not necessary.
Last month, I was from the beginning in Italy and Germany.
I've got a hippie in the gas and the technology seriously.
I'd probably have to do the same thing now.
Normally, the government has been able to reach the government, now the government has been closed.
What kind of nice kitchen?
25 steps of darkness.
It's a little wind when it's a weight.
Experimented ex-officer tily politicians General: "We have nothing equal now and many years."
With regard to the admitted airports of the ECU, the Government of Juha Sipil must remain in effect and preserve the budget of the State at the frontier, warning the budget for ten years prepared by Erkki Virtanen in the Ministry of State.
He says that there's no equipment.
In 2015, there was a major deficit from Virta in the Centre of Middle Wednesday.
The construction of the first year's budget is just at the beginning.
In the last time, the proposals of the policy proposals on the railway, the railway railway and the electricity support of Virtan needs to be involving.
They are closer to telling that the challenges are beginning to be near, since ten percent of the state budgets are financed in addition, we have no equality now and many years.
I think I'm even talking about the likeness when you're taking it, Virtann said to the general.
The Virtan remarked that all the wedding is to be free of the kids.
The Bureau has a long experience for the preparation of state budget assessment: he started in 1978 in the Ministry of the Government and worked afterwards as the Government of the Budget and the Government of the Budget.
Last before the staff was left, he worked as the Officer of the Ministry of Working and Life.
The Virtan observed that the three percentage of the economic growth now pronounced is likely to be stated.
All the prophecy assessed that this is a cup from which we are already gone to the subsequent year, and Suomea waits for a percentage of the growth of ten years.

Smoking on the road: Auto was coming on the motor

With the relationship with the range III, Tommi reported a long white car.
Without the driving car, it would have come to Tom.
I've been running and turned the car on the same time, and it's gone out of the hand, Tommy tells me.
The family's car was smoothed with a lot of smokes.
The parents and the back-ups haven't had two small children.
The second child is less than 3 years old, the second under the year.
Obviously, it was a good time when nothing happened to us.
No manager even thought about us, although in the place there was a weak movement.
The problem happened at the same time at 17.20.
According to Tom, nobody stopped to them, and the family called a dealer.
They got their own power out of the car.

The car went to the divorce.
Tommy tells him and a small room in the opening room, and they got a family from helping the car for a few years ago.
Without the other car information, the family will not be able to ensure the money.
That is why the family hopes for the eye viewers of the car that the family was driving in a challenge.
We need a car every day.
It's a joint to bring the kids to the story and go to work without it, Tommy says.
Tommy saw that the car was white, old car.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or from the beginning of the 2000s.
He thinks that the auto registration number was the start of SIG.
If the fault doesn't get out of it, I don't know how we're achieved economically, we're going to calculate every way today.
Tommy hopes that the events of the event or something of what they know are connected to the police.
The East-New Police and the Middle New Safety Agency are confirmed that they have had a job to be in the field of trouble on the night.
Title and items corrected at 21.15: Other than the beginning of the matter was told, the other car was not in accordance with Tom.

The Swedish Olympian officer took a year of carmeousness from the motocross infection - the cooler was broken
It's the same unrestless nature weight as Janne Lahtela.
In the comparacy, the world turned up hundreds of days in a couple of years and drew his dream in the olympical dream.
Haave was fulfilled in 2002, but the movement was continued.
He was only a manager of disasters, including a new parent experiencer.
There is no many forms of movement on the earth that the chemicals were not at least experienced.
It's invited to explore.
Always there's something new, Lachtla says.
Finally, one challenge was to stop the entire room.
In 2014, Lahtela became unfortunateness of the motocross.
The follower of his skin and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I've been cut off my house in the year, Lachtala says.
It was a good luck in the front of the conference.
He also admits that he could have been a part of him.
With a dream of time, it's a dream.
But I took that border.
It's just so hard that this nearly nearly shit is not too amazing!
After a problem, Lachtala was in a special situation.
His worst life has stopped as his dream.
Afterward, he was a long roller in Japan's freestyle board officer.
The lady started in the steel immediately after its own urgent end in 2006.
First time after I was a 15-year-old, I tried to be in my place.
I didn't just do anything, Lachtla says.
At the end of the preparation, Lachtela was often cut down in his protection ratio and physical investment.
Surprise, yes, the stop was a good experience.
I was physically and spiritually so humbled that your own thoughts did not feel serious.
They don't even have a boyfriend.
He did good to be in the place.
I really liked it because I really had to have just been.
Popular ship is intended to be the Leader of the Lawrence.
Unless he's stopped, he's afraid he'd be back to the end.
It's easier to find places that have gone a kid than a shooter!
Unfortunately, I wouldn't have seen that I needed a lot of rest.
He started as a leader of the Freestyle officer for a few years ago.
In the same time, he found a more safe insurance in the situation of the travellers.
I changed the motocross frisbeegolfine!
It's just out of the kids once.
I had seven hours in the celebration day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-increasing treenager, he doesn't need to be the same as he.
I'm not going to shoot everybody in the same form.
We have the opportunity to be their own and killers to become the best of the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots will come and we have to be worried
It is here: the report on the development of the technologies in the sex robot – just when it was beginning to feel that in 2017 it could not be changed as an adultery.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big thing now.
The responsible robotic legislation (Foundation for Responsible Robotics, FRR) would have published silently on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
"We have to be considered seriously related to the supervision of sex-robots," says the lawyer's officer and robotics and operating emergency professor Noel Sharkey Sheffield's university.
The clients can choose the color of the robot eye, the type of form, and the type of rubber.
"Arserobote's smoking, but they're seen so much, and we'll come to see them more," Sharkey said in the public report.
The sexys have developed a dreamable dreaming robots who have the darkest seed of silikoni and the active creative figures that remember the use of humans.
The user can also adjust the roboton’s own thoughts of the eye of the eye to the type and the color of the eye.
The more concerned is that the robots have a "personality" who will show Stepford women to show their progressive freedoms.
The sexys are developed as robots that have my sick-shirt.
For example, the realBotix robots can be adjusted to the user's thinking, although it is low.
True Companion - Company Roxxxy Gold-robots has been proposed personality: Frigid Farrah affects the story, Wild Wendy is a conviction and still.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is the best possible to the user's personality," the company is mentioned on the websites of the company.
Otherwise, the robot has the same thing as the user.
There are also different opinions:
It may even be broken, talking or "the winds."
In the translation of the sexy robots, there are many concerned points. They replace human relations, but even more dangerous is to be raised by women and regular race fascinations when the user is approaching as a low and responsible robot.
True Companion provides Roxxxy robots on web pages to vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator, why should men be sexy?
However, sexual robots are not just a fascine or a new sexy.
Their supervision and development tells some of the darkest and deepest cultures: the rate of generations to the stage of a generation, which is one option between others.
Of course, the largest of the men did not take a sexual robot, and their reward is still marginal, although the report of the FRR has also reported about their growing recommendations.
However, marginal appearances tell a lot of time about the spirit.
And many starts to be used easily or slowly since the markets give it a promise.
There is no doubt that sexual robots have started to overcome in the same time when women's rights have been struck in various pounds of the world and in the White house, the President who has developed to hurt women.
The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattar) is not concerned about its powerful icon, for example, pictures of broken body and out of the smooth eyes. It is the way the realistic world feels.
From the field of Gilead is far from our reality, but now it seems to be a surprising way.
Sexy-robots are trying to make so many real women (in pornographic conditions) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their feelings from the ground and moves to follow the most possible human movements.
However, their "personality" are far away from reality.
Robots can't go out of the relationship or situation.
They don’t have their own will or historic — nothing to refer to self-independence or to the perfect exemption fantasy.
They're favorable servants.
Orjatary.
Police remarks: two terrorists planned Australian, group leader of Dad's Chief
The Chief of the Northern Agency, the Chief of the father, led the group of the Australians, which was immediately planned by the last bomb from Etihad Airways to the airport.
The person who was in the father's leaderships was Sydney Morning Herald also sent Sydney's structures.
According to the hypocrites, the bomb was to bring to the airport on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the safety assessment.
The police don't tell me why the company has been interrupted.
The second exploited terrorist plan was to build a industriel coloring equipment and to bring the device to a public location, for example to public travel.
The Australian Association Committee Michael Phelan says that the terrorism plan was one of the most professional plans that has ever been done in Australia.
Four men were held in police rates because of the unreasoned terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released free, but also his accounts are continued.
That's a good half of thumpins?
Get Mit Romney to show the health of the original picture
In the train of Trumpin has already been turned to surprise that the power of the voters has also explored their families in the field.
At the courses of Jule and Thanksgiving, the advice of American advice officers were learned how Trumpia and the Trumpia voting families would be done.
We all want to purify our information collection.
Better, Trumpe has left the ability to join families.
I'm telling this, because my shirt was cut off this week from me in New York, and he's a lot of a left-mixed man who has been near with our communities.
He remembered that a joint enemy could be a powerful impact.
Now when Trump is in the white house, all my shirts are talking about – also the republicans who have rejected the political relationship with him for ten years — are along with the same side.
It is a good thing on the dayboard, but more than the thoughts of it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left mission a new virgin, but his president's wrong effect can actually bring us to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the fearful opportunity that we don't have any time any more to be scared of his temperator.
In the longer time, there is still more comfortable possibility that Trump normalizes the right strict republicans that, compared to the Trump, affect the same ones as the same.
I recall that Mitt Romney's silent version of the crazy: dogs in the bottom of the car, 14 per cent of the tuller (and we have seen it). In the contrary, Trumpy, they affect very late crimes.
When Trumpin has gone out, the next presidentship of the Republic needs to be clearly, and it feels immediately awareness.
When my shirt was coming to me, we brought our children to the Middle Coast Carusell, which is the biggest carusal and best carusal in New York to get three dollars without coffee.
The horses of the Carussel are powerful, among the chariots — the cares and the horrors look back to animals – are bad, and the multiple music that is in the ground is amazing.
Many of the New York's tunnel pipes are delayed for a time later to be disappointed: visible from high buildings begin to surprise, the cities of the city will be found too much and the reality of the city will not respond to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, you have been entirely able to be more than that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage smoking but a large movement field in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is really a Swiss, but it is not calculated.
Instead of the middle carusal, it is still a famous life – even that from two years, one of the eleventh and two fourth-quarters women have enjoyed it strongly.
I would have given the entire points to the chariots if someone had asked me to assess my assessment, but for happiness, no one came to ask.
Instead of this week, I was requested to assess the "the payment" stage of a five-seconds before I set my credit card to the card.
It's the same thing in my cabin in my household, but there is also the opportunity to join 15% of the service money when I'm going to get a coffee.
This cuts out the archive and presss the customer slave to set up his person in a situation where it doesn't need.
The soldier sold the basement with a lack of disagreement when I gave my credit card to the use of five stars.

Red meat, meat products and sugar can be moved to the smoke of the smoke
The red flesh and sugar can be heard of the painting of the food system.
However, the pure investigation states that the various proteins and carbon products contained can easily facilitate the sustainable consumption of the supply.
It is an increasing disease with an increasing disease from 1,3 million people in the United States and 3000,000 people in the United States in the United Kingdom. It causes wakas, safety, blood or blood of pressure, and extreme depression.
However, the investigators of the University of Washington Institute found that an aminohappo trip of protein in need to help the energy development of immune cells that strengthen the cycle of the cycle.
According to the research manager Marco Colonna, immune cells were guarded and ensures that the mixture microbits could not be hidden in food.
Cells for the future are compared to cells that strengthen the seatability, and they protect animals without prejudice.
If the equipment calculates too close to the future, the follow-up may be an increasing sequence.
In the tests, there were found that seat-to-tailability cells have a mouse that have certain bacterias in the safeguard.
The battery needs a thryptofanie to start immune cells. The Tryptofani is one of the protein structures.
The Lactobacillus reuter is a part of protecting normal microbiology," says Professor Colonna.
"What more of the brain eating was thryptofania, and more they had such immune cells."
If the same works with people, Lactobacillus reuteral bacteria and a largely thryptofania combination of foods can strengthen the safeguardability and reduce future heatness.
In the investigation of the immune cells, the Officer Louisa Cervantes-Barragan found that, although one group had such cells, they were not the same mouse mouse, which were held from the other group.
He understood that the mikrobioms of the brain of the museum, including the normal bakterie, the posts and the virus community.
When the brain protection DNA was studied, six bacterials were detected with the mouse with immune cells, but not with other mouses.
When the Lactobacillus reuters were given in the sterile environment to growing mouses that had no microbiology and not developed immune cells, they started appearing immune cells.
The researchers wanted to figure out how batteries affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the steel and moved small floor – without bacters – the mouse to separate immune cells.
Immuun cells were developed as strong as cells.
When the active equipment was cleaned from the lake, it was shown as a manufacturer of the thryphoana-production, which is known as indoli-3 country.
When the investigators double-lined the number of the cycliphophona rate of the mouse, the number of cells confirmed at least 50 per cent. When the number of thryphona was decreased, the number of cells were based on the front of the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same powerful cells as the mouse, and most of us are Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our foods.
It is not yet known that you can get the tripfoan site products of Lactobacillus reuteri-bakkers to develop people in the same way as the mouse. However, in the diseases of the treatment of the thryphofania has been obviously obviously obviously.
"We are sure we want to promote the development of such cells, because they are determined by the internal future," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"A strong cryptophosis attached to Lactobacillus reuteral bacteria can promote their publication."

Moreover, the helicopter prepared in Connecticut had shown from Main, Wisconsin paloauto, and stick of Mississip.
The white home military office had requested a place of helicopter for a task only about 36 hours before the southern throat of the "excluding outcome" documents of the HMX-1 helicopter.
"I just wanted to ensure that you are aware of the matter, because there is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 had written the event in the previous day of the electronic position, a representative of the marine aviation command.
The message was reported that the helicopter would come to the southern room, 17.7. tomorrow, and the event would begin three days of the evening. The helicopter would be removed from the place after the night when the plomb was empty between six and nine.
Moreover, the report was stated that if the helicopter was departed from the White House, there would be a second husband required for the limits of the services.
The original husband was in the event of the helicopter, and the unit of security was near the helicopter when it was in the country.
The documents of the TIME report could not be found if the other man was finally required.
The Hatch Act of the United States refuses the national employees to use national property for political purposes.
According to the documents, the HMX-1 scientist is a crime law.
"A one of our questions was, if this Hatch Act was crimed, and it was told us that it wasn't a crime," wrote the commander.
"Let me hear that you can participate," the assistant adviser answered.
Made in America was an official event of the White house, so it didn't hear Hatch Act.
But the official events have political shoes.
In the meeting of the President, he spoke to the Secretary-General on the treatment of the Health Research and the most founded government rule.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One lencoon is not a new light.
The Presidents must use them on the roads,
But their use only for photographs is impossible.
The Trumpin Agreements were noted in February when Air Force One rounded the president's campaign in Melbourne in Florida. Trump is strongly criticised to use the presidential airport in Twitter.
"The Old House is very happy to make Made in America, in which the American workers' material products from all 50 parts of all States are presented by the White Reporter of Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 members regularly make educational provisions in the region of Washington, and in the southern southern branch, to bring the President to the White House's center check.
When Trump was in the G-20 Hospital Conference in Germany in the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 exchanges to the White House.
According to a officer, Made in America was a monthly educational training.
One helicopter was also threatened on that day for 11 hours in non-President support.
According to the white house, the event has not been caused to other blood payers.
The Sikorsky reported that the company had not agreed to organize the presentation of the helicopter on the south of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have a library of the aeroplanes relating to the President's tasks, and the strict evaluation of the consumption is difficult.
The Ministry of Department in 2017 says that the VH-3D helicopter replaces 24 380 dollars from the airport.
According to the HMX-1 unit documents, the aircrafts from Quantico support from the Virginia State to White House and returned all hours.
The white house, according to the helikopter's use costs, are clearly smaller.
"The calculation of the costs of the replacement, according to the replacement, is a lot of guidance," says Walters.
"Assessed replacement includes personality, goodness and many other costs such as mentioned, which are taken into account in annual measures."
According to the scope of the RAND investigation company in 2015, replacements are not included by persons, but are taken into account the costs of burning, respective and agreement.
At the time of the convention, Sean Spicer was able to use the helicopter in the case of the white house.
"It's an American production," said Spicer.
"I know that Sicorsky and Connecticut States are very happy of that they are in order to ensure national security and to work through it, probably, hundreds of people or thousands of people.
And I think most of the American ways, we are honourable of the helicopters and other half-term training, which many Americans have done a lot of work.
It's totally important to import."
It's not sure that Trump's been in the event of the helicopter, but at least, he's moved to the place of the passenger.
In the white house, Trump was able to publish from the Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said President, "I have three."
He's going to go to Westan-rad, and the jungles are going to be replaced in buss.

Toilet Turists to the regions culture
The authorities are intended to restrict their tourist number in Vietnam.
The local race is particularly focused on risks to promote tourism.
The Italian Cultural Ministry calls it "eat and flee" to the turismo: in the case, it is only a few hours, and we are raised in the largest groups of visions.
The Virginia has to be able to cut down the town's tourists.
Caveways have a hard move and great opens are so full of visitors that the Vietnamese residents can't go to a group.
They have been struck to move a lot of historical discussions in the same time when hotels came to home.
The New York Times and The Guardian are written to the Turism’s problem in Vietnam.
The authorities are able to restrict restrictions to the turismo.
They're calling the current appearance as a bad turismo -- low-quality tourism.
When it comes to a large risk, it will be given two or three hours.
Following the teaching of Piazzale from Rome to Rialton and the San Marcus Tor, and turned back, describes the Italian Culture Ministry of Dario Franceschin, the supervisive and problems of tourism.
The beauty of the Italian cities is not only in the architecture, but also in the fields, cities and workplaces.
We must keep this part of the city's identity.
The Holy Markus story also includes the most recommended Vice-State History Centre.
The tour is located in the church of the Holy Mark.
In addition, local extents are compared to the main risks.
In the Virginia history, there is more than 500,000 locals.
In 1951, citizens were about 175 000.
In July, 2 000 Venetians were considered massaturms.
With them, the turbulency has disappeared their lives, destroying the environment and leaving the inhabitants away.
It's about 20,000 dwellers every year.
If this continues, a few years ago, it's not like a turistan.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical katastrophy, says that in the organization was Carlo Belframe.
One is hard because the starts support the needs of the results in Vietnam and keep the need for several different areas to work.
In addition to the restrictive target of tourists, the solution is that the cross-christs would have gone a longer historical debate.
In Vietnam, Luciano Bortot's situation would be sure that if Veneto's Government region is located in Vietnam, there would be more power to decide on its own matters - without fulfillment of autonomies.
In Vietnam, there are about 20 to 30 million tourists each year.
You're going to go to Moopi?

Even in the border area of 50 kilometers, your transport has been proposed in the day of the torped day, however, in the use of traveling.
The data were passed on the evening day at the Silina Sea River, or on the golden roof.
I'm very expected without such attention.
23-year-year-old smoking has been able to note the pains of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published beautiful images in the Grand Canyon countries.
The Danish Norwegian Amalie Iuel has been raised in the current house in Norway as an urhelier, not at least because he had violated in March 26 years old north prevention 400 meters in 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 55.38 amounts of 400 meters of driving in Norway.
In fact, the social media that Iuel used was soon after his predictation was noted that the publicity and the publicity had to be guarded.
Mans around the world began to send to Julia their families images clearly in the hope that the young officer would be interested in them.
I wanted to shut his Snapchat's style out of the outside.
I received a lot of "thistic pictures" from unknown people, so I was going to change my account in private, Iuel told the VG book.
Iuel didn't want the VG disorder to identify what images he got.
You're sure you're thinking, Iuel Nauru.
It's nice to get back after it's gone, but I'll be very hard without such attention.
Iuel was born in Danish in 1994.
His mother's Danish, Daddy Danish Norway.
Iuel's family changed Norway for 2 years.
In Amalia, 12-year-old family changed his father's work first to Namibia, then to Pakistan.
After that, they were in Dubai, Thai and the United States.
Iuel visited four years of University of Southern California (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned Norway.
In June 2015, he changed the Danish citizenship to the Norway citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel was raised by Leif Olav Alnesin, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Delium.
In Norway, we have much more open to discuss than in the United States.
The Governors in the United States do not ask anything, but they give only provisions.
In Norway, Iuel said to VG is more time to be personally done in the officers, in Norway.
Amalie Iuel needs to handle Norway's preventions at 400 meters and 400 meters.
My feet brought the lighter Janne Korven to the whole room of the MM-shirts, "Morry if there's no ground."
Now it's been nice when it wasn't hungry!
In this ship, Janne Korpi, 31 reading to the most progressive lighters, can be able to reach the love of their flocks again.
Last month, you've been on the ground.
The football broadcast was able to escape Corven’s board in January, and no feet wanted to be improved.
The hand was taking a part in the kiss.
In the midst, I didn't know what I'm going to do.
The sponsoridials were on the road and many things opened, Corpi says.
But so it says that things have a way to order.
After my best, the sponsor continued the agreement for two years, and the blood started again to get into the rock.
The continuing decision was easy after that.
I knew the last time I went on the ground.
I was that shit, yes, this again is so funny, we're going to take a couple more.
Corp could be able to calculate well in August, but after the long calculation, only the unfair treename has been a big thing.
Beauty Korpi just got a few.
It doesn't matter.
The kitchens have never been the most important aspect of the plot.
I've never been calculated for one kit.
I think it's amazing to star for four years in a single, and then you're even in the week.
I don't think so, Corpi says.
Today, Corpi is in the half of MM-shows in the Spanish Sierra Nevada.
Although the individual kids don't keep him in the park of the lips, he's always wounded.
According to the core, the evaluation of the basic assessment of the International Mixer Line in the past years has grown, although a part of the shipholders have also been chosen at the same time in Norway X-Gamesi.
Yes, these are important kids, the visibility is big.
I really think that the evaluation is always depending on what conditions and what levels are in the skins.
The body is an oldest urheil in Sierra Nevada in the Suomen 12-home groups.
In sometimes, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkine, are 14 years younger.
It's nice to follow younger guys.
I remember when I was in the step that everything was new and that was so sick about everything.
That's a new box, Corpi thought.
I'm still going to stay behind somewhere, but I don't know, it's like, there's a fucking guy!
On the back of the ground, Janne Korpi has also built a range of urgent rooms.
Management tendency Pekka Korven's son has been explored to the room: the shipman has its own railways he makes tree programs.
When I'm in the whole time, I'm not going to have it any more in the field.
But I'm looking at at least every day, at least, and generally something that's going out, Corpi says.
The railway reporting and monitoring are the potential basis plan when the rate is to be concluded during the period.
I didn't have to plan so long, but it's at least a real option.
I'm taking it so much as I learned it on this light board.
I'm trying to stay in the weather and develop, and maybe something outside.
If it's my future explosion, then it's not hard to start when it's already ready in the fields.
It also includes an elitlopete railway with Jaajo Linnonma.
Duplex has been declined by the risk party that directs to the end of May to the Turkey Elitlopete Railway.
Corp and Linnonma decided to resurrect the old tradition to the soul.
Ristely has gone a lot of business, and people have been injured.
Now we're already in the point that you don't almost come to the competition.
A couple of months is still time, we hope to get the ship full, Corpi says in the innocent.
It's all overwhelmed to Kite.
Attention Esteri is the name of the 41-year-old 41-year-old treatment.
The construction of 1 700 kerro-level meters in Russo is first prepared for the central health section to the nearby Health.
The general surprise is the subject of the new treatment of customers, for now many private treatment can be customers.
Anne Flink Attendol's officer commented that in the future, Kite has more questions except for alternatives to the efficiency of service.
All services are required, and when there are options, the choice freedom works better, Flink says.
I waited for the last year from Kitee's private treatment from Canervicole and Erika.
The ship is a movement, but it is, of course, a five-year-old agreement.
Flink says that Attendo does not need to move actions from these situations.
Let's get it later tonight.

"We hear all the seeds.
But if they think of our players, they're going to go to the following."
Barcelona seems to be guilty just this: it would appear to be his interest in the PSG media player Marco Verrad before this month.
PSG clearly made that it would not allow Italian to go out of any circumstances, but it may be well that Barcelona would lose this reason for her star player Neymar.
