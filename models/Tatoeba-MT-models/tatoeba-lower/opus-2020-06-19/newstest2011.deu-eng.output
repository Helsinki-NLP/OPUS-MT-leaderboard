What should they do, the CHSSD? The chechical social democracies in Prag don't know Voldemort or the "conditorial".
The new council managers of the main city of the CSSD are obviously needed to overcome some language barriers in order to understand their old new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city's representation.
The magazine currently.cz has been members of the new Council of the CSSD a little "concealed" as they ruled the notorical slang that has involved in the last years, in which the current coalition partners were in Prag in Ruder.
The codified word chat, introduced in the flowed era of the supervisor Paul Bem from the Prague Politic Elite, is described by some of the known acts, situations and Causee.
It was surprised that the new challenges in relation to these new terms were something in darkness.
They mean it at least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more newling in the Prager Politic," responded Lucas Kaucký, the new counseler for Culture, on the test of the "Patten Watch".
But also Mr Karel Brézina - a political veteran - reacted in similar ways.
For example, the word "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you imagine me here that I go and use again."
"And I don't have a lot of Slang."
From the word chat that the Tagbook was currently published in June of today before the election convention of the ODS, the redaction expressed six terms, especially those who are not to be associated with the Prager Magistrat.
The social democracies should define the terms "Voldemort", "Great Prager Golfloch", "Go to the Conditorials", "Sternament", "Right of the main town" and "Happy".
Three Prager Ratshers agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonin winert, the future chief of the Prager Schulwesens - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then he did not leave the hearer.
The fifth Ratsher, Peter Dolinek, declined the test from the forehead.
"These things I don't care, and how the citizens are talking about each other, I don't urge it."
"To me it is important how we understand in our programmes," he said.
As it has already been said, Lukeas Kaucký had not recognised that by the influenced companies and friends of the ex citizens Bem, Roman Janouschek is the talk.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing, and the only term he received correctly in the test was "the greatest prager golfloch."
"This is the white tunnel," says Kaucký, added to security, but still, "But I know it much more from the magazine."
And seriously, "I must have a language course."
The "Golfloch" will then not only be attached by Matador Karel Brézina, but also by the Council's Association for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachí as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both social democracies also know for whom the name of Voldemort is, and Lukaja Plachí is even where this figure is to find and that it also means "to go into the condicionary".
"I believe that it means to go in some practical gastronomy business," is Plachý very close to the Council resolution, if you know that it's about the seat of Janušek's company.
However, in accordance with Bruzina, he indicates that these knowledge are raised out of the magazine than that word protection would be his own.
As a result, the test participants seem to not to give the likely inhabitants of social democracies.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's nothing really with us."
"We call us in the name, go and again, we also use cuts or spitnames," says the president of the CHSSD Petr Hulinski - of his party-salop "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Brüza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues also call me so," says Karel Brézina.
The magazine Journal currently.c has tested the name and see it - it works.
Ratsher Weinert is aware of the party-genesesis of the "Opa" or less favorable of the "Ancient", representative Miroslav Poche, which has taken attention to the elections by masterships in the party-sponsoring, is called by some colleges "Igračk" (kenned Chess Lego-Figur).
Spitnames are the only one to allow social demokrates in the internal language.
Hulynish may not be likely if you call him "Hulda", but the Deník currently.c has recorded another Spitname of the President of Prager.
His spitzname "Doctor of the Gummiknbuppel Rights" has been able to do that Peter Hulinski has made his title Dr. Justice in the Bratislaver policekademie.
The Government wants to connect the impacts of "hexen" and gave a brochure out
Women that are treated in Burkina Faso in Hexen are usually shown some common society characters.
They are more than the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women's hair "weird," it will be strictly isolated, so that they can't be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Women are just involved by this shipsal."
"And young and healthy women, it remains along with the work and born children," describes a ordinary sister the situation in the main city of the West African Burkina Faso, in a special house, about more than hundred women who were exhausted from their communities.
The local government now decided to act against this abnormal "social measure".
And there was a brochure that should link the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hack.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," as the journal "derstandard" to the Dilemma of the Scriptural Declaration.
The hexery is observed, however, in other African countries, we have and weapon.
In Ghana, the neighborland of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahova was foolated from three women and two men to death - they overcome with Petroleum and simply throw them up.
The BBC server also reported about this case.
However, the tattoomen said that the matter would be just an unfair circumstances.
According to your version, the oil is a floor that will be used for ritual salts.
And however, after the group tried to "a bad spirit" from the woman to go out."
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without a view to their education.
"The Standard" quoted this to a 42-year-year-old companies from Burkina Faso: "Man's brothers are as a danger today."
While the Government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to explore the hexenjagd, the Gambian President himself has been directly communicated in the past year of the President.
"President Yahya Jammeh made a monstrous hexenjagd after his tongue's death, since they had an obvious part of their death, and now they would try to kill the President himself by black magic."
"Therefore, he called Shamans from the near Guinea to help that led women and men who were able to be held out of the range of Gambian travellers in Kanilai," the Organization of Amnesty International was reported in its report.
On the farm, the incomeed people were required to drink a disorder from plants with hallusinogene effect, but also the darm and neural problems.
Two of the organized people did not survive the residence on the farm.
First, because of international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released.
A mystery of Bakala: He's worthy in the oil - yet he pays higher
An older subjected man just leaves the client center of the RPG Bty of the "Cohlebarons" Zeneek Bakala, the largest privacy behaviour of locations in Czech.
Under the arm, one map with three new contracts to three rooms: for the own and the rooms of his daughters and his son, who just covers a ship.
All three were increased in the framework of the so-called. "Deregulation" just increased the measure.
Instead of 3500 crowns of the month, the son shall take place in the next year for a 2-room room apartment with the kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no fluent water in the room, and you have to be home in a simple coleofen," he says, "the finger is in the new middle contract of his son, to whom he has a full power.
"But what - I have signed," he explained half understanding and half resigned.
The BityOKD.cz, which is called "incorrect and unmoralist", is able to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, in which they think to publish a guidance against such contracts.
But the man's just winning.
"A one says this, the other this," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region will be so great to the "deregulation labour".
After a new year, this regulation is made to the most meetings in the Czech Republic, which are not sold for marketing measures.
Currently. and therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG Warterium in Havierrov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine hours tomorrow on this Sunday.
The Bodyguards are a security agent and a call device with her.
"Mite 2011", so lights a special keyboard box on the touch screen.
It's shortly attracted, and the device is already cutting a number sheet.
We've seen the number "157" and have already cut it on the great display at the deck of the warterium.
A half second later you're on the row.
Sometimes, an older married marriage has the warterium to ask after the threat, but the instorm in the warterium is not obviously applied to the new measure.
Most people are here to solve the normal problems - repairs, security issues and similar.
From the Middle November, Ostrava, the Cutters with the new contracts are the majority of the total 44,000 rooms of the RPG portfolio in the letters.
The RPG Byty offers them in writing a measure increase from 15 to 38 per cent.
The special scalter for the new positions in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs something about a week, which means that it's only the beginning," the ladies replied behind the shield after a moment of stealing when the "client" comes as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakals old mountain workers are a bright subject.
Before the election, the President of the Parliament of Ostrava, Lubomir Zaorálek, had taken this subject increasingly, no wonder that today the journals are full of it.
"I want a new football from them twenty years."
"WC-Brille could replace them," the income man mentioned air.
Finally, the employees are followed by the employees, in particular, in the field, to ensure whether they are really obtained the promised medium measurement that promises to them RPG if they sign the special rate rightly.
In the meaning of a half februarmite, the other measures shall also be signed to the new contract until 15 December.
It's a "deregulation switcher" in Havierrov, but it's all other than overloaded by questions.
"For the 360 customers were only about 40 to 50 of the middle in 2011," the officers estimated.
RPG offers, as well as on their websites, as well as wallmaps, individual measure agreements, where it appears necessary.
However, if the party don't have any of the new measures, it will be established by an independent court.
"It should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only possible and completely legal procedures," explains RPG on its website.
"Nobody goes before the Court," one of the employees of RPG Bity and a man on the street before the client center gives you at least part of the right.
"I have 13,000 (Krones) rents from me to remain 5000 for food, where I should take the money for a judge," he says.
Then the officers will be insufficient.
"See it."
"Mr. Zaralec tells them about the media, they should not sign and wait for people still," says they.
The regulated measure ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic 2011 and the RPG Bty is an economic need.
"The existing height of the positions is not sufficient to maintain the resident fund", argumented Pavel Klimeš, the Director of the Working Portfolios of the RPG Bity society, and - just the criticised explanation of the resident fund is according to the view of the main reason for the mine increase.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, the RPG could invest four billion billion in the rooms, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it must be 5,2 billion.
On the big formatted LCD display at the deck against the Polster Seasons in the Warterium of Havirerov, a few red lighting information is always shown.
"The rate increases in 2011 to 15% and less than 31 200 rooms, which is more than 90% of the RPG rooms."
"Always this means at least 7,50 CZK per square meters and month," is reading on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 rooms from the RPG portfolio, the rate is increased by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase of extremely small rate prices of 19,66 CZK per squaremeter," argumented RPG.
In 2600 rooms, the middle remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation is not striving in the height, but stepfully in four and eight years.
What more - the company is a further obligation: all income from the mount (see the diagram) will be replaced in the rooms, especially in the rooms - in new windows and in the room.
However, these must be worthy of those people who sign the agreements on the extent.
The architects saw - to the office is also a child garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
But whoever would wait here for a smaller garden, with all that it is: colored walls, creative mobiles, a lot of games, and even a mini-play room on the outer ground.
These children guarantees are available to the workers of Arch.Design since last year.
The projection and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the Ateliers are a total number of famous builders, received from the first designs for the new agropoint built with the rooms for their company minkinder gardens.
In wise preview, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the Babyboom old and the company, it is able to return projectants and architects as fast as possible to their workplace.
Along with the possibility of work, the children's garden is another bonus to offer the Arch.Design his employees in the concept of their social programmes.
Building engineers and architectures are so easier to bring their employment and children's officers under a hut.
The Minikinder Garden is a original idea of the cooperators (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management of the European Union and the Ministry for Working and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating minimum guarantee is financed by the operating programme of human resources and employment policy from the centre of the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (amount of 2,8 million CZK), the necessary institutions and equipment could be maintained, and for the period of two years, the qualified personnel and the operation is applied.
After the establishment of funds (2 years), the Arch.Design company is obligated to continue to contribute to the Minikinder Garten for three years to its own costs.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, while the society of Economic Rating provided a strong aid in the request development.
In order to take care of the children of a totally qualified person - a sister of sister and a kids guarantee, children can visit children without age limits, although most of them are older than three years.
And as it goes to a mini-kinder garden, only five children may be replaced simultaneously, however, the day of several children is changed.
The child garden operation is flexible to the need of parents, the children of all workers have regarded the same rights - without consideration to the companyhierarchie and their appropriate position.
Although it is involved in individual growth and phenomenon, the programme content in the Mini-Kinder Gardens is also comparable to the framework programme of the pre-education.
Children are not only playing here, in particular they will be commanded to be expressed, from basic recognition until to the predominal education, they also learn English.
The room is not only with games and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a peaceful and positive company mile.
Parents can look at the children every time and so the stress is fulfilled when the children get out of a lot of children's garden.
The parents therefore use their work time productive.
No wonder that there is also natural and loyal workers' relations.
Arch.Design was so attached to the chechnical companies offering clear benefits in the review of new collaborators, which are familiarly friendly and strengthen their personal marketing by such programmes.
A knocking house is also fascinated for 100 years. See the Interior of Gaudi
The dark must be like the back of a prehistoric exes, the tracts like the wireless cells of a dinosaurier and the balcones are cutting fishmulars.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catholic Architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the current inhabitants, the house with its organic forms received the name "Knochen House".
Organic shapes, wild colours, unlike use of stone, ball pitters and mosaics, remembering fats and generally different lines, all these are typical characters for the young style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fashion of the house is playing with smile lines, smooth colors and textures that remember natural and lives.
First, in exact view, you note that everything will be governed by geometry, ritmus and transparency.
In the night, the entire fashion is still plastic, dramatic and special lighting still increases the light of the colours.
The same low lines and corrupt forms also dominate the house inside.
Work formed wood copies the window frames, guarantees, shoes of doors, even guckletters and shoes.
The house Batlló in the fourth Eixample at the busy buying straight Passeig de Gracia No. 43 was made by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The rebuilding took two years in response and was finished in 1906.
The investor, the favorable industry Josep Batlló, was originally raised on the absence of the old and the building of a completely new building, but finally he approved Gaudís's idea to an increasing and balanced construction.
The Mietshouse Casa Batlló destructed Antoni Gaudí not alone.
He worked together with the Architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On the other hand, the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality behavior and the use of Mosaic in the fasad was his idea.
However, in the establishment of the fasad, many more pictures and artists worked.
The common work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the building of Gaudís House Casa Mila in Park Güell, where there is also more works of Antoni Gaudí.
Soon after he was completed, the house came from the named inhabitants of his organic forms because of the spitname "Knochenhouse".
Others again called the special window opening mechanism because of the "house house".
It also says that the sword of the Holy George, the patron of the Catalonia.
However, more picturehouse elements symbolize hidden religious motive.
Gaudí was designed for the house for the time of a single central heating system with explosion channels and typical camanes.
Something weird has to have their 45-grad neighborhood.
In his ships, the Gaudia ignored, consists of all that building rules, and did not act for these.
Before the beginning of the building, he received the appropriate construction approval, but the data made by him on the planned reconstruction were so weak that the town fathers were two years later when the fulfillment were so raised by the result that they requested help.
The Council managers also believed that the building with its arrows even in the public citizens.
However, there was no more changes — only 15 days after the requirement of the city, Joseph Batlló made a request to approval the two highest Stockworks of the house - and it was offered to him prompt.
The household himself entered into the lower stages.
In the gallery in the 2th Stock there was a company salon, in the third Stock the rooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The earthquake was explored in a juvilian business.
The entire six-six-six-sized buildings travels a track up to the ground race.
By the elements of the environment, all the right angle and just lines have been replaced and replaced by the mud and cutting walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept on the contrast of rooms.
The society part could be completely connected by the opening of the Salonures, and so could a larger society be able to be able to be able to be distracted without being confident to a certain intimity.
The house was obtained by Gaudís Umbuu, except a new fascinate, also a right injustice and two other Stockworks.
Impressively, Gaudís is also game with the light and the blue and white glass balls, with which the internal hole is dressed and the light height.
The game of these two colours gives all the steads of the house a maximum rate to light.
In that way, he delighted the principle of use that the white light reflects better than dark colors that absorbed the sun light in the same way.
The house Casa Batlló, which 2005 was taken in the world-wide list of Unco, can be visited today.
In the first Stock, the most cleanest and precious apartment of the public is accessible.
The households decided only in the year to this step, and this was from the date of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was determined that it was a right intermediate business, it was maintained the surveillances, and it also was raised on more common and rooms, including the shipping race.
However, the price for the monitoring of the structure is not a pattern style, which has 16,50 euros, students, renters, groups and containers of tourist exhibitions receive 20 percent.
This amount is overridding the income prices to other Gaudí buyers in the city.
Whoever wants to learn the real atmosphere of the house with his drachen shirts, should try to close friendship with one of the households and visit him home.
The right matratze and the right bed growth? Women have other desires than men
Not the greatest training, but the quality of the skin - so matratze and rost makes the good bed.
However, these must be harmonised to be justified to the desires of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health status, and not the last generation of the slider.
It is also important to the interests in which matratze and red are submitted.
A typical example?
In a weekend in which it is not regularly hidden, latexmatrates are not appropriate because they need much longer to be "warm".
In addition, they are obviously serious than normal Polyurethan matrats.
And - they should be guaranteed regularly.
If they do not have enough dilution channels in the kernel and still stand on a fixed plattform, it becomes weakness: So it isn't excluded that they are drawn under their shields.
Of course, the choice also plays a role to which you are used.
Whoever was a longer time in the outland where very high matrats are normally with smoking, it will be difficult to win a lower matrats with hard overground.
"I wish all Eishockey players who have come back from the NHL have considered me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their broken shoes, ferses and capses, they just need a change from Visco Shaum (Memory Foam - a forming polymer)."
"This is also the recommendation of sugar disease people who are disturbing the nervous system, so that they can receive the "Information" from the skins and the hair," says Sylva Hadamczik, who is specialized on the polstermebel.
That is why I have been a lot of Eishockey players before years, but also other customers have visited these matches with Visco Shaum (Memory Foam).
"Today, this is not a problem, because such matrates offer the manufacturer temperature, the Italian company Magniflex or the Chess producer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous Eishockey player to appreciate the values of the Visco scheme.
This "wunder" works really easy.
The shadow optimizes its heights and forms according to the absorbed weights, otherwise he says that he is regularly increasing in the weight of the body.
It doesn't press anywhere that you don't want to go in the night as after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The Vicoelastic Shaum also provides protection from Dekubitus (Wundbrand).
In the choice of the matrix size, you should still calculate the length of the feet sales, so by 21 to 34 cm.
Man as a woman that is large at the 180 cm, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the slider should be available at least 90 cm length, together 180 cm.
In single beds, for example, in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are added.
The comfort is half and also for any visitors.
Furthermore, Ing. Helena Prokopová, the future master of Polsters and rooms, who have already been in the problem of the healthy sleep and the erognomy of the mobles and this theme also provides for schools.
In a double bed, each one needs a own road and its own matratze, but applies to buy, so that the matrats are also high.
In addition, nothing remains else than mounting the roses in different height, and it is not possible for each track.
Shaommatrates should be at least 14 cm high, matrats with feder skelet 15 cm, at least three centimeters to the forest and the enemy polster.
"In hand or on the hand, you can't feel the feeds at no case," he warned Helena Prokopy.
Each matratze makes a specific type of rost.
All pulsed beds with matratze and tables such as joined siamzwillings have nothing to look for in bed room.
These matrates do not laugh and the relationship can't worry what's already done and weak today.
And as one night is lost between 0.2 to 0.75 l weight, it is clear that the matrateses will be leaving for five to seven years to a rich (and stealing 7b).
It is also the reason that the fableutes of the World Beslogians, which have been promised by matratzens a long time of life from to 25 years, even living guarantees.
Every thing has her case and but.
And thus a practical advice of the handlers: In matrats of 120 or 140 cm bread, you should not smile the hygiene of watchable, declinable rates, yet recommends to use a mathematical shooter that you can easily leave and watch.
Even today, in general, maths of maths with rumble decreases, so that you get two half of them after opening (except important for the wax process and the gas machine size!), the manipulation with larger matrats, especially only, often as the unlike battle between David and Goliath.
Have they got a fixed platt in the bed instead of a road?
Get out of it!
Or at least for a bed for unlimited guests and for one night.
Even so, they should like to see the platt with smoking shoes (if there is no more) and matrats with feed skelet and 15 cm less height with steel feeders and enemies.
Polyurethan matrats do not belong to such a table.
For non-profit latex or sandwichmatrates, the weight of latex and cocos is always paid with a larger number of latex, so from 28 and more feder leaders, with the support of Lordose in the field and the possibility of regulating the latex ports.
In the production of lamelets, there are no matrats with feed skelet because they do not react to the ecological distribution.
In addition to the establishment of federal staffs, special flexible rolling modules are also required.
There is a special conference of the Federal Leaders that allows the Federal Leaders to deal with or so much that they can allow the pointually insects of the slider of the slider.
Of course, for men with wide shoes is a important thing.
There are even matrate manufacturers who have started to use the "herrenmaters" switch zones for the skin area.
The ladies are also thinking - they enjoy these weeds in the garden.
For the most vulnerable customers, pointelastic flow feed systems (Lattoflex) or roses with pointeload contact paths are also defined with multitorsion feeding.
The pressure is divided on several points, which reduces the scanning.
But - if you use a bad (to great and full) head kiss, most of the benefits will be lost again.
There is also a smoking rule: the head box should support the head, its skins should only be rich to the skins, so that the smokes can be able to smoke.
Ideal therefore appears to be a 50 x 60 cm big kitchen, as it likes the scannavier.
In the page layer, the headbox should compare the heights of the heights (concommitted with the raw or smooth area in the matratze).
Something has made our modern matrats with the single (wheel filled) strokes together.
Moderne manufacturers always use natural materials or at least their animals.
Also in Matratzen, the new sauber word "Bio".
Instead of agricultural olive substances, it is always useful to produce polyretaine shoes of natural oil, for example, ricinus and soja oil.
Soja will be used by all known manufacturers.
"It's called in matratzens that her neighbors are pure natural origin," explains Peter Vascheczek from the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used to produce maths of gas - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy micro capsules that extend fresh wood or lake dust when sleeping.
There is also a difference between men and women.
While men are used a "coolinger" planning extret from birken blows to absorb the weights and to buy the body, the weights for women "warmende" have the effect of women.
Extracts from Red Papricascots reaches the blood circulation, which is low generation to sleep.
And the favorites today?
Matrats from Caltschaum (he has larger porches with destroyed cell structures and therefore is more atmosphere than the commercial polyurethan and much flexible).
With the combination of various steeps (heights) of calt shoes and Visco shadows, multi-zone-materials containing exactly where heads, heads and feeds are located.
However, for a high-valuable matratze, you have 7000 crowns and more.
However, health policies are usually loaded with smaller multivalue level because they apply as medical assistance.
As the first Czech Employment Gumotex was shared by this property.
You see to save the matratze and the red is not so easy.
In and again, there are special offers of manufacturers and manufacturers offering two matrats for a price.
So the Mark Magniflex offers the Matratze Duofnessee matratze with the covered Visco Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second gets free to it.
It was the material temperature that introduced the surrounding of vicoelastic shadows with open cell structure and high depth in nearly cosmic time.
No wonder, they have been developed for the NASA because the astronauts have been carried out at the start.
The temperature is weak in the weather, in the cool Mileu it is rebuilding.
So it corresponds to the human body perfectly and divides the body pressure in optimal ways.
Therefore, it is not only ideal to prevent pressure burning, but generally increases the dream comfort.
Viscoelastic shadows are not only used in matrates, but also in other health products such as in special footballs to produce the bones and the woods.
Use anheim manufacturer, for example, Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
Always more parents want human monitoring devices to have kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing, and it is always more parents to monitor them by GPS.
The system that was originally invented to build in cars can also make good people, as well as in such cases, as long as the disappearance of the nine-year-year-year-year-year-old Anička Janakaova.
The device is currently so large as a cygaret shop, but soon it should not be greater than a armband driving.
Many people have moved the case of lost annička in fear and fear, and so they keep in the middle and ways of view to protect their children better.
In addition, for the price of a relevance of their privacy.
"We are trying to say all of us that there is nothing about heroesponding, but to reduce the probable possibility that it comes to tragedie," said Peter Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the GPS locators on the Czech market.
"I give you that it can come in a particular case to the use of such devices, for example, if you put it into the table without he knows it, but we had no such cases."
"Most of the customers really buy it out of safety," adds Pilin.
His opinion, but the child should always know what purpose the "shell" and how you use it in the case.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočk shows that a child, if it doesn't like to take such things, it's simply fulfilled.
"And very small children show great creativity if it is going to lose some things dependently if they don't want to control."
"If the phones started at the parent's great expectations, but they can be disabled as easy as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs. Bočk.
Their opinion also has been restricted if such a establishment really helps in the case of a attack.
"The kidnapper regularly controls whether the child has any electronic with himself, with which it could be issued."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring devices find a larger use, they would also seek these, since their sale would be safe from massive publication."
"In these cases the police crimes are always a step," says the psychologist.
However, it arises that similar devices can be helped by a pedofill by a plot attack.
Roberta Čech, following the RC monitoring company, offers local services as well as for cars, as well as for persons, can help the existence of such a device soon after the attack.
"The equipment allows you to set up so that it reports the corresponding position in some cases."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the involved person is available."
"Increasing equipment is even integrated a neglective measuring, which means if you are satisfied and staying without movement, the device is now sending a warning under the position," says Mr. Choch.
His opinion, similar services may also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, you need only to play a special software.
The problem of the current location devices includes that it is along with devices in the stream box size, range the attachments or smaller phones.
It's always the danger that you lose it.
Thus, Mr. Pilin from the Macro because you are tested in the present devices that look like normal digitals.
"This is the provision that any supplier should not be recognised that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Of he notices that after a certain time the police has a time forward," he adds.
Nothing in which direction the development will go to army countries or annexors, the same technology will always be used as at the vehicle location.
So to combine the location function with the GPS system (as like at the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many sunshines that you can develop the whole Chess, but only two years
The Czech Army has 445 kilometers of sunshine, designed with springs.
In the year ago, the Ministry of Defence has already delivered 224 miles of sunshnur to the army's army.
It is already fun to know that battle forces have been built for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the sunscreen - two, at least four years.
The army buyed the sunshine of the STV Group, e.g. for lappy 40 million crowns.
In its funding for the purchase of this powerful quantity of sunshnur, the General MF DNES, the soldiers would use annually 60 kilometers of sunshnur.
The search of Armeepyrotechnology, the MF DNES, has been considered that the whole army has to solve a very intensive pirotechnical education – from all generals and officials of the Armeekommandos until the Secretarys and Putzfraues.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondra and Armygeneral Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only so, the significant annual consumption of 60 miles of sunshine has been justified halfway.
This length is the rest of 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be rich for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts applies that for education of each new employee soldiers two meters of Sundschnur, the army has been completely established by these new buyers - even under the face of the highest needs of the pioneer and special units - a dramatic advice for 225 years mentioned.
Thus, the soldiers of the rapid injection forces were considered unfortunately during the Ministry of Defence of Vondra, they had almost no patterns for handwrecks, so that the weapons of the missing means were restricted by strong limits.
It's very weak from the underhosen man.
"I don't even agree why they're buying from us such an unmarried monster."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good client that we want to come as handmaster," says the STV Group Jan Dycky.
Jan Pejschek, the speaker of the Defence Ministry, based on the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of sunshnur, the army had been covered at least ten years with this "Munion".
However, Jan Dický from the STV Group says only about a four-year-year-old use period of sun-shirts and police and armeepyrotechnology only for two years.
"In perfect storage, it is also possible for the four mentioned years," one of them, but he wants to stay unnamed to be observed as soldier, not to observe the crisis on the army.
After the period of consumption, each munition must be condemned, if it is still allowed and not dangerous of the life of soldiers.
But these tests are not worthy, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity rating for the 445 miles of sunshnur.
"They costed us sixty percent less than the last year of delivery of 244 kilometers," says Sprecher Pejschek to the position of the income of the Defence Ministry.
Only in comparison: The annual consumption of South Snights of the police pirotechnics, the munition from the Second World War or the Swedish Brother Army is over a few years ago.
And the police always provides only such quantities of this municipality that they can still use before the consumption period.
Although the safety of the pyrotechnology is caused, it is also the possibility of flexible investment moderner and, therefore, opening the supplying sun-shirts.
The Ministry of Defence has not yet a major problem in the liquidation of ten thousand tons of tons of munition from the time of the Warning Treaty, when the Tchechoslowakian peoplearme was prepared on their field travel.
Following the pyrotechnics, the MF DNES calling, the Chess fight forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old sunwrecks that she has been so "good" today.
Today, the contacts I have won by the competition
The sergeous location in the concurrency "Klein employers of the year" helped Lukaja Pytloun to sell Francis his hotel.
The winning of the past year of the concurrence "Klein employer of the year" was Lukeas Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success must be like a film scenario.
Luke Pytloun's staying nice.
First in the outland, he knew that it was missing prices in Liberec for good supervisory opportunities.
From the expansion of his driving work in the foreign and with a bank credit, he received a bathroom with five apartments.
If you remember that he was a high school student in the sixth semester, it was sure it was a mutual prisoner.
"The damage price-quality relationship was deceived by me, and so I tried to take something ahead," said Luke Pytloun.
The first rebuilding apartment, he refused foreign workers.
The entire winning he immediately invested to the house that he then built a step to pension with 54 beds.
Seither had only seven years of business activities in Liberec four pensions, two silent restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all business categories.
The most comfortable of them was until the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In this year there was another classic hotel.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, which we sold our France concept and reported more interests in the Francis of Pytloun Hotels," says the company number One from the past year.
"Great part of this license for hotels was just the wind in the concurrence "Agency of the Year", added to Mr. Pytloun.
The victory has introduced him greater knowledge, even popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, sometimes they're welcome to me even night and I need to say that's right," he remembered.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to share in this competition.
You don't need to win the same, every viewing is good.
He says that he will benefit from the contacts and knowledge to whom otherwise it would not be.
"For some people I have taken thanks to the competition, I will discuss regular business relations until today."
The honour associated with success is also a little down to each of his cooperators.
And there he has the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and honour that they are part of something to share the general recognition."
I really see this not only as personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name's just a thing in the front," says Lucas Pytloun.
My followers want a more calm year when we had it in farmet
The shooter was quickly deleted from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his target effort, Farmet has the worst behind himself.
The price for the first rate of the Concurrence Vodafone Company of the last year took Karel Judiarski, the company's owner of Farmet.
The jury would then achieve the efforts with which he struck a company from the small tool building in Czechska Escalaice from the ground, which makes hundreds of millions of grounds.
"I can say that this conscience is not only me, but also all my cooperators, and our self-consciousness has strengthened the competition," says the pre-year-year-old.
At the beginning of the company history of farmet, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state of his father Karel Judiarski as compensation for the property of the communists, he urged a small job place to pay, he not long, he left his carriers in the company where he was employed until there, and founded with a few camerads of his father's own company for the production of plastic weapons.
A short time later, they started concentrate on plant oil pressures.
In 18 years, they have increased automatic prices to the largest manufacturer in the middle Europe.
But only through the success in the concurrence mentioned and its mediality, it also has entered into the consideration of the non-public.
"It is not only that our customers make clearly intensive now, our foreign partners also started to cooperate with a company that has succeeded to the most possible success in their country," says Karel Judiarski.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of the seeds.
In 2008 and part of 2009, the competition was issued by the economic results of the company.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool-building products.
The crisis, which was still less than the citizens, but in particular the company, just got their high point - many companies were required to introduce their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"This situation, of course, we couldn't even go away."
"The measures returned to 40%, we had to be limited to the production and even to resolve," says Karel Judiarski
A living companie must also take such unpopular measures.
However, it was to get the situation in the griff and to keep the company in the black numbers, even if with smaller wines than before the crisis.
With one of the companies, the company was not forced to make abstract - investments in research and development.
"Besides the Committee, we built a research and education centre, we strengthen our presentation on international meals and increased main prices in the Indian Explanations," says Judician.
Everything proves that we have overwhelmed the crisis.
The measures grow again and the number of new cooperators are also with them.
"The new Sieger I want a lot of joy in Sieg - but in silent atmosphere," allows Karel Jewish.
A question of opinion which is required by non-increasing rules
The opinion question on the "Average of the Year" is the fourth part of the competent competition.
Some unclean rules have already been made to create from the world.
For the successful winners of the next year of the opinion "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents to the authorities that are available online.
So he decided more than one third of non-including 4000 companies.
So, the social security management requested a paper out of the trade register, even if the office could have taken him by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion question, this is now changed.
"The Czechical Social Security Management will not require any further expenditure from the trade register, in the future in control of social security numbers."
The meaning and the purpose of the opinion "Asurance of the Year" is to take all rules and regulations under the clusters to fulfil the companies in the Czech and to uphold the unclean.
This is already in the fourth part of a competent competition which is established by the economic time (HN) and has been achieved in the public growth.
In the past year, when the three thousand persons participated in the vote, they were already four thousand in this year.
No wonder, for there is still a lot of legal obligations to serve only and only to prevent the company.
"What, for example, the number of income structures, we take a previous range in the world," notes Karel Havlíček by the agreement of smaller and mediterraneous companies and supporters of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business activities is the proklame objective of all governments in the past years.
In comparison to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has not been increasingly.
According to the information of the World Bank, the Chess takes place in relation to the conditions of the company 74. In comparison to the year, an eight bad location.
The concurrence of the year was first called in the year and played each year after the same scenario.
Every man can report from April to the end of the competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic unsensus.
To login, the Web address www.firroku.cz. Following the concurrency's representative searches for seven candidates for the "antiprice" and allows the public on the Internet on the website www.firmanroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihmed.cz.
It seems the absurdity that most of the voices gets.
For this year, more than hundred years of opinions have been attached to 105 senseless rules and regulations.
The tips are not only of companies, but also of employees and journalists.
For example, under the "finalists" of the competition, there are also provisions to pay steel vehicles for vehicles and rapid trains, or that companies with twenty cooperators, two offices and two toilets have to provide each two years.
The directory of this year "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call of the competition at the beginning of November on the Prague Wenzel room is a part of a happiness in which regularly also share the personalities of the political and public life.
For example, in this year, Eva Svobodova, the Director of the Conference, and the Republic of Chess Republic and Peter Kužel, President of the Tch. Republic, at the high point of competition with the parties.
"Which the State carries to the companies between the feet, it is not possible to give real economic exchange, therefore it is my goal to raise at least three-third paragraphs which are today in need for the companies," said Martin Kocourek, the Ministry for Industrial and Trade.
The efforts to create unclean arrangements from the world show the effect.
In 2007, most of the companies committed the obligation to report the office in the place of their continuous office three days before, with a state of exhibition or crisis.
This obligation has been taken into force of a Novell of the Water Vessel.
The obligation that 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report the workshops of employees at the beginning to 30 days - was made by the law on them too. "Green card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the draft Regulation was chosen to have a speech in the speaker room, a smoke and two persons carriers.
This Regulation has been amended by the Health Ministry in this year in some terms, and the cockpit obligation has fallen.
A new category requires society responsible companies
Rating criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A newness in this year has already been the fifth year of the competition of the Economic Time (HN) is the category "the responsible companie of 2010."
The principle of this competition is to promote comprehensive and efficient undertakings.
"We want to support such companies that are undertaking the consequences of your business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, the caller and guarantee of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For the first year, this special subcategory of the main competition of Vodafon Company of the year, the companys were not the only long-term goal for the success.
The story of each of them is extremely inspired and offered enough substances for a self-controlled article.
Although they are different from the presence of their activity diameter, their efforts have also been a common support and attention.
This is, for example, about human beings, because of personal problems or health of their own cooperators.
In the fourteen Financials of the whole Czech, such as the Prague Software Company Et Netera, which promotes the development of non-formal sport teams under their companies, which then participate in several tours in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo society, which is the main officer of a steel fund for children employed for seventy years.
In the context of Vodafone Company of the year, a paper factory of Podebrady is also an example of concern for their healthy employees, which explore 70 per cent of their employment, for which it has been conferred with the Title "First responsibility company of the Middle Bohems" in the Concurrence of Vodafone Company of the Year, it has been able to achieve the third range in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the bookhold company MiRyz Soft, which carried out a flowing and also a average of 35 hours per week, reduced work time, and it was unrelated.
The jury also honored in the title distribution the circumstances that the companies preliminaryly purchased in chemical manufacturers, supports citizens initiatives in their environment and works on environmental principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to maintain the consequences of our companies' activities and administration for the environment less possible," explains their business manager Miluše Rykanarová.
The responsibility of the IT companies Enlogit from the Usti over Lab region is the health of his cooperators, therefore it has contributed to all notebooks to the technology and keys, and also contributes to their employed homework and in business actions, they use Carring Services that are required by a home protected work.
"In addition, we support the Stiftung "Man in Not", which provides a specific aid of the Roman community," says Ondřej Searchý, the representative of the company.
Not last is also the activity of the cleaning company "Pranie a cleaning" from the Karlsbader region, which includes their employees in the form of extra bodies for their relief safety.
"We guarantee our employees' contributions to the employment, for the work path, to increase their quality and for the ransom," says Josef Strapáč, by the Building Company Czasch from Bruntal, the winter in the Maritime Shles region.
For the category of responsibility undertaking of the year, all employees of the Concurrence of Vodafon Company of the year were automatically announced, responsible for the questionnaires of the announcement and sent it to the advancement until 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in question bows were excluded by the representative of the assessment.
"When the representatives of the companies have not responded to the questions, they were excluded by the concurrence of "the responsible companie of the year" in the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year, they were not disqualified."
"A separate login is not possible only to this competition because he is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman by the organised Agent Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Funds - Police offices in a public statement
In the building of the ground fund in pills, the anticorruption policy adopted in the last days.
In this case, Luboš G. was carried out from the detectives in trade challenges.
This has also tried to manipulate a just placed public concurrence for the development of restitution requests so that the principles offered in the competition may apply to a specific interests.
This would have paid Luboš G. for a half million.
"To this time, I can only ensure that the police have been persecuted by a public concurrence,” said Antonia Zelena, the chief of the Pilsner State of the journal "Pravo", could not provide more details in respect of the running investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old employee was released from the police.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, you can only speculate the special official information.
The speaker of the ground fund Lubomír Černá took the question of Provo, that the police had actually taken fixions in the field of the ground fund, and it was during a public competition.
"It's gone to a customer and to communicate for one of our collaborators," she concluded.
The public concurrence was followed by Mrs. Černá, in accordance with the correct indication "Requirement for the offering of requests to transmit bases in accordance with the ground-height" and would be in cases where several applicants would be interested in the proposed basis.
"Their persons offer a higher value of their resistance requirements compared to the transfer as the exhausted basic value."
"Because the requested requests are established by the order of the potential refunds, then the ground fund overrides the basis on the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G., obviously, had been available information that had been reported to the requirement and since he was a person authorised, since he had buyed a number of restitutions requests, he made a fundamental interest that he returns from the competition.
Obviously, against a fixed defense.
It would also be a sufficient statement, because he had such a great payment in his presence.
Luboš G. has already been in the past very good contacts with the ground fund.
So he also played in the Cause of the previous boss of the ground fund Vaclav Sankota a role, which was committed to criminally, since he was made in replacement restitutions, to which the local decisions were already pleased to build.
At that time Luboš G., for example, was founded from the ground funds, as well as baskets that were determined to build public roads, exactly said, at the place where the building of the agricultural migration was planned to the bourish area.
Afterward, he set this very good with the Magistrat against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeds the value of the baskets.
The Rathus had to have a hard heart-building in order to not risk the building by the blocking of the basic skins.
The residence costs of the budget increase a few hundreds of monthly
The budgets should not only be calculated with higher costs for all energy architectures, but also with higher water- and water-water bodies and for telecommunications and somewhere.
Thus, from January, a few hundred crowns have to go a month more from the portemonaie.
Strom is to 4,6 per cent more lower, gas to 2 per cent and more, in some cities you need to pay more than a decade for water delivery and also protect the telecommunications.
Only the aircraft is costing a few hundred corners in year.
The sterchstrom prices have been submitted by all the main suppliers, so it is the clear promotion of the electricity production from renewable sources, namely from photovoltacakes.
However, the gas will only be weaker, but it is exactly if people have to be in most and have the highest consumption.
So here also is to calculate more than a few hundred corners per year.
While the gas and the gas will be rich in the whole Chess, the prices for television weathers are different from the city to the city.
In particular, greater places plans price increases.
For example, the budgets in Pardubice and Hradec Kralové must be paid more than 50 crowns from January to 50, more than 1000 crowns paid families in Liberec a year.
The inhabitants of Prag reiterated 9 per cent higher water and water shoes, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure.
If it doesn't change, it's only 6,8 per cent.
However, the price in Prag is in comparison to the whole Czech continuously to the lower.
In the northern boat, where the price is now the most highest, water and water bottles must increase 7,4 per cent.
The energy prices are expected for example in 140,000 meetings, where the currency regulation will be disappeared from January.
For example, the CPI BY, which is in Usti over the lab of 2500 apartments, is planned to increase the positions from January to 100 per cent.
Whoever doesn't understand this currency, the company wants to be judged.
In the next year, the regulated measures that are still paying at about 300,000 apartments may increase more than 10 per cent.
Czech Children drink with Fernett and Room Bier is out - it's simply efficient too late
Fernet, Room and Wodka, except for a good whisky that he shoot his father from the household.
These are the challenges that the Chess Teenagers have to be treated in the most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep again in the hospital.
This results from the experiences of doctors that are compared to similar cases in the absence of children's separations of clinicals.
"Bear or wine are completely out of the mode because it's just too long until you drink."
"The current trend is clearly severe alcohol," says Provo Ludiek Pelikán, the Chefarz of the Children Division in the Mediterranean Clinic Horrovice.
"Whisky, if it comes to use the father a flash out of the household, and if not, at least the Internet or Woodka.
"Wodka has the provision that you can miss him with Juice, then he doesn't call so strong," said the Chefart.
The speaker of the Facultate Health Motel Eva Jurin's speaker gives him right.
"And most often it's about the Fernet or Room."
"This is the alcohol trend today, of course at basic schools."
"Unitedly, it was also about Slibwitz that you take from home," Mrs. Jurin.
Chefarzt Pelikán follows no exception in the hospital in three-four-four-year trinkers.
Before the clinic in Horizovice, where he worked since this year, he worked ten years in the Medicine's division of the hospital Motel, where the training cars were delivered from Nah and remote.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your carriers started with 12 years when she first had 3,5 promille alcohol in the blood and still had been introduced in combination with "Extase"," the doctor described a very serious case.
"She was in the holeshovice office in some dance party."
"The interesting was that her mother wasn't surprised that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the Chefarz wondered.
In addition, the missing interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in the achievement of their own springs is one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true meaning of the word, it does not follow experts with children.
"After alcoholism is a long-year chronic dependence of the alcohol and all the phenomenomen that are involved in it, and this is not the case of these children."
With those who enjoy alcohol again, there is a negative family-social background characteristic," says Chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital house Motel, Mrs. Jurinová, was introduced to the middle of November forty-four-five children in the holiday division for children and young medicine.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol exposure required by a hospital residence are in the statistics.
Third children who are carried out after a ambulance treatment of parents or if they are given to the police to house are not registered.
Furthermore, the cases in which children only drink a flash snaps in the school bank are three years old amplitudes, on the 100 percent of loss: Walpurgis night, Silvester and the end of the year of school.
"This last name is from two reasons - or out of the room because of the bad witness or of joy on the farmers."
"In the Walpur's night, I have also lived seven young children once in the arrest," says Dr. Pelikan.
A drinking child, who breaks the night under the heart, is better to do than a child to fight on the next day only with an uncomfortable chatter.
The head pains in the morning after the dehydration and the glucose mangel can be infected in the hospital with a flexible infusion with glucose and nutritional substances that are missing the organism.
"They are absolutely better to do it, because after the "here" experience in the evening, they're busy with a good launch, without doing something worse."
"They're just something confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, while he's at least worthy of the good launch by telling them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the saving car and the night is good in a busy bed and likes a couple of hundred thousand crowns.
"He and again I have used this as a remedial, if I directly mentioned the children at the visit, what their tricks have chosen, and that it can happen that they have to work on the whole frequency to pay the money for a single feet," added Dr. Pelikan.
His opinion, however, the hospital cases do not follow the regressive procedures to require the costs required by the parents to heal the threaten children.
Two training airports L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two easy fighting aircraft L-159 of the total five, who have expanded the Chechical Defence Ministry against the transport airport Casa C-295M, are floating in the Spanish city Sevilla, where the Spanish Airport Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time that the machines of this type are in possession of an alien army.
In the outside, they were only to see in the Manvesters or airports.
It is about the aeroplane dubiter version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The rest of three aircrafts are single L-159.
These are currently stored in Aero Vodochody, the representative of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken it last weeks.
When she expires the flights from Vodochody, Jean Pejschek is not yet known by the speaker of the Defence Ministry.
The single aircraft L-159 was further excluded from long-term aircraft, and it was without further investments and investments since the residence of the Ministry.
"The Double Sitz L-159T1 were exhausted in the present state and view," said Pechschek of the Provo magazine.
He added that the army should not go out without twice fighting aircraft, since the Defence Minister of Defence in May 2009 signed a 200 million contract on the construction of four overflow L-159 to the two-year-old version.
A new aircraft took the army in July, the second will take it to the end of this year.
The EADS has therefore committed to travel fighting aircrafts in the exploitation of one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty, it is clear that the EADS Agency is L-159 and that it should serve for the training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It's therefore the matter of the abode, in what way he realizes the matter," said Pejschek.
The Economic Time (HN) had first reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The trading of five L-159 against a carrier Casa and the purchase of other aircrafts for 3,5 billion crowns was made in the past year by the Government of Mirak Topolanek.
The Ministry of Defence had not been described for the purchase procedures, but the EADS said directly.
The total defence argumented, this rate will support the future export of L-159 to the outside.
The Czech Army buyed Aero 72 machines from which they only used 24, the rest wanted to disappear.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa has to have a judicial game.
The European Commission raised the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court, and the reason that the aircraft should be chosen because of a whole European exhibition and communicated by the responsibility of a single manufacturer.
The Army has already taken three aeroplanes Casa, the last will be landed on the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer indicator than Ringfinger means a lower risk to be sick
Mans whose indicator is longer than the ringfinger are obviously raised a smaller risk to be sick in the prostat rebs.
This is the surprised result of a study published in the Mediterranean of British Journal of Cancer.
This must be along with the speegel of the man's Hormon's testestron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of Prostatakrebs, and that is, of course, in men to sixty," said the mediterranean of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor of the carbon research institution in Warwick University.
The finger could help us to determine which men should undertake a prostat reb test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health loads, Mrs. Eeles added.
In 1994-2009, she persecuted more than 1500 patients with prostat rebs, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the indicator of the right hand was shorter than the ringfinger.
For these men the same probability of prostat rebs, as for 19 percent of those men who were ring and indicators were equally long.
However, the risk of this risk was 33 per cent of men to 87 per cent of men.
The relationship of the length of the two fingers mentioned in the presence age, obviously reflects the different speeds of sexual hormones which the child was launched in the gear mom.
Small teststeron corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous researchs have concluded that the teststeron has already decreased the growth of prostate rebs.
Vaclav Paches, Chess Genetics leader and an old president of the science's academy, said the CTK to him that this study was flightly known, yet he keeped the relationship between the finger length and the risk of the blood.
Chess in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
As the largest part of Europe is also the Chess in the Sunday morning under a sneeking.
On the streets and snow, the winter services were in many areas the whole night on the east.
The D5 car train between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is locked by some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prag.

There are also two Lkws together.
The drivers should take the same back to Brno at 190 kilometers or go through Brno and explore at kilometer 182 at the place of Kivalka.
There's a lot of miles.
Even on the D11, an accident has occurred and the same is the same when the income to Prag.
In Prag itself there is several cents of dick snow and the thermometer shows negative seven degrees Celsius.
For example, autocolumns are formed in the towneil Prosek, and the roads of steelbohols are totally hidden.
The safe carrier is in every case the metro.
The street travels go with disappointments, for example, on the line between Karl room and peaceplace.
At 8:00 tomorrow, the Prager Crisistab is together.

Most streets in the Southern Sea are only higher careful.
For Wyschkov, three neighbour streets are fully unsearchable, in the area of Brno's environment, snow reliefs and in the area of Blansko are required to put down a few higher steadfast streets.
One of the most concerned regions is Ausszkov.
There are three streets still locked completely: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučrov and also Saratice - Milešovice.
It also needs to be used to snow snows.
When they are reviewed, they can't be assessed until now.
In the Hodonín region, the white carpet is addressed on the area.
On the streets that can only be driven out of natural protection grounds with inches, one to five centimeters of dick snow snow, CTK has been carried out.
In Czech, two to ten cents of newsnee, most of the northern bowls were fallen to 18 centimeters.
In the Maritime Shles region, to 15 centimeters of New Snow falled.
But in Czech, it's gonna be snowing easily.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons".
The American forces have first used a new "intelligent" weapons that have been known only under their code label XM-25.
The generals hope that these new automatic weapons affect the conflict there with Taliban and move the strength relationship with their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a super-genual canon.
Their projectiles are therefore carried out by Laser with a safeguard of only a few meters to go in the target.
The special packaging of calibri 25 mm, which were developed for this weight and contained high explosives, are practically working as small granates.
The shoes can be programmed so that they can explore not only on the target, but on a favorite point of their ballistic airports.
This means that you can use them against a enemy who turns behind a wall or in the guard.
From above, he is usually not protected, and the murdering steel splits from above can easily set him outside war.
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, is the new battery of the first infanterial weapons that makes the "intelligent" technology to use.
"The soldier takes the basis: he shows the target and sends a laser radius that determines the distance, so he wins a exact viewer point after he corrects the higher angle, then he needs only to decrease.
"Let's say, you've got 543 meters."
"When you are pressed, the weapons are opened and shoot the coffee on the distance 5443 meters plus negative one, two or three meters.
400 Workplaces are raised
The Concern Fujitsu releases his desolation in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the next year, 400 employees will take their workplace from the previous office building at the Marinbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese Concern Fujitsu releases his desolation in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In the next year, in July 400 women and men are reported on the computer and their maintenance specificized broadcasts, their workplace will be released from the former office building in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a great office complex on the Lyon Street in Frankfurter cities Netherlands.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained it should be undertaken more than 100 more workplaces of the Concern, which have been distributed to the region.
The proposal was extremely attractive and the large offices in the astro Park of the workshops were better.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only a Miter.
The competent officer Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central location with an extraordinary infrastructure."
The excessive connection to the airport is just for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new environment of an important enterprise within the region called yesterday joy in winters and destructions with losers.
Frankfurter Economic Designer Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was a "Global Player" winning again.
That's a "excellent location recognition".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the design is an important impulse for the low-rad.
The Bad Homburger Oberbourg Master Michael Korwisi (The Green) understood Fujitsu's decision.
The city has been informed early from the business leadership on the defense.
"We, of course, offered our help to the company," said Corwisi.
However, peaceful contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the immobility in the marine bar.
Finally, economic reasons had been given to the proposal.
Now it's going to prevent a long space in that kind of prominent place.
"I hope that the owner and migrants of the building shows cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu in the Rathaus room and the inhabited "Kleine Vertical" was with the rest of the buildings in the Marinbader room for ten years ago to the most constructive buildings of the Curstadt.
As a common project of the city and a private project developer, a new citizenship of the town and Rathaus, which was concerned with the massive building of the grounds used as a parkplace, as well as the height of the buildings for critical buildings.
2001 includes Feri, the software hardware for traveling systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, once connected with Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was made by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consumers in Tokio are called the third largest IT providers of the world.
He provides companies, for example, computers and servers prepared and also provides the necessary service.
The reduction in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, however more employed Fujitsu in Munchen.
From Bad Homburg, the daughter company Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt Nederrad, which further daughter companys in this location should be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For that reason, the Astro Park is 7000 square meters in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old Complex - the name plays on his steel-formal basisrise - includes the central energy-electrotechnology and electronic industry its seat.
Amazon locked server - Attachments against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly dismissed.
The Internet Service Learner Amazon has interconnected the distribution platform from its servers.
It may be a political pressure after the publication of hundreds of secret diplomates.
Wikileaks green assange is obviously in England.
Wikileaks will always be stronger in the United States under decisions.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and now look for a Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Amorrman called in other countries and businesses to the bookott of Wikileaks.
And the Wikileaks grew Julian Assange, who is on the interpol's challenges list, should be maintained after a journal report in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks of Amazon server disappeared."
"Free talk in the country of freedom," the enlargement activists shared Twitter on the Mediterranean (Ort time).
Unfortunately, Amazon's Internet undertaking had linked Wikileaks documents from his servers.
The Internet activists were rejected by the publication of the secret diplomatic depths on Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to fix high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks further explained: "Prima - our dollars are now exposed to buy people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with the freedom of speaking, "they stopped to sell books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his server by Wikileaks after the workers of Senator Joe Loverman's research, reported the CNN telecommunicator at the office of lovermans.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee for Home Protection, the Amazon had made a boykot, reported the British "Guardian".
"I wanted Amazon to get this action before, in view of the previous publications classified by Wikileaks," said the senator.
The loverman therefore called the platform also in other countries to refuse the use of servers.
"Wikileaks' illegal, irrespective and irrespective progress sets our national security on the game and is dangerous around the Globus Life," says it in a communication of the party-senators.
"No responsibility companies - whether American or external - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to expand the locked material."
Wikileaks Greek Assange, which is searched for the violation of the authorities in Sweden, is on the Interpol's training list.
After a report of the London magazine "The Independent", the 39-year-year-old Australia in the United Kingdom, the exact location is known by Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has marked in Sweden as the inside of his owners.
Wikileaks speaker Christin Hrafnsson said that it was given drugs in London.
"It's even called after a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why fearing assengement for his safety, Mr. Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks greeds will therefore continue to be hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to excuses from North America.
In America, the previous Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the responsibility for Wikileaks commitments should be attached and established by the Council.
In Canada an advice of the Governing Board Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - in the TV, Assange should be killed and Obama could use "a drone".
Thus, between the white house and the assange burned a smoke.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughly and absurd" that Assange requested the return of the Foreign Ministry Hillary Clinton, if she was responsible for the most recently known spionage requirements on diplomates.
"I'm not sure why we're looking for the opinion of a guy with a web page," so Gibbs.
"Our external policy and the interests of this country are more significant than his website."
The American Government now provides the protection of their databases in respect of the test.
As a special representative, the Vize Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror measures, Russell Travers, shared the white house.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structure reforms" which have been required after the public reports by Wikileaks.
The white house also wants to check the way how the whole Government approves and protects information.
The American Government also suggested that the security of dissidents and actives should be concerned by the Wikileaks publication in danger.
"We have taken everything to contact them," said the Foreign Chamber Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
The East University
At the "Gelato University" in Bolóna, owners will be prepared for better years.
The three-day basis course for future Gelatiri has the greatest access and visitors of the world.
Where's the entire ice?
From the Gelatiers and from the Gelatium.
The legacy, in Germany, is anciently ancient of the own condictor, provides the crowd according to all rules of the Italian icemakers.
The Gelataio takes the icecreme out of the cocktail, stretchs it into the weapon and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola de Emilia in the Province of Bolóna.
But whoever more wants to know about Eis does not come to the "Glato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Eis University has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to justify the icecrema from its machines all the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basis course for future Gelatiri has the greatest access and visitors of all the world.
However, there are many day-day special cuts around school and practice in the household ice.
Some dreams in the middle-life crisis from a new carrier, others just driving on the glass of their fat seeds.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, artist teacher from California, loves Slow-Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a company officer and wants to get something own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream from opening a iceball in Kairo.
A man from Malta and one of the Brazilians want to improve the quality of the icecrema in their bars - and the Canadian household Julia comes because their children love Italian icecrema.
Maestro-Galletarian Luciano Ferrari explains the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect icecrema.
In fact, it is not only a good challenge, but also the sustainable conscience and the good conscience.
Luciano, however, does not forget the grounds of the national and mostly southern overbuilding: "Italian Galato is the best - and then there are still every lot of Romantics."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano buys the basic milk, shoes, shoes, shoes, sugar and stabilistors in a large mixer, which loads all over 85 degrees with an electronic program and then takes up to four degrees.
Then he turns a hair on the machine, and comes out a pasteurised white basecreme, based for all milk sorts.
The patient will immediately ask questions: Can you only produce Eiscreme with natural substances without stabilisator?
How can you let your own experience loss free run?
Luciano warns to lead himself from the timegeist to the wrong-doers.
Whoever talks about Eiscreme "only from natural states", possibly has used stabilisators - most of natural products, such as guard milk from the guardbone.
Of course, you can also make it without a stabilisator, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it's inside it, and the customer is a lower icecorn.
Some variations in the basic mass are allowed.
It's Spanisher with the aroma.
Maestro Luciano is distinguished in the east-department or in the supermarket smoking.
Moreover, there are pools and pasts.
"The leaders are all trying to adhere to you thousands of aromatic additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Or in fruits with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or in the eiscreme from the white basic mass, which will be made with eggs of yellow crome and with cacaopulver based on all possible shoko carriers.
Curses are now available to the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of Vanille, Schokolade, Mokka and Haselnuss - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanillearoma or other natural additives.
The same experience will also be submitted to the fruit sorts.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pipes - hardly it is not better.
Haselnus isn't smoking in terms of use if it contains more hairs.
The favorite Kiwi Eis provides the work group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilisator.
First a exhausted mixing has the smoke of a Gelato, says Luciano.
Easher production is a calculator: If Pfirsich is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar cancer must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For the citroneneis, a sucker extraport is required.
Luciano provides a device with which he determines the sugar content of fruit sorts (winzer measures the ochsle in the smooth).
Fortunately rewarding tables the resources.
It doesn't need to be so many body uses as before.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the fertilized ice mixing is struggled simultaneously and is cutting on minus temperatures.
All automatization to be able to keep small panels.
The Brazilian Gustavo shoots himself and his currency colleagues from above to below with fruits, when the superdimensional stabmixer will not be controlled.
"In each course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a question of time until something happens."
Controls in the light
The European Food Authority Efsa has been undertaken by the experimenting industry with plants.
This proposal now forms the expert group of testbiotech, which understands as an independent institution for the impact evaluation of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a disturbing theory, but we've made it good documents," said Testbiotech-head Christoph Then on midnight in München.
The leader of the Efsa Expert Group for genetically changed plans, Harry Kuiper, and another efsa experts have been also in the lobbyists-band Ilsi under the Treaty.
It is paid by concerts such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has efficiently cooperated with the efsa testing rules for plants, and it is criticized in a clear interest conflict.
The Efsa legislation shall be inappropriately equipped with the positions of the Ilsi documents, so that the manuscript of the industry should be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Party.
It's already the second time that the test biotechs cut an interest coalition.
So, if a higher efsa manager is at least without fixing or transitional time to Switzerland agricultural concerts Syngenta - and I have changed the pages.
In the same way, the Mediterranean Run function (MDR) has also established shortly personal connections between the EU Control Authority and Industriel Obby, which the environmental connection has made clearly as the EU Parlaments.
The efs cannot therefore recognize interest conflict.
It is a view to all serious data, as well as to those of the industry, while they are of high quality, it is in a opinion.
From the experts working for Efsa, don't ask them that they don't have contacts to the industry.
But you have to open these.
Kuiper enters his work for the International Life Science Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This seems to be a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy, including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby task.
In the case, non-dependent experts criticize such as that genetically changed plants will be allowed without any feeding tests in animals, and the reaction of plants to environmental flows will not be approved.
"We want to know, for example, what makes genetically changed but on the ground," says.
Current practice is, only isolated proteins, but not to test the entire plants which don't provide any exhaustive results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?", asked.
It also looks like Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientists are investigated since 1994 in the Gentech and are currently working on the Technical High School Zürich.
Industries try in this area as in the United States even more in Europe to influence critical scientists or discrimination.
That is why there is no need for researchers who do not flee with concerners.
For enterprises, critical studies would not be published regularly.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The rock of the stone
Uli Gsell also worried about about 400 kilos.
On Montgavend, he stood for Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's snipped.
The story is known: In September, the Baggers were attacked and began to interrupt a large piece of the north flow.
The Stuttgart World was not the same: twenty thousand demotors against S21, the billions of animals of the shore.
When it came to build, there was a large part of the flowers in dreams.
Breaked in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a weak green stone, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is an imagehouse in eastfilmers, 43 years old.
He's safe for a few of the broken.
"These stones are religious."
"You can't leave."
He suffers: "A poor and poor stone, simple and earthquake."
When he got a shot, he went to the cygaret.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the brokens.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The skin of Stuttgarter stone leads into a forest in Tübingen to a marriage munition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen created his rock-reich.
The 44-year-old age works with old stones.
He's buying everyone who's attracted at Abris in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame they would shoot up or go away in the deposit," he said in his office, a wood ball that was a stripper once.
He said that in September, he had buyed the rest of the north floor from the interruptor.
But he's talking to the S-21 guests, days.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything for Abris.
And if it happens once, it's the most understandable if the stones continue to be used.
At least 200 S-21 guests, one of the severe squares in the front of 80 kilos, with a piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As others, some are also in the hope of rebuilding him.
500 tons was buying Rongen, 25 big Lkw loads.
If the half remains in the forest, the rest has been sold longer.
Garden besetzer, landscape garden, housebauer.
Of all, they were coming and had been able to take the coffee room and additives.
The Stuttgarter stones of the steel have changed longer to the "mierle" or in limits of scarlets.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"It's not the political component."
He stands up in his cars, makes a tour through his 20 hectares' great kingdom.
Jura has studied and interrupted, later biology, then he has interested in computers and has finally become stone captives.
And Stein Liebhaber.
40000 tons of stone is built.
From all Germany, he's cutting his rate together.
He says he's the biggest of the Republic.
He's crazy.
In the snow, it's amazing sandstein.
"They were one time with the Dressner Marine Brücke," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's hungry.
"My lovelingsstein."
It's the high way through the forest.
He shows on a house: red Sandstein, previous part of the Carlsruher Bahnhofs.
And continue.
"Sweet Travant."
Once the squares were the tribs of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadions.
All in the snow stones and storys, Cannstatter traverses from the Stuttgarter Policeiprésion, roader granit from the Dom Sant Blasien, Tuff from Health Bronner hospital.
What kind of work, what damnness, what dead.
If the rounds think how the stones were cut off by hand and moved with simple flash and oxen carpets, he will be very respectful.
"It would be a skandal if you'd worry something like that."
The kingdom has not become, stone rich isn't anymore.
But 14 people are busy today, and they have left upstairs in the woods of stone, an image, a smile, a glass, and a garden building.
"We work hard, but it's satisfied," says the restverter.
At least he needs to go to the balls.
There is also stones to save.
High-Potentials struggle
It's a dominant ruler Andrang in the buffet.
16 Students were driving for lake, tomate supply and sweet.
The Technical University Braunschweig and the Autobauer people cars have invited the machine building and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they should learn together with VW developers about the car of the future of fatal implications - and very close to the people cars.
In the context of the most slightest heads, many companies are in the neighborhood fighting and set up, such as VW, to cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: The most income solvents may be able to recruit in the audiences before they come to the work market and be turned away from others.
And because the universities do not exhibit the designs of their students, they are trying to see the exception talents in practical projects and link themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car concerts run around the Talents.
A young dame from the person's department is distributed cycle letters, gumibberry and maps with VW-Logo.
She tells the hopeful young people of practical programmes and student jobs and shows them ways in the concerts.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig represents the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both pages: "The students are in contact with the industry and collect experiences."
"VW can learn students simultaneously, more interesting candidates are closer to and oversee who comes as workers in question."
Such cooperations, such as cell, are not in common.
The new is that the students will be used so openly.
"Last the heavy point was still on the simple project," says Shele.
The battle around the fresh graduates will be even worse.
In many branches, the companies can no longer choose their companies from a big shot of competitors.
In particular, they have to cut themselves up and especially to high-qualifised work forces.
In particular, solvents of the engineer disciplines are in a excellent treatment position.
According to the Verband of German VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained in October.
And the similar engineer smells will still be greater than the VDI prognoses.
For the Economic Review and Advisory Companies KMG Roman Dykta goes to the Talent Year.
He organizes remote recruiting events such as the KMG Race, a modern interface jagd in which the participants should find their way by GPS coordinates.
Eight multiple students want to send the company so in the next year or through the United States.
In addition, the participants can see the KPMG-Filials and learn the company.
He who can take place is decided in two selection borders in the field.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many competitors fly in the United States.
At home and steel around the high potentials at universities, the protection of Dykta will always be greater.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"It's just a simple sequence of sequence was too little."
It seems to get the account for the Talentian Dykta.
"We have a similar action with all participants until today."
"Anyone stand short before their conclusion and want to fight with us soon," he says.
Besides the direct bulls in the campus, mostly small and mediterranean companies are also classically at the employment measures.
"We're trying to achieve solvents on fashion."
"Atwa on the intersole," reported Sitha Stube, a personal teacher in the Solar Technical Management.
The bonner company works around 1500 workers in Germany.
Sustave knows about the survey problems.
It is currently mentioned on the website of the company 35 items.
"It's just very hard to put a vacant position."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the Union professionals.
Solar World cooperates with various high schools, even the university in Freeberg.
"The Professors give evidence that you can do practice with us or write his diplomatic work."
Teure Werbe actions are not indicated in the Solarspecialists.
For this, the company trys to move with other proposals to himself: personal atmospheres, flake hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't offer a big concert often," says the person's stress.
The money plays in the job search is not longer the main role.
Flexible work pages, children's integrity or good growth opportunities are more important factors.
Solarworld was 55 at a study of the Great Place to Working Institutes at the 55th place under the 100 best workers of Germany.
The Institute creates a yearly best list of German workers.
This is why the workers are satisfied with their work and their job field and looks on the framework conditions for the employees.
Personal staff is also expected by the location of more points in the workshop.
"I think the competitor looks especially after external evaluations about a potential employer," says.
Wolf Reiner Wars from the German employer Branding Academy to enterprises who want to build a good call as workers with a long-term strategy.
He brings his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to the war, in particular internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as employees, leads on their own workers," he says.
In the branchjagon, the internal employer Branding, so the training market education within its own employment.
"Proclaimed cooperators are the best news."
If you do well treat his people and identify them with the company, they would be all of them with friends and knowledge for their workers.
"This is like a game with band," says the wargler.
Obama stops new oil smoking
Before the continent of Florida in the golf of Mexico, there will be no new olive bodies in the future years.
An appropriate prohibition has made the Government in Washington, and to finally call for their previous plans.
Moreover before the Atlantic Castle, new reliefs are first investigated.
This shared the inner Ministry Ken Salazar on midnight.
The solvent for the strict prohibition to apply at least for the next five years is the explosion of the wood plattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disagreement, the 11 workers costed life and led to the largest environmental catastrophe of the United States, President Barack Obama had signed the pressure of the opposition and industry to allow new challenges in the east part of the golf of Mexico.
The officers want to reduce the dependency of the United States of oil payments from the outside.
He who takes the responsibility for the golf's golf is not finally concluded until today.
In the Centre of Critical, the British Energy Concerns BP is compared to billion requirements.
A Research Commission in Obamas shall introduce its results during December.
In October, Mr. Ken Salazar had raised the bourst of the explosion after the explosion.
In addition, various oil concerts have also submitted requests for new bottle plans.
With severe controls and severe security rules, Obama and Salazar will exclude a new catastrophe.
The competent Control Authority, which has been reformed in the case of several corruption proposals, is essentially reformed.
Parallel to this, Obama announced to close lucrative steel smokes for oil and gas concerts.
The industry is now publicly advertising that the golf-functions of the golf would be clearly less than before.
"The plans of the Government are the largest brems for the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current branch question by the BDO adviser - still before the bottom of Mediterranean.
The American Energy Alliance claimed the insecurity in the branch: "Nobody knows what is correctly changed with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be raised up to further - the latest of growth.
Ogoniland has been burned
The water in the flowers is oilbraun, it is like in the tanksite: billions of litres exhausted raw oil have destroyed the nature in Nigeria Ogonia.
Humans live by dibstone, corruption and illegal oil cock.
Celestine Akpobari means good.
"Don't put you away," the ecoactiveist urged the journalists, "You will be able to get enough oil slides before the linse."
The 37-year-year Nigerians have tried to declare one to the worst in the water, a boy who waited with the sliders of it: In the rainbow coloring water glass, the scene is nearly nice.
It's not to see that it's under the surface of brown roofwaters.
Earlierly she has gathered her here, Esther Badom reported on the top of the Bodo-Jetty flow.
In the middle of the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a born royal leader of raw oil in the rich field.
Fishers from the nearby cities Bodo must now run six hours to get in fishing waters: that in the heart of Nigerdelta, Ogoniland is applied as one of the worst covered regions of the world.
On the passengers traveled by rivers, the entire extent of the exploitation will be dependent on.
Instead of full water, the motor boat seems a brown brown brown, who put his hand into the water, gets a white finger out.
The roots of the mangrim trees are like black lacristic stages from the ground, let the palms withdraw their weight.
The birdwaters, as they are usually in fields of fever, are looking for forgiveness: When the outer border is weak, are broken in that as a tangkest stretching former paradise special relax.
"What happens here is environmental war leading," says Celestine Akpobari window, "We live in permanent danger for health."
The war comparison is taken.
The location area of Ogoni is a fighting field for decades: here is the first exploitation of Europe for more than 60 years ago, which was organised here in the 80-year-old, with the first exploited manufacturer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, the Shell concerts 1993 needed to set her production because it was dangerous for its olive workers.
Today, the company rejects the return to Ogoniland: While the three-game size of the Switzerland with more than 5000 wood sources and 700 miles of road leaders each day, more than two million fases of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, to instabilly the concert is the situation.
All hundreds of meters are raised up steel materials like strange sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the bowls too seriously.
You are up to 50 years old, most of them are corrected in the market.
Always break a row head once again, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of roh oil in the water.
More than two billion liters are flowed after expert estimations in 50 years in the Delta ecosystem: Year per year the quantity of oil, as they are at the supertanker's Hawaii "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska, one of the most environmental catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the Eco-GAU continuing, will be shut up on it.
While the shell concert sabotage and the organised olive steel is responsible for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmental protectors required bottles and low pipelines as main causers.
Shell, in Nigeria, lower security standards, usually in the world, the US scientists Richard Steiner predicted the concert 2008: Only the Council of Defects on the guides is "in a multiple higher than otherwhere".
In a place that seems like a delicious, dead work place under free sky, looks out of the mangrid structures: They are slipped and slaughtered to the hair.
Under one of the many chariots that are part of the roads are likely to be spreading on the ground, flackers a fire: an illegal small raffinery.
In the fass, the roof oil will be smoked over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the benzine goes through the rore in the top, later rolls on the end of the cherocine and finally out of this.
This produces Michael and four workers each day to four chairs Diel to 300 liter: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the cronical carbon pressure in the largest earthquake country of Black Africa.
Nigeria is only available on a single raffineries.
The bottom of 40 euro center per liter low price can still submit the illegal cookers: because their raw substance is obvious.
He is from "Bunkerners", who wanted to steal the pipelinets by Ogoniland: In this way it goes to the country by experts in the whole Nigerdelta every day to lose at least 16 million liter rohöl.
However, only a losing small part of the provisional interlated raw substance is illegal: the leavenantil fills organized criminal networks, which also should be political and high military, in tank ships and destroys it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental catastrophe has been caused by the operations of the population or the lax production, the activist Acpobari is for pure academic.
"If the oil companies were not considered to be incoming and had not destroyed the lives of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no debstail, or illegal raffineries."
In the meantime, the relationship of the Ogoni, in particular, to Shell, destroys that only one movement of the concerns comes wrong: "That may be other nationalities like the Chinese as better."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The highest time you're lost," says the muscle oilman.
"Any minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil sudden from the special unit of the battle forces, there is no detention, but a painful painful payment.
In particular, the soldiers who are in the Government will also want to benefit from the Nigerians.
"This fucking saug has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
Detecting dangerous building errors in A380 drivers
The A380 has a great problem of security.
The explorers have detected a possible build error in the investigation of an unlawed machine that could lead to a "catastropated triebwork evacuation".
Fluglinie Qantas will now deal with the engine manufacturer.
The Passagiers of the unlawed Qantas Airbus Airbus in the beginning of November have obviously known much more happy than long: the Australian Air Security Authority has set a large problem in the travel works of some A380 machines - and now warns for a possible build error.
The potential defect had severe consequences: In an oil smoking connection, he could create railways and lakes, it had been published in one opinion published in this Sunday by the ATSB Authority.
This could lead to "a katastrophale trial accident".
It is involved by Rolls-Royce travel equipment in 20 A380 lines.
The Qantas Airbus, which had to be noticed on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian air community has now introduced legal steps against the British Turbin producer.
It provides an advice to a Australian Budget Court in Sydney that allows him further legal actions against the company.
Qantas-hof Alan Joyce said that his airport company will require suffering for the event beginning of November.
In the brain of the engine, the parts were solved and the tracks were wounded.
Rolls-Royce made an oil burn as a cause for the wounds.
After the interval, it must now be replaced to 40 trainworks worldwide.
Australian experts suggested to carry out further safety tests to the Superjumbos which were issued with the involved trainworks.
The security recommendation was the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said the ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem has been maintained sufficiently important to inform all concerns.
After the Qantas machine disappearance, the airport company had maintained its A380 flows for weeks on the ground.
Singapour Airlines left about three of his 11 A380 over the ground.
The aircraft changed the driver in A380 as a pre-advertising measure.
The double flower is the biggest passive airport of the world.

On several car cars and many streets, the transport is strongly limited.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was long, but it was not completed with the continuous raining snow.
Moreover, there were pitched woods over the East Sea.
The contract for the sea ship and hydrography (BSH) waits on the Eastern Sea Shellwig-Holstein from the former day at storm flows with 1,2 meters over the normal state.
In Sachsen, the snow reliefs on the car cars and travelways brought to serious problems.
According to the investment center meteomedia, the highest level was identified in the Switzerland, therefore, the alarm level was violated - the highest level.
Partly, there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds were worried for reliefs.
There they stayed in the night for several lakes and cars.
The police authorities also in Sachsen-Containment reported a great depression on the streets.

Snows on the likes, turned trees on the shadows or destroyed overlies and snows are the main problems.
In Sachsen, the teletransport was to be installed from Leipzig to Nürnberg.
In the Thiring Saalfield, a ICE had to stop his travel.
The 165 passengers were offered by firewaters and savings with wild decks, food and dress in the ship.

German Bank looks for a buyer for their targets
The German Bank wants to be separated from their real signs: According to a journal report, the money house for both officers are looking for the officers at their Frankfurter main seat.
Before 500 million euros, the immobility could be introduced.
In addition, the German Bank has made its concern sitting nicely: the wheels in Frankfurter's bank quarters are modernized, and the bankers have continued to return to their old employment.
However, now the Financial Times wants to reach the costs of renewing, and look for a buyer for both homes, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on a speaker.
No reasons for the planned venture called the speaker.
"We'll always check if it's easier to possess immobilities itself or to sell and then leave," he said.
The largest credit institution of Germany has already been rejected after a short time.
The Bank took the duplicates in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the employers of a household fund and then healed.
The energy rebuilding spread the data for about 200 million euros.
A sale of the bank would have a lot of money.
Branchen experts estimate the value of the enterprise named in Greentowers after about 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are redirected to a fund in the field of the bank, or to a independent investors, are still open, said the speaker.
Three thousands to all boards
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the robbed mountains that were explained after several explosions in a mines for death.
The body could not still be hidden because the security position in the disaster is still predominant.
Two weeks ago, it came to a huge explosion in the Pike River Mine near the Greymouth city.
29 mountain workers in the age between 17 and 62 were slaughtered in days.
A sonde was left in the disagreement box, but there was no shirt of survivors.
Since the high concentration of gas gas and further explosions were not able to increase saving forces from safety rates.
After the second height detonation, the authorities and experts had gone out that there was no survival opportunity for the companion.
The body could not be hidden.
Now, the relatives and friends remembered the dead.
Ten thousand people were gathered in Greymouth in the New Zealand South Island.
Two minutes they smoke.
In the honour of the caught mountains, 29 tables were established to see helms, lamps and the names of the couple.
Also images and personal natures, including clothes and surfbretters, found their place here.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-max.
The New Zealand hoped that the mountains would come back to the surface, the New Zealand President John Key said to the participants of the Mediterranean.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't end with his son's death until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was slain in the group.
Besides the President of the victims and the victims, several outland diplomas participated in the Mediterranean Federation.
At the first explosion on 19 November, Bergleute was also protected by British and South African origin.
Return workers began to eliminate a fire inside the coalbergwork in the South New Zealand.
When the explosive gas is disappeared, it will be started that the fulfillment of temperatures in the mines, the President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Shit, warner!
Is it the splater to the artskino?
The Register Nicolas Winding Refn plays with his fighter epost "Walhalla Rising" old Genre green.
In what public may the Danish Register Nicolas Winding Refn think when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner of Vikinger war with only one eye (Mads Mikelsen) is free from his peninsulas and steals with nearly overmanical forces with his hair - sounds ideal for young men's visitors in searching for bloody action, just because our held likes rabbit's death methods and his enemies already reaches the threats of the living body, if he has a worried launch.
On the other hand, Oneauge says how he is actually called, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures can be raised up to one or two aspects or a few qualified death crying.
Furthermore, it is grown and grown in the amazing beauty of Scotland, which provides the culs for thousands of years ago.
Ideal more for adult cineases with interest for existialism and very quiet camera travellers.
It's good if a movie has several target groups, it's sick only if they're excluded.
Regisher Winding Refn applies since his wilderness and drogendealer trilogy "Pusher" as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to make his works with more humor to the Mainstream or something less brutality to the arthouse.
Most of the artkino friends could be scared from the stealing brain mass and the darms.
The Action Funds die after the long-term time when an enemy of free interpretable reasons with a military Christian missionary traveled through the ship to Jerusalem and set an eternity in flaute and Nebel before the humanity arrives openly in America and there continues to suffer.
There is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has found no kino train and is now appeared on the DVD.
This is particularly because of the precious images, but even because it's behind the presences to blood fases, a pitch of Kino, which has reached something of attention.
In this movie, it doesn't matter dialogue or a stringing action, it's all atmosphere, a film-order fiber room.
And there's no intrins for the supervisor.
Refn enjoys him a moment of disappointment and smooths him with his nice images and the dark track of trace of trace, especially with the unfair hass, who cut him out of the heart of the figs.
Only a small blonde boy who is faithful on the side, keeps himself as an unschuld, all others will be carried out of anger.
In most of the unfortunate held that the motive will never be declared, but for enemies and for the past lies will be to the warner of the hell, possibly to the messager of the devil himself.
He means loss, but maybe only for those without destruction.
"Walhalla Rising" is a famous film that you can hate and wonder, for the threat, the story and the stations.
A resurrect.
Racial treatment
The IAEA Atom Energy Authority has new indications to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country turns to take place -- let it still control.
At the Northern Night of 5 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 aircrafts were achieved a mysterious, building building in Syria.
It is on the river of Euphrat; the next greatest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-saur.
Your name is covered in documents of the International Atom Energy Authority (IAEA) when it goes to the reactor, which Syrian has built with the help of North Korea in the Cuder, hidden in a town that goes out of the stream.
According to a letter of the U.S. Secret Service of the CIA from the end of April 2008, the name of the neighborhood residence El-Kibar reactor was well appropriate to create Plutonium - from which atomwater was built.
For other purposes, the technology does not beyond the fifty-fifty.
The CIA led a video presentation with uncharpen satellite images.
Per computer animation, they struggled where the components of the reactor should be before destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atom Center.
She also proposed photos showing the building from the nearby or to the internal room.
The reactor was short before the industry, but it wasn't yet watched with burning.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, it is nearly known than that time, and the rates were greater with the time.
The previous US President George W. Bush concluded in his memory that the CIA was sure that Syria in el Kibar was built a reactor, but it wasn't enough to see that there was a "a active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some secret services in Europe are more careful and speak only of a "acceptable reactor", even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plasibable".
You miss hard evidence, like the IAEA.
Asks how sure he is to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diploma in the room just a lapidar who has "a good material to ask questions".
The Protection of the "intrusted military buildings" of the Syrians made vacation and planned the planning.
However, in June 2008, a IAEA team found under the former Chefinspector Olli Heinonen in the el-Kibar Spins of Uran, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA has received a Member State of satellite pictures of trade providers from the time directly after the attack that can be expenditured than the CIA representatives.
However, these receptions are not to be achieved on the market because the unknown employer - maybe Israel - she has sold exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its reality independently.
Syria has always demonstrated that a secret atom program has been conducted or built a reactor.
The Uran is from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
However, the IAEA's analysis of the party is likely to return.
Seither refuses Damaskus to discuss - just like the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers refuse a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the tremblings of the broken building.
But the Israelites also suffer.
"We'll never comment it," strengthened at the time of the attack of Premier Ehud Olmert, the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unreceived since June 2008 and "developed to a serious credibility problem for the Authority" as a high-west diplomat in Vienna - finally a serious disappearance against the Atom Arms Treaty in the room on which the IAEA expects.
As a key to progress in the statement, the IAEA is clearly seeing three other equipment that should be "in functional connection" with the necessary reactor - and other than this.
The inspectors have no longer been opened to which structures it is, or what function they have or what they have to appear independently.
After information of the South-East Journal, they will be referred to in the IAEA Internal as Marj as-sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, reiterated from nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and made a construction complex on satellite images in Masyaf, where it is probably along with one of the sustainable objects.
It may be in or immediately close to a military support point - exactly with this conclude, the Syrians of the IAEA reject access to the three areas.
In Vienna, the Syrians were afraid of a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be submitted from the United States to evacuate military railways.
Because the nuclear technology were noted by an indication of the US Secret Services on the institutions.
The IAEA indicated, including satellite photos, that between the three areas and the square in the Euphrate Material has been transported and transported.
A highest west diploma in Vienna said, at least one of the annexes could be "in relation to the fire production".
However, "no indications on sensitive activities", such as uranian reinforcement or renewing; processes needed to build atoms.
The reactor type will be carried out with Uran that is not available.
However, where the Uran should come and where the plutonium should be declined later for the bomb, there are some plausible suspects to these central issues.
Unknown is also whether dreams, which may be worthwhile springs, have been loaded in three places.
As the hundreds of lake loads lost from the earth, no one will have any information about where the protection is left.
The only few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat Salzmina al-Tibni, which has investigated the Syrian 1998 at its owning as a laser for radioactive mull, is likely to be applied to the IAEA.
The previous IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had recently in an analysis of satellite images for the renamed Magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
However, records from the Orbit show that Syria has taken landworks on the three dealing places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a case, but it is not avoided to cut off the disaster.
Moreover, the IAEA has used some months to develop a plan for inspections where the Syrian should allow some military secrets - only shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
In addition, Damaskus also rejected this proposal.
Had western diplomates in Vienna yet a year ago, the reactor has already destroyed, therefore the thing has not been highly driving, brings some US-Botschafters Glyn Davies a few months ago, such special inspections in the game, one of the worst means that the Vienna Atom Authority has to transform controls.
IAEA-head Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "the option for which I am open in the future", but he still rejoices.
There is a high risk in this way: for one needs a majority in the Government Council of the IAEA, and some of 35 countries there are all other than a scale.
To others, how a diplomat is thinking, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started in the sommer with the work at her still unnamed region office, there is worse.
The trial book has written herself, a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but it's enough for a disgust.
Shortly the famousness, the woman, a Muslim, is lost during the Jugoslawian War in her Serbian Advocator.
Bosnian women's companies have immediately protested, at least some planned Drehage in Sarajevo were submitted shortly to Hungary.
In the middle of the film in Hungary and in the post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the United Nations Flight Support of the UNHCR in Jolie and requested a meeting with the shoes, reported a bosnical journal now - Jolie himself is a newspaper of the United Nations flying assistance work.
She is not diplomatic - she has invited women a meeting in Hungary for weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be located in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love story in the shipping camps has not given it, and Jolies holding the victims against it is enough over the trial book.
Your organization recommended the UN flight assistance work to leave Jolie as a messager, reported by the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie wrote for scenes?
The Bosnical Culture Ministry, which has received reading her trigger book, has provided a driving authorisation for Sarajevo - it is not very clear why Jolie did not even come.
The young officer himself shows that it does not follow political views with its film, has been increasingly involved in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a vote to all participated pages.
However, in the contents she remains vague.
So a second synopsis to the film in the network, which sounds very different: the loved ones knew before war explosion and meet again as she, a bosnical muslim, will be thrown into a Serbian camp where he works as a watch.
It sounds very different than the variable "the victims of the prosecution are connected in the flattern's bondage."
That Jolies movie really begins before the war - it's so sure.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on false information."
Now you can only make the hacker of Hollywood Peace: using the trial book, as many before, is illegal in the network.
Nothing like this.
On this evening, it's finally running right around for the Irelands.
There's no smoke of damnness.
For this, the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans smoke for joy in a cracking smooth music, they shoot with the feet.
The bailey pub lives in the southern cork, because the player's tishing camps over a 3-meter distance in Bierbecher - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the strange spectacle, which is winning 500 euros and airports to Las Vegas for the Bierpong worlds in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drink game and the back-up computer that doesn't really match.
However, the 26-year-old-year-old is trying to take care of the question which will be taken to the future.
At his plan does not have a game path in Las Vegas, he will lead in the January Conference in New Zealand.
"I have a lot of feeling there," he said.
"It's so far from home and I have no job there."
Always: his girlfriend waits for him in Auckland - " she had rucked to take her desire as a event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and laughed.
Through the bad perspectives home, two of Tanners have already seen their happiness in the outside.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as IT-Bereter in London.
The boys go: How the Tanners looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irelands will even leave the country at the next time, say experts of the ESRI Economic and Social Research institution in Dublin.
At 2015, they are even calculated with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country, only 4,5 million inhabitants are a heavy loss.
Conservation of the prognoses is comparable to those under Ireland in the eighth years.
After a decade of the surrounding that brought great goodness to the Irelands, the tristese is now relarged.
The Economic Crisis, especially the young, well-produced industries, for which it was just mounted up.
The loss of work and social disappearance appeared absurd in the boom-years.
Everyone was needed, the money was in overflowing.
However, there are three of ten women and men among three without work.
In the Irish Times, there are readers of young aliens who claim: "All in Ireland go back to the boat."
"It should be a surprise against politicians and bankers - but whoever can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last makes the light."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future because the Government is only eyewide and the young people have no future views.
"There are reducing the minimum, but they have no strategie to create new workplaces," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how their commillions get themselves from a non-paged practice to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says that it is necessary to get out in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressive."
So try to put up men like Stephen McLarnon the subject positive.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a measure that offers a round service to the subject of work in the foreign.
"For employees, the work in the foreign country is a great chance to make the first steps on the carrier leader," says the manager.
On his website, photos of Surfer in Australia and Snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working in the foreign is not a gallery service, but also bring freedom and happiness.
As it feels to build somewhere, Sean O'Donovan knows a half year.
Because it was nothing more to do for the 29-year-year engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction of Germany.
They're just getting a modem house.
In January, it continues to go to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
His home is seeing O'Donovan in the middle of the middle, because he makes extra skills to pay the credit for his house home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, when he walks first on his house's wheel.
"I pay money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm so good as never."
He's lying and walking through exciting rooms.
The small house is in a famous holiday with pregnancies, in the investors parks great, pure cars.
Joint with one sister O'Donovan buyed the house for 4 years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 per cent credit funded.
"They were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he said.
Did he fear that it could go with the credit?
O'Donovan takes a time, gets a tea, and says, "I have no children I have to travel and I'm young; even if everything goes, I can start with the new."
The building engineer doesn't like the weakness that he hears often.
"Nobody has to hunger - our situation is not so dramatic as in the past times here," he says.
"A while working in the foreign, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel so first than Ireen."
He laughs and then tells his father who has gone in the last great economic crisis to England.
"After seven years he was back there and the life continued to Ireland, very easy."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just see how it runs with the lives.
A few years of work in London has already been behind him, and why should it not work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
However, there is still one thing that involves him in these days: the fever at his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's scared that it could go out in a party of life.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says and drinks a big shot of his beer.
"It seems serious."
"We love to call it a journey party, a locker, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is stronger as the support of private enterprises.
Criminality is a greater problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than the United States.
For these results, the latinobarometer insurance was published in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist.
This review will be conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's question from September and October, especially in the eye.
First the good vote in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries in South America's Southern Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased (see Table 1).
In Peru, where the economy increased 6% since 2002, the number of democracy officers increased 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has reached from the strong income in the last year, it is to recognize such treatment.
However, only half of the questions in Mexico and Brazil, the most popular countries of the region, are convinced to democracies, which are focused on the regional average (see diagram 2).
Ca. 44% of the questions explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which are so many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
At least 34% the Congress of their country, and 45% of their government, both values correspond to them in the last year, but show a clear increase in 2003 (17% or 24%).
For a decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis is the efforts for more democracy.
This is also in the period of global economic crisis, that the Latin American countries have lived only a short reception phase and have reached them quickly.
Moreover, the poors have received a stronger social network.
(For reports of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this week, 2009, the poverty ratio in Latin America has increased only less than 32% in this year.)
However, there are strong differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazilian strong economy and the liberty of the distinguished President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a wide progress.
In Mexico and the Middle America, where the reception was stronger and has taken violence crimes, this is less than the case.
First of the second time since the question begins, many in Latin America in the crime in their country see a greater problem than in worklessness (see diagram 5).
Ca. 31% says that their own or a family member in the last year of a crime, however, about 38% in the last year, the values are cut down and are therefore achieved by the latter position since 1995.
The increased economic leadership is reflected in the stronger support of private and market economy against: at least 71% of the demands have been exceeded regionally that the private economy for development was increasingly 56% in 2007 (see Diagram 6).
Ca. 58% stated that only the market economy can proceed to its country, compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the questionnaires in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President Hugo Chavez, many privacy companies.
Brazil has 19% of the questions (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unmodified since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared 11% in the last year).
The questions in Mexico and most of the Middle America have seen the most influenced country in the United States, where this role will be taken in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
A choice slide
Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts have overcome the fears of the electoral who were able to help the country.
Overful choices, multiple votes, choices in Rinnstein, destroyed Wahllocals and surprises were only part of the problems.
Wahllocale opened with an hour-term storage.
Many Haitians, from which many were homeless by the earthquake in January, traveled around the search of a choice.
Some were finally entirely opened.
A thousands of presidential candidates, including some mutual spitzing leaders, were required to replace the results of the choices.
In the entire country, there was too much violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, the choice "as well in many interests."
According to a precious explanation of observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "the facts of these irregularities, so they may also be serious that the process does not necessarily incorrectly".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election Authority, which is committed to the unlimited President René Preval and his candidate, Jude Celestein, will be published on 7 December.
The expected ticket selection is recommended for January.
There's another hope in the choice.
The two leaders of opposition canadians, the Rap musician Michel Martelly and the former Lady Mirlande Manigat have returned their initial invalidity plan.
If Jude Celestein, who only finds no agreement with the electorers, explains the electoral authority to the sticker of the election, could this lead to problems.
Because of the Cholera Epidemia and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in cells, a small choice participation has been feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prohibited by missing organization in the Stimmab.
Currently before the election was about about 250,000 indications required for the choice still not separated.
It's a lot in the game.
The country's country consider a legitimate, recognized government as a important step in rebuilding Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after your husband died, the President of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, a weight of sympathies, which runs 20 points to over 50%, and this is the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, if you will help this in the next year to a recovery election, you describe whether the appearance of the severe Cristina Fernández is more compromissary than her dead husband, its properties and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs for that are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also raised the economic policy after the election of his wife, often established budget plans that have not been fully concerned with the taxes, the economic growth and the inflation.
This allowed the President's Party to express extra measures according to its own goods.
On the paper, the Fernandez Government has lost most of the congress in the last year.
However, the opposition is divided and the church's death after a heartfarm on 27 October led to further surveys.
Some regionary critics from the rivers of the rural medians were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (with which a parliamentary struck another in the face and others applied to the Government of the Prohibition), the Congress did not agree to the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss it," the President.
The budget 2010 is now applied to the next year where the President has more opportunity to pay money on its own goods.
The economy is heavy: it is probably growing up to 9% in this year.
The official inflation ratio is, for example, at 11,1%, but many private assessments - and lowest requirements of businesses - takes the value to at least 30%.
Kirchner, who took the Office as a protected Argentina of economic crisis, declared the growth and army to its main objectives, and not the inflation inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scanning the private sector and submitting the National Institute for Statistics and People's Account INDEC, which would like the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández income a faster way now?
She called the private economy and the society leaders to talk.
And according to official expenditures, the rate increases should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina agricultural products have given the economy a strong exploitation.
However, the inflation has submitted the growth ship by a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández wants for this reason that Argentina will reach the rest of the world.
In the beginning of this year, the Government found a agreement with a value-papier officer, which had rejected the previous conversion of the country in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to take a agreement with the soldiers from the Paris Club which she's charged for $6,7 million.
The churchs had a check through the IMF, as usually other places, always refused.
However, in the last month, the Economic Ministry Amado Boudou knew that the fund would be led to the creation of a new national consumer price index "technical support" and it seems that it would be the first step to reduce INDEC.
It is not known that Fernandez will also be politically active on the end of their office time without support by his husband.
If so, it needs the support of the medium ship that the largest part of the church is enough.
If the Argentine returns from her sommer smoking in March, the weight of the symptom that you have been denied will be exceeded.
If she wants to win another choice, she must decide whether she takes many political decisions with her husband quietly.
Slow applaus for China
Taiwan's choicers are closer to a closer connection to the Festival country.
What does Taiwan take from his great brother on the side of the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7,5 million Wheellers, which are 70% of all election officers to choose in the five citizen citizens and citizens, and this will be a wide evaluation of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
By the establishment of bathless business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol for relations to the Festival country. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma has made the test, but it's just a button.
Although its Kuomintang-Partie (KMT) sets three of the five citizens, she has no vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPPP), which ensures a larger independence of Taiwan, receives almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
This would be important for Ma's problems in a presidential election.
Since his election was two years ago, the voting of his party has fallen about about 8%.
Firstly, the DPP also entered the KMT to the town area.
During the election, it came to the normal preventions in Taiwan, such as the lavage convention with cravail guests, flag-smoking massage, and only striking dances.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious killing.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the Holy President of the KMT, held a talk on a KMT candidate,
When a man shocked him in his face, lion was disappointed and killed a surrounding survey.
Wizard is not clear if the protected lines wanted to kill or train a fight with the candidate.
Independently, the advice says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election, and the DPP pressed in a bad light, which the KMT has protected more voices.
Maybe China was the greatest winter of the campaign.
Note that the relations to the festival have not been subjected.
Instead, the candidates discussed the plans of social apartments and the design of workplaces.
The Taiwanians love their real independentness and disappointment of China's military disorders.
For this reason, the CMT does not like its relations to the Government in Beijing in the foreground.
However, this time, the DPP also disturbs the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She reacted to the new conscience that Taiwan's economy can't survive without China.
However, he wants to ensure that most of the Taiwanians support their Chinese policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to follow its strategy to lock Taiwan with economic advantages in the Community.
China sent an employee to Taipeh in order to prepare an investment security and medical cooperation.
It must also want a political integration, but the most important.
It is expected to be expected until the President's elections 2012.
The DPP has reached.
Two years ago, she was strong worried: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat because of corruption in prison.
During his presidentship from 2000 to 2008, he was excited to the absolute independentness.
However, under Tais Government, a new generation of employed politicians and the DPP fights for the votes of employees and young people.
Tsai found a great agreement for the President candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party now makes everything to show that she is also in the ability to build any relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans a ideal point of contact between the DPP and China, however, the prejudice of free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offered a "trusted alternative" to mass preliminary accommodation in China.
Chen seems very painful about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the candidates of the DPP would be better to be independence on Taiwan.
He also requested the Pragmatic Su to face the president's candidate.
The DPP is also hard to choose their potential candidates.
The KMT must be subjected to a self-analyse.
But the values are bad, but the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their choice fight without him.
The main foundations for his unfaithfulness seem to be unemployment and to be always more threats between the arm and the kingdom.
According to the exhibition of a KMT speaker, he will convert his cabinet and the local institutions.
The strengthened approaches of the DPP may notify that Taiwan is only limited to reaching.
In the same time, most Taiwans see the economic cooperation with China as increasingly.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "Don't give it any more back."
Grammy names: The Jazz-Songerin Esperanza Spalding was surprised in the Newcomer category of the year
If you go on the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself bat Esperanza Spalding, to achieve the nobel price in 2009. Now, the 26-year-old Jazz Bassistin and Cancer's Cancer has been nominated overseas for this year Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding since its album "Esperanza" 2008 is already a famous star in the Jazz scene, the name appears to be a little amazing. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, after which a artist has been published before the publication of the album, with which he was known in the wide publicity, it may be made at least three albums.
Your honourable album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is sure a step before. And with its excited voice and a good conversation for Pop, Funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as Jazz-interpretin in this category of name Spaldings.
Moreover, the Vijay Iyer Trios's "Historicity" album was named in the Category of Instrumental Alben. This love of the critics has been raised by a success.
The concurrent Iyers include the "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a famous favorite from New Orleans and a frequency gate in HBOs "Treme", was designed in the Category Zeitgenesis Jazz, in the other areas of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret society of the wild Steampunk music Darcy James Argue has received a great group of attention in the Category Great Group. He is therefore faced against the Billy Childs Emsam with his room jazz and the avoidable Dave Holland and his okted, his life-abblem "Pathways" is a good example for a baseist as a demokratic band leader.

Moschee in Temecula wins the agreement of the Planning Committee
The construction of a moschee in Temecula found after a five-year-old, sometimes public hearing was the unique approach of the local planning committee.
Criticals proposed the project to promote terrorism as well as transport.
However, according to a comment of the Commission from Middle-nest night, the new religion center corresponds to the local provisions and will be an ethical view.
"This project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," explained Hay Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley tomorrow.
"All Americans do me honor."
"It shows that righteousness is ruling."
"It's just a little genius," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"It's a wonderful people in this Talk."
The meeting started at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the Centre were at least north, both the votes were distributed on both sides according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate was further carried out on the website of the journal.
"No more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of the birds, and the freedom state is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic Centres also have brought protests in other parts of the country, for example, near Ground Zero, the location of the terrorism at the city of New York on 11 September 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called in violence.
His community with ca. 135 families lives peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted to be a larger and better place than the ship that they had met together with a manufacturer for water filters.
The new, about 2.300 m2 big moschee in the middle border style must have two minarettes and about 13m high.
It should be located at about 17.500 m2 large baskets at Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Gegners can still attach to the town Council avoid the project.
Arsen-resistent mikrobe could allow new life forms on earth or otherwhere
The detection of a strange type of bakterie that can live by axes, opens new opportunities for new life forms on earth and otherwise.
Although scientists discovered this increasing bakterium here on earth, it is their view for a sign that life is also possible without the elements that have been developed before.
"This organism has two opportunities."
"He needs growing or phosphor or arsen."
Paul C.W. Davies from the Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report, which appears on the Sunday of the Science's magazine on Sunday.
Before six main elements were considered as living required - cool substance, water, steel substance, smoke, phosphor and smooth.
However, as the scientists found, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake also increases when it replaces Fhosphor by Arsen.
"But you ask what else it is possible," said the Co-auteur of the report Ariel D. Anbar from the Arizona State University.
The detection is a important step in searching for external life, since scientists need to recognize the life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study seems to be considered with microbs found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which there were no detailed detail for detection has been made a long-term speculation in the Internet that the report could be conducted by the detection of external life.
This isn't the case.
The detection "declares that in other planet systems organisms with other components of biochemical processes can be able to gain and that the standard elements, which are absolutely required, are not constantly defined", says Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Science Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a note, because she shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures a element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of the high arsen content.
Since the arts and phosphor are similar to chemically, they took that microbs that both are equipped may be replaced by the other.
"The gravity of the assessment is in particular that it is chemically similar to the phosphor."
"Therefore the organizations are difficult to distinguish a element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that the arsen works different than the phosphor. It is achieved in our biochemical system where it almost all is broken," says Anbar.
The researchers set up the GFAJ-1 bacterium a higher concentration of the arts and growth.
The microbi grows better in Phosphor, but it also can survive in the arsen, shows that a arsen-based form of life can be made naturally, or on earth or on another planet or month, often comes on the arsen.
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that Phosphor can be replaced by Arsen, not new, but before there was no functioning example.
Arsen came in the past years often, saying, the science has gone out of it that the previous forms of life have been used.
"This is a reason for accepting that life can also have developed differently than in the previous earthly age," so Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research works were supported by the NASA, the Energy Ministry and the national health authorities.
Other locked exhibitions found in Compton
The rest of two of the four exhibitions locked before a ballflower mobile were found according to the exhibition of Los Angeles County Sheriffs from the Sunday.
The four exhibitions - two acitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Sunday, as unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals were undertaken before a bellflower motel 6 nights, so the authorities's reports.
Two of the dogs were discovered at midnight, and the last two on the midnight, stated Steve Whitmore, a speaker of Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
"The good news is, the dogs are good," so Whitmore.
"They're in good state."
"They have been returned to their legal possessions."
Whitmore didn't make exact information on the foundation of the dog or the circumstances that have led to their detection.
"The medicines are still running."
"We don't want to say that," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some springs."
The dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Sunday for events.
They took their two dogs at midnight in a Downey's house in Downey.
The representatives of the sheriff found the cars and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Acitas - Trace, a 3-year-year-old route, and Didi, a 10-year-old Hengdin - were unexpected by the Authority Committee.
However, Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted this week in the job of their Japanese inhabitants on the concurrence, stayed disappeared until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were at the end of this week because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek the Times reported on the Mediterranean, the other dogs should share in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba-Show.
South-California is a stop at the nearly one monthly tour of the Paris from dogs view to dogs.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard were checked in the mobile.
They often overcome in Motels and parking their cars before their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer floor, a parson Russell Terrier and a British - with her mobile room.
The dickfeld Akitas and Corgis stayed in the car, because it was cutting there.
They left the window a split wide, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard sent their cars on Sunday at 6:00 as locked.
Peek promises everyone who can give a indication to the Corgis a finder lone. The animals were planted for identifying.
On Sunday, it was not yet determined if a finder payment was paid.
The lion shall be cut down after the judicial authorisation of the MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulencies and insecurities, MGM has finally received green light for a new beginning.
A New York competitor welcomed the "preparing" plan on the Sunday, to attach the faults of $5 billion and to the 86-year-year-old conversation companies to build the way for new films and television.
According to the conclusions of the Sunday, the Plan fulfils the requirements of the US competitive law, so that the restart of MGM under the guide of Gary Barber and Roger Birnboum, the citizens of Spiglass Entertainment, will be fulfilled in the way. Barber and Birnboum will be presented to something aspected as a major employer.
The number of cooperators is added by over 400 to 320.
For MGM Chapter 11, it is actually only in force when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned rate of $500 million to finance new MGM products.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank that has $75 million, the company, and the financing must be held to the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studio started in May 2009 with the task to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company who had been fighting with payments of $300 million/year to help their financial problems.
In August, the employer Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ancient CEO in Enron and restructuring expert, which was known by his activities in Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial MGMs and to pay more than 140 creditors of the study were longer than expected.
After monthly discussions, the parties decided to offer the company to buy.
However, the auction was just a few beers, and no one wanted to pay $2 billion of the faithful.
In the early year, the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was signed after monthly debates and internal warnings finally under October.
When MGM has overcome the competition officially in the next week, Moelis and Cooper have received a bonus in high of several million dollars.
The share of Moelis & Co. which have already received $1,2 million is $9,5 million.
Cooper, which was paid for the leadership of the company monthly 375,000 dollars, has received a "Erythbonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnboom planning to take the production in MGM again. In this year, the studio was only a film and created a year plan with seven or eight films that should come to the kinos in the beginning of 2012.
Moreover, they plan two films after "The little Hobbit" in Co production with Warner Bros.
The study needs a separate difference between $265 million to $275 million for its financial share in these two films that should be located under the region of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed the 18% of the MGM Dalehens, tried to fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, who is the greatest actionary.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies have not resulted.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in equal weight
This year's favorite under the gifts is the iPad, probably followed by a Microsoft Kinect videoconsole. Both game areas can travel a significant lot in your gift budget.
A iPad costs like five BMX routes for $99, while the price for a kinect game is about 10 classic springs or ca. 48 Dozen Play-Doh.
But you can offer your gift budget.
Before soon, I visited the search for three electronic players in $80 three national game handlers - a Wal mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I was immediately clear that Moores's law was in force. This year's technological games are able to lead and cost a little less than the last year.
And although less new games appear with their own website, it is found on the known type, webkinz and Club Penguin, a larger offer.
There are always more bottom-working games on the market, and many contain retracable accuses.
There are some recommendations.
(Falls not different, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plots, so big as sea wine that sing a note when you press on their bowl.
Once pressing is a note, you can play a song by multiple pressures.
More Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in Harmone.
Warning: If you started with the pressure, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of sending and dancing is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) the best choice.
On the basis of the last year developed Elmo Live technology offers animatory puppet switch games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new scarnier feet with radblocking it rules the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as dance teacher. However, their parents assess the missing volume rules.
If you are a child of 80, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning games.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playcool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole employment card with which a car training can be able to train a studio hour, with a better point with autocorrect function as a teacher.
If you don't want your smartphone to trust your child, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children of 3 to 8) is the most popular and useful solution, issued with a qvality keyboard. However, the games contained in it are not as learned as the on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children of 3 to 12), which is the first biggest processing of the leapster lines with a new, brilliant screen.
No versions are compatible with older cassetts.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children of 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card device can also be considered family photos.
Finally there's still Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). Five blocks are not greater than a scrabble box and are available on a own LED screen.
In the game, it is to collect the blocks of words before the time is expired. It is great for an improvised literature competition.
Always more game machines have a kind of online connection.
If you only go after the offer in the game boards, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child a online tier in the Club Penguin, you can, for example, buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N match figurin package ($5 for children of 6 to 12), which contains a municipality with a secret code.
If you enter the online code, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two other parts.
It can be a roll shoe or a puffle-shoff.
The most recent heading microbooter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your teeth.

It's happy to send him by an irrigant from crazy.
And he's out of some.
Ours fell from the kitchentic and even over some time in the mouth of our dog.
Policies in China are intended
As a training officer stepped by Tang Shenbin over a city place, he checked his nervous undertakings and gave it with military authority and depressed commands.
He wanted to be afraid of his famous members of the Chengguan - China's strong guests of the city's order, fearing and fearing their willing racies and their song to violence - the supervisors.
"Gered stay!"
"Follow out!"
"Tell them," he fled to them, "How beautiful girls are so."
Four girls, almost developed the old teenager, with white handshots and identical olive green jacks and hosen stood smoothly.
Four couples of black Pumps stayed in the right line.
Four right shadows sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white lying hair.
"To see me average," Mr Tang notes less preciously.
"Models are beautiful."
Many governments have already tried to pull the picture of China's cities inspectors.
In one city, all new companies must have a high school conclusion.
The Province Guangdong introduced a light blue uniform instead of the grapes.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stars: 2009 reversed reports followed 50 employees a non-regularly established insect cars and guarded the driver until this half-hour packed and left the place.
Xindu, a citizen cities in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image basically.
Since 2003 13 women strengthened the citizens of police, and they were specially chosen because of their view, their good figure and their young people.
They should make a different, female aspect of the police.
However, I'm sorry that Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that has the Chinese commands of this city.
Right, that's the critics.
In other cases, as the police, these offices can only implement the citizens' laws only by helping employers or other administrative crimes.
However, the Chinese media show rutinally another image.
In January 2008, the officers in the Province Hubei were a survey to die when he filmed her with his phone, as she dropped a protesting against a mullery.
In the last year, an educational manual of the Beijing offices was locked and published on the Internet, and it is described in how criminals can be reproved without blood-profits.
In this year, a Shanghai water moleon handler is made after a manage of five exploited cerebrals.
A pre-screen video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows operators designed in China at an attack on the street handler.
"Chenguwan is afraid of the Government," lamented the National Journal of China Day in the last year, after further controversy about the taktics.
The magazine required a "really green smoking".
Sceptics are not sufficient for the current approach.
When the district in October seeked eight fair recruits in the Beijing Evening News, a editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should serve real tasks or only as optical fulfillment.
Maybe both of us.
According to the statements, women were searched in 18 to 22 with good figures and "harmonic faces" age.
You should be over average - over 1,5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 doll.
The employment relationship ends with the achievement of the 26th life year.
According to the employee, the activities for women are more than 25 body.
"The most important is her image," an unnamed district officer in the nearly government website Rednet.com.
"Of the candidates get to the job, first turn away from their external appearance, as size, weight, face skins, etc."
Then the temperature and the "inner qualities".
"The Chengguans are like flowervases," he said and added, "but they have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, the representative of the city management of the District, does not want to be committed to this description,
However, in China, the size proceedings in positions for both generations are not insufficient.
The same is applied to the same face.
If this is equal to a good view, it is constraint in China.
But people with disasters or corporate disasters do not need to be conquered.
"We can't use lambs or bucklines here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, which patrols on Baoguang-platz near a closter, is 22, has a balls and a well-formed mouth.
She does not recognize as sexy, that so great value will be placed on her view.
"Find you, I see in this uniform sexy?" she asked with an ironic view.
Your colleague with the herbs, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the job to represent the image of the city."
Their information follows they do not suffer the short setting because they had more honorable carrierplops as only handlers through the streets to cut them down in business.
Each morning, the travels with ca. twelve streets, trying to foot or on the travel rail may be sold many branches and tofuids before they continue.
"Lord Wang, please leave here."
"We have told you so often," said Mr. Xu, a hander who was fled to foot, and then he had laid him on a road carrier in the steel.
According to the employees, the activity is more monoton than a stripper.
"It's almost each day like this," explains Huang Jing, 20 students in the free time of distribution.
"All Routine."
One reason is that the officers can't fix the products of the handlers, as their men's colleagues.
You can only take criminals to report their men's provisions.
This shall protect them from public feeds which are often employed in China.
In this year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan, after the reputation cursed, had killed a manufacturer.
More than a thousand police and Chenguan officers were lost in the neighborhood case, 14 government vehicles were cut off or covered in Brand.
Xindu remained from such wealthy crisis.
However, the rebellion is not excluded.
Only two blocks removed from the quiet banguang platz, where the officers were patroled at this morning, were gathered over 50 people in a street box.
The officers had established a motor route that was repaired by the rules on the citizenship instead of a workplace.
The owner cried to Zetter and Mordio.
After 15-minute steps, the officers with grassful face went on the way to their vehicles and went out with the motor rad and his owner.
Li Juedong, 40, a man's coordinator, remained back, and he turned his white name shot to stay anonymous.
As their colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a pure supporting role.
However, they were not able to present a higher image.
"We're going forward sometimes."
"But, sometimes, even fleshly," Mr. Li explained.
"The most time the people began to fight."
State lawyer does not apply Senator Ensign
State officers of the Justice Ministry have freed Senator John Ensign of the accusations, which, after his business with an old electioner and his trial to make their husband a lobbyity to be exhausted against him, the advocates of the Senator in the Mediterranean.
This Decision ends the serious legal proposal against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. At the scandal, the country's worried outside and his carriers, he was as a possible president candidate of the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns Office was known, he was about the court after a yearly investigation "he's happy."
However, the ethicsity of the Senat may have another disciplar trap.
After examination of the advocates, they were informed of the Justice Ministry that the investigations against Senator Ensign were established and that there were no further advantages in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice does not want to be out of the case.
The court was a surprise for many Ethics advocates outside the Ministry of Justice. Its opinion was sufficient evidence for the ensign missing the lobbying contract.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents opened first in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave an opportunity to convince that Ensign Douglas Hampton, an electronic electronic helper, was allowed to pursue his shifts on an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was working during a choice campaign ensigns as a kidney master.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to make Hampton work. According to the documents and the competents he took for them after the setting of Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was shortly still in the Ensigns election team, he had no lobby work for his old employee or the whole senate.
According to the Ethik Experts, the uncommon agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which had been joined before the affairs against the such prohibition of the Drehtür Lobbycracy.
According to the published Indians, "It's all a view to a discussion and the disagreement against the trial states," so Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialized the protection of customers who are in the vision of the Government.
While the Ministry of Justice was officially refused to recognize the reasons for the decision in the Ensign Fall, Mr. Brand and other Ethians said that the Ministry seemed very careful to take political advantages after a number of disasters persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision in the past year to fall in the adoption against the previous Senator Ted Stevens because of the disagreement of the state soldier.
The State officers "invisiblely threatened," said Melanie Sloan, the Chairman of the Convention "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (the purpose of the fighting of Corruption in the United States and Government Circles), a group of jurisdictions who have made various advice against Mr. Ensign before the Court.
"This is basically that the high-governmental officers can now go out that the laws do not apply for them," added.
Paul Coggins, the Master Protector of Mr Ensign, said in an interview, he has received a phone call on the Monday and a further day in which the Ministry will not be raised up a bill against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns Protectors had cooperated with the State officers to convince them that the senator, as his office, repeatedly in a statement on the middle-second, has been "treated in conformity with the law".
Mr. Coggins denied exactly the legal arguments that he had submitted to the state officers.
"I don't even have to go in the detail between the Ministry of Justice and me, but just so much it was said, we believe that the right decision has been made," he said.
Last month, the committee has decided to set the contract elections on a separate rate by the Ethics group after a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensigns' parents to the Hamptons against the Treaty Election.
The election committee said that it was not enough evidence that the money was something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which has been supported by the Senator, was one of the company in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 states that after Mr. Hampton transferred the company as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, had a sublime with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was in the inner ministry because of a "anclope".
Mr. Ensign was also attached to Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allgiant Air, and requested the Trade Ministry to join a meeting in the name of the air community after Mr. Hampton had set up a lobby work.
In the last year, on the first time of these cases, Mr Ensign was excused by his elections and made his position in the Senat where he had been in the fourth position of the Republicans.
After a few months ago, Mr Ensign reported two weeks ago reporters that he tried a third office time in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign was not longer to be the objective of police research, his presence speaker Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hoped that the Ethics Mission was very quickly followed by the example of the Justice Ministry and set his examinations.
"Senator Ensign is glad to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," said she.
Cheshire calls notice on Twitter
A half thousand of them went away in the crawls in the Court.
In a minute, they sent their reports about gravity witnesses on Twitter.
At the end, as the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process on protection and bed-sharing children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was attempt to kill three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find a official end when the judge's obligation is fulfilled on the death judge that the jury has spoken.
However, Mr. Hayes' advocates have already submitted requests to the Court to provide the reasons for a call and which will be employed for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that it has come through the intensive reporting on the process - also by the extent use of Twitter through average reporters - to a "circusatmosphere" and a so widely widely extended, an intermediate override details, so that the jury has been affected in an insufficient way by the public disarmament.
This commitment may allow the calling judges to take care of the question of whether new technologies are necessary for new rules in the Court.
"As so as I have experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies in the Court affects the right of each individual on a good process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main protector.
The Chairman, Jon C. Blue from the headquarters of the room, which last week the requests for a short and nice decision, when he said that the new media would be "controlled courageously" and that there was no evidence that the jury was issued by disagreements.
However, it was not the last word in this matter.
Since decades, the Court of Justice has stated that the reporting on favourable cases should be surprised in the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States had taken the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopath from Cleveland, who should kill his wife, and said in his decision that it had given a "carnevaltsmaster in the Court" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "Out the flight" based on this crime.
Some jurisdictions say that the judges of Mr. Hayes considered a half century later, may follow the argument that new rules have been necessary to regulate the ways of communication from the Court, which were still unpreparable during the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"It is a good reason for the influence of the new media in processes that are persecuted by a large publicity," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death trial in Connecticut. His report will be obviously agreed.
Professor Donohue said that some of the calls judges could be fascinated by the idea that the limit of an intermediate communication from the Court could make the processs better.
The Twitter business is only one of many who describe the laws of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and thus make a condemnation.
For example, the Protectors also said that Mr. Hayes had already been judged as the Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurisdictions by showing them gravity tatortfotos during the jurisdiction.
Some of the jurists said, photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their shadows, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled them with Abscheu.
The Protectors say that they would also take a question of the consciousness of the Dead Straight Constitution, and argument that the judge had in case of a jurisdiction that was a criticism of the State Agency and that he would have exercised an irregular pressure on the judgment when he had adopted the unnormal decision to free the jury on the weekend.
The jurists were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may be the greatest interest.
In a jurisdiction that they have made the past month, they stated that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and were discussed during the election fight for the Governor's office and for the American Senate by the candidates.
They argued that the new media continued to develop the flowers of emotions on the case.
"A day-day Andrang of the media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the Court of Justice," writes the jurisdiction officer, "what you are still in New Haven and may not even live in the country."
Your hard point on the reporting by Twitter is controlled.
In Interviews, some journalists said that the fact that these direct messages are more higher than the reports that are replaced longer is a technical view that warms the reporting on future processes.
However, some legal officers said that the advocations judges often would be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed by the adaptation.
Mr. Hayers law officers strengthen this respect.
In their intention, they considered the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard was subjected to the reporting statement and made clear that the new media required new rules.
"This case," she wrote, "presented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can the challenge connect the separator?
After a campaign on shipping and negativity, this week is cutting a little dead in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of the illusion before you return to the battle of the parties in the main city?
The meeting between President Obama and Spitzens of the Congress has not made a break in the great issues with the "lame duck session" of the meeting at the end of a government period where no decisions were taken any more.
After all that you hear, there was no high discussion between two different pages or a respect of their shared responsibility, but more than an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meetings of the President's Deficit Commission on Middle Wednesday were simultaneously civilised, but the political differences continued to be among the members.
It seems to be clear that an energy interaction on a period of months has a contrast respect that is the ideal climate that continues to train the members of each other.
It's not enough to say that it's a new surgery of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromissibility is required, while you are trying to decline the limits of public opinion and the patient of the electorers after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meetings at the Sunday were limited to a minimum requirements or accusations by participants.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and deep than that you may expect a quick wallet of the atmosphere who had been dominated in the past two years.
While it goes to steel, speeds, health, or expectations, both sides are remote from each other.
Finally, the November election of Washington has voted at least for a short time mild.
"No question, the sound case has changed," said Pete Wehner, a official representative of the Bush Government, which now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is increasingly after choice.
Choose partial distresss that are dead again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrates have no other choice than finding a solution."
Bush's assets ends in the year, and nobody makes it.
Both pages want to find a way to keep some or more of them, if it is current or permanent.
It is also a compromiss to wait for the higher employment payment, although only because the republicans can't help that they believe that the favorized taxes for riches, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on the Sunday in the White House, the optimism has increased that you can ratify the new START Treaty in these questions during the "lame duck session" and simultaneously ratify the new START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of Brookings Insight warns that a successful cooperation in the urgent issues of the lame duck session should not lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new congress is called in January 112.
Instead, he says that it is a phase of the unrecommendation, maybe even unable.
"After the things that have to be done, these short-term psychology will be struck in confrontation," he said.
The weapon is also skeptical - and this scepse is divided by many - the ability to real cooperation.
"I see many things happen from today to 2012, as a forward fight or box, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are much to make the new Republican majority in the white house and to the Teeparty choices that were served by their education.
How the Republican leaders also want to be able to be highly pokered that they know that they must try to send their promises to the Government's expenditure and to put the health reform outside the power.
These parties are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, clearly, which includes a reform and the reform of certain staff, as well as the reaching of the relief and the rate of the state expenditure.
The President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have taken, in accordance with their own estimation, so much to put the deficit question on the public day scheme that they can't be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of 18 votes to make their official recommendation plan and to fight very much to come close to this number.
The greatest resistance is in the selected representatives of the Greece, since in financial questions, at least today, is only a few gamespaces or a few symptoms for compromises.
Galleston says two phases in battle between the white house and the Republicans in the Congress.
The first battle will be located in the form of party agreements in the next year when the Republic of Obama requests the country's household, controls and health system, then followed by a phase greater than two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this wall?
The public opinion.
It is evidence that, although the party of the current election, most Americans still want to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a sack gas, how happened 1995, both parties should be careful about the public reaction.
Whoever is still judged to lose, will change the course and search for the compromise.
It can actually be a optimistic view.
Partiality and polarisation are today greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideal climate between Obama and the Congress Republicans than his time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parts of 2010 are a pure example for a consecution in the meaning of 2012.
So it is possible to be welcomed by many Americans to be blessed this week.
However, on both sides it will be very much more difficult to find a joint name in the questions that both separate each other.
Transsecured US document ported Moscow as the hair of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Kleoptmocracy" and it gives a part of the payment and the protection money that she collects, continued to the crowl, and reported in February the American message in Russia in a memo.
As well as the police and the State Security Service press high protection payers to keep their pure life standards in Moscow, it is.
They collect money not only of legitimated businesses but also of organized criminal bands.
Each shield of the Burokracy - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has marked as "Vertical of the Authority" - takes its part from the money that the leader turns up.
The Memo, which was sent under the name of John Beyrle to Washington, was published on the Sunday of WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The note is based on sources which have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a citizen, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was held in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is no evidence that it would be reached in the mid-time.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who possesses a known building company, have always rejected corruption constructions for years, and he has won a lot of sufferings against such accusations.
In September he explained a Russian television senter when he was asked after a documentation, which suggested that he was corrupt, "It's crazy, it's threatened, it's hard."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unlikely that, as it happened in the report of the Board, individuals will be called, and it is not heard that this happens through a diplomat of an external country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with criminality has led to some of them as a "stracted" and to conclude that the Government is more like a Kleoptokrate than a government."
"Kriminal elements enjoy a "krishna" (a term from the world of crimes / the Mafia, which significantly means "Da" or protection), which is about the police, the State Security, the Service Authority (MVD) and the Office of the State Agency, as well as through the whole Mosca Government Bureau.
Facilities have detected a triangle structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is on the top."
"FSB, MVD and Miles are on the second level."
"In recently, the ordinary crimes and criminal inspectors on the bottom level."
"This is an incompetent system in which the criminal groups in some areas are closing a lot because the city does not offer any help."
The report further says that the FSB's money is cut off from the largest company and that the police arrests small business leaders.
A source that means "declared that Moscow's business officer understands that it's best to get the protection from MVD and FSB (and not from the organizated crime) because they have no more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection is no longer asking as before."
The note notes that, while the collection of the money is increasing, the protection itself will not be very decisive; even those who pay, sometimes will be arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business very quickly closed - because of one or another advantage.
Medvedev has spoken many times to fight corruption, but it has noticed that he has only made a little progress.
The Memo of the message contains descriptions of men with coppers that probably were full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must leave himself on the bureaucrates," said George Satarov, director of India, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not a part of the political class because a political class in Russia doesn't exist anymore."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the guests, he says that corruption is unlikely.
In the country, so estimated India, the Russian Corruption costs more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country raises a new investigation on the global corruption by the non-State Organization Transparence International (the countries are established by the "a less corrupt" to "am most corrupt").
The emergency of the memos of the American news that happened later after Moscow's time will be solved with security in the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused for the fault of Moscow, it can also be a possibility to say that the problems are resolved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin said that WikiLeaks documents could be a failure and reacted to the enthusiasm that American diplomas called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction that is a important factor of the internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected that this happens with such arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans for confrontation with the past
In a hard lighting, betoned class room with painful and smoking walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him at the late Khmer Rouge Leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone loves Ta Mok here."
"He was a good leader, and he was worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
According to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge Government, the command officer remains in the age of Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest Cambodschas popular, where he built hospitals and bridges who developed the infrastructure and where thousands of old soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the capital of Khmer Rouge against the Government, long-year annual additives are required in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and distribution forum allowed the victims to have the public confrontation with people who first supported the regime.
In June, the Government distributed a school book, which first tells the history of Khmer Rouge to children.
And in July, a Community staff of UNO and Cambodschas first condemned a married member of Khmer Rouge than the former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng Folter room, King Khek Iev, a better known than the Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With all these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veteranen Alnlong Vengs has increased their efforts to reintegration and reintegration in Cambodschas society.
"It's still a pleasure and fear in the old Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation center of Cambodschas, an independent organization who studied the regime.
"For her life was under the Khmer Red Great, but the regime became a symbol of the wicked."
"It's split yourself families."
During the Khmer Rouge Government in Cambodscha, between 1975 and 1979, 1,7 million people were exempted or died in disease, transaction or famine.
When the Vietnamese influences and 1979 shot the Popo Pot-Ied Government, the rest of the regime and his military soldiers fled to the borders of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they broke up until December 1998, as the last movement captured.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountain and the Dschungel of Kambodscha, Ta Mok went to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of 1990, as an UNO's promoted peace agreement 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country, great groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to government, which led to the capitals of Jeng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died 1998 a natural death, and Ta Mok, who didn't mention, was arrested by Government forces at the Dan Greek Mountains.
He died 2006 in Phnom Penh's prison, where he was waiting for his process.
When their gods hadn't protected them longer, most of the old Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the dead poverty of the rural Cambodge and many had the move in nostalgic memory.
Even if some of the extreme offices of Khmer Rouge maintained their local government costs, because they dropped their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, unfigured buildings.
"These people have only benefited very little from capitalization," said Sok Leang from the Centre of Justice and Relief, which is in the whole Cambodscha, also in Anlong Veng, public forms
"They are infected in the outopic agriculture of the regime."
"They grow without any professional science."
Sor Lim, 55 years, who held in 1974 as the Teenager of the Rhmer Red, fighted in the Dschungel for Anlang Veng before he was down 1998 to lead a life as a poor river.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Tha Mok gave everybody to eat."
"But now the life is hard because we need to worry about ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also grown concerns here.
In the beginning of the next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another previous Khmer Rouge Minister.
The commitment of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the crimes, but it is not said whether it will be persecuted on these four cases.
It's a little more important to lie to the stresss in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have been concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years, which were during Khmer Rouge Government in the late 1970s district chefin in the Province Manteay Meanchey.
2007, she told the posters of the documentation center of Cambodscha that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably died in the thousands of weak workers.
In a famous night in Chaem from the work on the fields to their wood house returned to a painful road outside of Anglo Veng.
When the long shadows of the sun on the wounded grass declined in the chaem to discuss about their pastness in the Khmer Rouge.
If the Court foretold her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Kambodscha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there's no persecution, it would be a war here."
President Hun Sen, who has fled from the Khmer Rouge 1878, has also warned that the situation would be unsecured, the court would be more surprised, although experts and historicals discuss this.
"Kambodscha has to bury a loch and buried the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodscha needs to do to go forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation center.
"Following with the Khmer sites means the composition of the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our obligation to put these broken parts together so that it can understand everything."
The Centre created the first of the Government approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75 pages "The History of the Democratic Cambodscha".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to historical book for the High School of the Ministry, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Red.
How often in Cambodscha the young people in Anlong Veng know only little about the Khmer Rouge, instead of the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand a major part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book with home to read it.
"My family shares many parts of the book and the judgment," he said.
"They are increasing because they are not sure how many people are judged by the judgment."
A such resistance makes complex and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public Forces, the school book and the court received and after influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful relationship here.
Top in the Dan Greek mountains brings one of the streams overwhelmed and with plastic pieces distracted way to a rectangle of black road, covered with a strong steel.
Pol Pots body was burned here after his death 1998.
Nuum Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile shooter on the street border, said, she doesn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuum Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots the last restroom where she was cutting a bush of reward bananas - in hope he brings her happiness.
White Russland has therefore agreed to collect Uran more weaponsable uran
In a surprised guidance for President Obamas Campaign on global security nuclear materials, the Government of White Russland announced that you will not be gathered longer than a higher uran, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was made known in a common statement after a meeting of the Foreign Ministry Hillary Rodham Clinton with the White Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Martynov in a additional article of the Security Gipfel.
The United States Government tried to convince the White Russland, not to collect a higher uran and seemed to have a threat in the last morning.
However, the U.S. Government officials reported Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with the White Russland were made to remove 187 pounds of armed Uran from a White Russian research station.
This prepared the bunch for the convention at the middle-second to remove the rest of the material - according to a official collaborator who remains anonymous because of the sensibility of the subject.
The Agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas "Nuclear Security Gipfels of 47 nations" of April, who had been excluded by the White Russia.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next green 2012.
"I was really concerned of the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear Security Gip (except 2012)."
"This proves me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the Agreement "a very significant, important step" of White Russland.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prag to ensure all precautive nuclear materials within four years.
Since the Government of the United States has helped six countries to lose your highly accurate Uran.
White Russia will be the seventh.
A thousand countries did it under the Government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obamas Nuclear Security Gipfel, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never be raised up their Uran.
"Who keeps highly gained Uran - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weaponsable, and less accurate Uran," said Lukashenko.
"This is our weak substance, we're not gonna make a weak bomb and we'll sell it to nobody."
"We use it exclusively for research weakes, that's all."
White Russland, however, was near the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in meetings of a agreement.
The first call to remove Uran White Russland in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily broken, says official.
It was carried out in a special ship that says more than 1.300 miles to a Russian manufacturer for saving and reaching, officials.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officers per aeroplane.
The US Government pays for these taxes $14 million, where a largest part of the money in the white Russian research with weighted uran, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and declined to build confidence," which led to the Agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry who works in the global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for non-extensive studies estimates that the White Russland in this year had at least 88 pounds of armed Urans and hundreds of pounds to higher uran.
White Russland wants to resolve its laser until 2012 according to the Joint Agreement.
The relations between the White Russ and the United States were aged for years, in the first line, because Lucashenko's serious disagreement of human rights.
But the statement of the Mediterranean suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcome, the United States of America and White Russia know that a higher respect for democracy and human rights in White Russia is a central subject in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
No income of the Spanish Government against CIA flows
The Spanish Government had no income against the CIA flows with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners on the Spanish State Area to Guantánamo, such as from a telegram of the US E.U.A. in Madrid.
The spreads of Wikileaks and the day period "El País" (per box) documents. It is added that the former governance team María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested the Spanish government to be informed to "to demonstrate that external aircrafts who are over Spain will be monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report of the European Council, where the human rights practices were included in a thousands of countries, including Spain, were discussed by the former North American Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The establishing Government team made the report of the Council "habe Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"Dela Vega understretch, Spain has no income against the Secret Service Flights on Spanish State Area."
"You just want to be informed," not "in preparation to be surprised", reported Aguirre per box.
Also the former Foreign Ministry, Miguel Angel Moratinos, as the newspapers say that the Spanish Government "the matter does not want to give great attention, although the Government has only little influences because these are in the hands of the judges."
The State Officer Vicente Gonzalez, in January 2007, had to understand that he would not block the legal initiative, the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flows.
"This report does not contain any loading or sensitive information," said the reporter after a conversation with the officer.
However, the United States were concerned about the "visible coordination between the Spanish State Agency and the German state officers" than the declared information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to discrete training between governments," Aguirre said.
At a meeting in March 2007, where the reporter of the United States and the Spanish Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, recently commented that "because the Spanish judges are very strongly considering their undependence and do what they have to be appropriate," he gave his co-operators his comments, "unable to prohibite rhetorical comments to leave Spanish."
The newspaper also expressed his concern on the progress of the PP in this matter.
"Travel of its general pro-American maintenance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not be doubtful, as a result, that the Government of the United States Zapateros actions that could be made as possible human rights disorders, tolerated or ignored, the capital will be punished, even if these commitments could be negatively affected by the Government of the United States."

Then she mentions a communication that she just received on the phone: "I want you to return this month or let me get a address to you."
She said, "If he doesn't like me to leave the boy with my mother, I'll take him away when I'm back."
In May she says about the return to her town, "This week I will go there, but I will stay just until 19th, because I have to present me on 20th to a work if I don't want to lose them."
She explains that they take their firstborn when it's okay.
"He will be with whom he must be, that means me, and I will never leave him again with anyone except with my mother," a doubtful view when you get their bad relationship.

Popular Partido won 4 sites in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant votes and delegations in the last regional elections, the PP has already proceeded to the Parliament's elections - or not. Their expectations are more positive than the number of votes that are given to these elections is usually doubled as the elections in Catalonia.
So the Catalan people party received 610.473 votes in the Parliament's elections of 2008, while these numbers were attached to the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Last Sunday, PPC 384.091 votes.
If this higher tendency - the result of the migration of the PSC and the binding of the PP, the PP analysis would prognose that the PPP could increase the PPC of 8 to 12 congress agreements, although CiU four (see now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 degrees (des 25).
These calculations include the fundamental significance of Catalanians for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people party, the ERC would lose an agreement - now they have three - while ICV could keep their reports or win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date is fulfilled with the collective elections in May 2011, and the people party (PP) can also be the language at the car, to prepare the socialist preside, and in four cities and with its majority in the city Council of Barcelona, one of the citizens' administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Even the nationalists and the people parties agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists will not reach a majority or to their traditional connections (ERC and ICV).
After the Republic Debakel, this party is not avoidable to lose its representation in the assembly Council of Barcelona, where they have to hear 5% of the votes.
The PPs signed have a growth of their voting fields in the four provincial cities and could be to be a determinant force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to play the main role in Tarragonas Return, where they had governed before the current citizen, Josep Felix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
A Lerida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The citizen master, Angel Ros, holds a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election war.
In other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldevels or Rius, the people party could also describe a significant growth.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 town administrations of Catalan and encourages the education of lists in many places as possible.
The Catalan cell visited Al Qaida thousands of travel passengers
Except the seven festivals in Barcelona were three more in Thailand
The seven of the policemans of the police of the police of Barcelonas, Pakistans and Nigerians, set out from Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Moving to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba " (Let) - the last author of the Attentate in Bombay, the 106 dead requested - with payments.
The Spanish Inland Ministry shows these researchs a great importance that is so far that he ensures that the "operation Campaign" is the failure device Al Qaidas worldwide "behaviour" and "so their operational ability".
The researchers say that in the two years, in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of feeds were sent to Thailand, where these fails and then were sent to groups from which the criminal galaxie Al Qaida had been sent to override the borders of Europe and other western countries.
The objective cell is not the only of the Dschidistic network that was active in Europe; therefore, other European police units have been affected except the Thailand research organisations, and it is not to be excluded that there are similar expectations in the EU area in the next days, such as the last service in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistan Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asgar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerianian Babatunde Agunbiade) was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistan Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Hessan Butt and the Thailand of Sirikalaya Kijbuum.
They had led from Bangkok from the cells laid down in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it was notified in 2009 - particularly tourist parts according to the proposals of the "Islamic Front International".
This means that the documents on the names of men of 25 to 45 years should be issued and have to be valid for many years; they should not show the visa temperature.
In the research crowds, there is no connections between the Catalonia and the attention in Bombay could be shown until now, although the author of this attention, Laschkar e-Taiba, was one of the recipient groups locked in Spain, and then in Thailand.
However, it should be reminded that some days before the attention of Catalonias from a money transfer undertaking were sent several thousands of dollars who were invested in the buying of Prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were used later by the members of the "Commandos", the life of 106 persons.
The police has adopted a great documentation.
PP requested by mass a remuneration of the assets agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday, Artur Mas, personally, to propose its conditions to support his official responsibility as the President of the Generality, and these are not distinguished from those already during the election campaign, and are made with the priority of the economic renewment and the membership of regional independence, such as a financial equal agreement that the regionalist leader wants to be made at the height of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic Popular Party turned out with the security of Artur Mas, which you lost the 18 deposits that they win on the last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel invisible, because the candidate from the citizen-regionalistic Party CiU is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties contained at the vote of his vote.
The future reports that the regionalists want to enter in the future Parliament's elections in the Congress have declined from a possible entity with the PP, and the talk that the mass leads to time with the other parties turned to Catalonia.
As regards the Party President of the PPC, this requires that the support of the Office "all discussions relating to the Sub-Agency and Independence of Catalan" and a agreement on the financial comparison between the State and the Autonome Region - like in Baskenland - and the party of CiU will also be subject to a reference.
Both political leaders are common that they make the established political apparatus of the regional administration and want to make the products and gifts.
With the details of the negotiations on the office of mass, the PPC Jordani Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are employed.
But he has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has a hard opposition announced - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will come together with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidarity Catalana).
The age member confirms that death cases are not to return to "false measures"
The owner of the old house in Olot doesn't conclude that your manager killed over 11 older people
The responsibilities of the Old Federal House of La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they made it, in which the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmes - the leader who had been killed at least 11 old people for whom he had been able to kill - the establishment was added.
The Leader of the Old Federal House, Joan Sala, held in joining his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the judge, and announced "La Caritat wants to attach the responsibility (for death cases)," but "the right and our obligation are committed to accept the process and civilization."
The establishment should not only take a society loss because it did not have established the criminal actions of the holder, but now also pay a high defense sum calculated by the representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilme found that the first crime was returned at August 2009 and that he was killed afterwards.
The judge ordered the exhaustion of eight bodies - old patients of the old office - because he convinced that no doctor had investigated the dead persons, but the formalities were developed phoneally because of their age and disease.
The leader of La Caritat denied this point around and explained that "the resting measures could not be caused for the cases."
The lawsman of La Caritat added that it was "no indication for traveling actions other than the accused person."
The already been baptized as "Dead English" 11 murders and explained that the first crime was destroyed on 29 August 2009, and one half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed an overdose insulin, in the difference of the first crime in which he had caused a mixing of various insulins.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the person's access to medicines is only hard to control.
The insulins prits and the cocktail cocktail made the leader in six of nine entire crimes to deliver patients with death from their pain.
But the results of the laboratories are shown whether Vila lying and for his first victims, actually chose a few grassive death, or if he burned them outside, by exhibiting them the plot, as he had done with three women who murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, you don't give the statements of the leader, not once what the number of the murders could be more. This option is justified that Vila had made very different states before the judge and that it doesn't mean to change his action after the eight successful murder.
They say they have been available for this reason and to declare the richness of these cases of justice.
Drugs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors were responsible yesterday to the threat of the President of the ECB Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not understood our reaction facilities."
The risks of euro peripheral countries are dramatically increased and the actions of the European banks are more than 5%.
In the same way, we should not consider the possibility that the ECB may be able to achieve and that the euro has not been attached to points that are concerned.
The events of yesterday are typically for a unlimited market in which he recoveres again, but according to the closement of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional leader will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to reject our liquidity measures, where the ECB must be turned tomorrow to the fourth time in two years, and probably sometimes in the future.
The Budget Bank requested the implementation of the plan to purchase State Courts, since these are ineffective and the replacement of all extraordinary liquidity measures. It should be maintained only a weekly unfreeable access.
After the Ireland crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended at least to March, and the four-year-year explanations with unlimited access in the quarter-end to ensure the liquidity to at least June.
We also expect that the programme to purchase obligations continues and will be issued with a strong signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reactions of the markets will be restored from yesterday and if it is hardly stopped to take our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank forced not to take account of the purchase of State Courts and to collect the markets on it, this story could be reiterated tomorrow.
The ECB must be faithful and sustainable.
In May she showed the dentals and on midnight said she had already buyed a lot of things that she had produced a new break of the market.
Yesterday, the exhibition of a yearly state titles in Portugal was very hard.
The State Management was only 500 million to 5,28%, about 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
However, the inches in Portugal falled around 30 basic points in the whole curve and reflected the change of the market by the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the numbers of allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum will be estimated at about 10,000 million short-term and possible 15,000 more. There is time to establish private capital, or these banks will be cleared.
Although Ireland had completely lost his credibility after the problem with the striking test in July, the numbers in the framework of the saving plan are acceptable and helped to reduce the unwiseness.
However, the Government on the next Sunday has to receive Parliament's agreement to its new budget plan, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of unknownness.
Angela Merkel has raised its discussions on the front of the officers and the Government on 14 December, and there is a political unit to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that German Wagner wants to play, and the other countries are the nine Sinfonia Beethovens.
The Spanish Government President proposed last night the action plan to adopt the Ministry Council's freedom.
Reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, construction of the State's deficit, liberalization, privacy and training measures.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish built has added to 4,5 per cent, is doubled as the rest of the European offices.
In comparison to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convinced, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is an essential accommodation of a three-year-year state leader that will take use from the trichet effect, so we make a strong question that will be surprised to all the doubts of our disasterability.
For Spain, the request of a help plan would be a self-to-do offer.
We would have a liquidity that we don't need, and the debtor has been available for 40 billion euros, three times so much as in March.
However, our strategy should say to Motto Cesar's wife: "Now it is not only his, but also the shoe."
It's just a courage, we're doing it!
The President of Eulen, on request of his children, the company meeting of Vega Sicilia
The sturm in the open conflict of the family Alvarez, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not happy.
David Alvarez, the cerebral of the company gorge, will start the company collection of El Enebro, which will be found on the request of five of his seven children on 16th place, because he keeps them "absolutely not". His children will be trying to get a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - inhaberin of the wine Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus, David and Mary Joseph, prepared the legal measures for a new justice chapter in their war to control a part of the company group.
The ground of the largest Holding for enterprise services does not seem to be ready to provide the control of El Enebro's organs.
He was taken out of the Administrative Council from five of his seven children, and they were invited to members of the Administrative Council of 18 January of this year, which have already been introduced in the trade record.
The company collection of El Enebro, which was called by the judge of the Trade Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has released a new submission in the office of the Alvarez family.
The calling of the judge to renew the congregation is the only legal way that ensures the vocation of the Community assembly.
The last strategy of John Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta i Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz will be made by David Alvarez as a "sabel medium of the applicant - his five children - issued in order to recognize judicial skills, judicial skills and judicial use for the unexplied congregation of 18 January", as official Sprees.
This argument is the basis for the refugee of the congregation in the back to explain it as "in absolutely none".
The same protagonists who have been fulfilled in discovery swallows have already tried to call a congregation on junior way.
In El Enebro, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other energy values - controls David Alvarez' seven children 100% of the capital.
Hinngen requests the origins of the service group, according to the family protocols, the right of use is more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the matter that the judges in the audience on the treatment of the insurance plan for which no date has been established.
Red Bull seats in the F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
The cars will be improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004 ends in the world of the Formel 1, their history in this reading Universe is achieved by the speed of surprises and success.
In the beginning, no one gave the newlying observation and, although his part of the last saisons were set at the end payment in the last November all on the winning of Fernando Alonso.
Without the capacity of the German Pilot and the World Master of Sebastian Vettel or the delivery of the engine of Renault, it is the "secret weapon", which put in the hands of the Multi Siemen's Red Bull, and that he created a shipping team, became league.
In fact, there is a hard software for the simulation of processes that have made the German company 2007 not to do with authors on the market.
This PLM's information programme was used for the development of mountage catches in fabrics throughout the world, energy works and high-preparing tools.
A reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to prevent such mistakes and overflow costs.
PLM has improved the development of Canon cameras, the sukhoi airports and the most fair useful vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, leader of the Industrial Department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the form 1 - Fabrik Red Bull " in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are established on the road and tests.
Russwurm explains that 1992 worked averagely ten technology that could be introduced in a saison at least three or four improvements.
In the Red Bulls Team, 180 high-qualifised young people are employed today. With EDV driving ages, they analyse and all possible changes on the training car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software was in the ability to analyze and improve all the components of the rent cars of Red Bull, except the engine that only Renault is responsible for himself.
The materials, powers, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred through progressive production and highch keyboards within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality.
The only limits set by this crazy technical perfectionisme are the 40 million dollars, which can expose a formula 1- team for its vessels in a saison.
Red Bull has built his high-fabric for the development and production of his rent cars in a remote location of London.
It is about two buildings in which visits - especially journalists - strongly limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
It contains 580 persons, including two pilots, the World Master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formel 1 - Held is doubtless the most recent world master Sebastian Vetell.
Besides the large technological resources that the Energy drinker provides in the services of its participation on the road streets, other protogonists are hidden, which are unvaluable and their knowledge is equal to zero.
The technology of the work, Steve Nevey, indicates that you could still say that the progress in the F&E area for training cars with 50 per cent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the participation values have changed. Technology makes 85 per cent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 per cent.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber never can be replaced by EDV because they are "invisible Gladiators".
HP is opened in two years by 20 own loads with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) went yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive loads in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first one of the twenty employees' sales networks with 80 to 100 square meters to open the multis in the next two years in Spain.
The society agrees with this initiative with the existing 16 sales in multi-market business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The representative of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, called for example the rebuilding load at the Great Via in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, collaborated with the HP since 30 years.
The North America Employment Group is intended to set up 200 sales in Europe until 2010, from 20 reductions in Spain.
The first week was included in Bukarest (Ruman) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera didn't want to raise the future new openings, but not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The staff president, also leadership of HP personal systems, ensures that the philosophy for the opening of the laptop is always the same. It is a local equipment with experience and branch knowledge.
The North America Employment Group provides this and takes the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products), and in Europe all loads will be looked like it.
Furthermore, HP is complied with the training of the laden person.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a Francising system, and that it had been observed with the exclusive sale network, "the customer service and the advice of smaller and smaller companies at the sale and then, even to optimize the packages."
The load in Barcelona is available on a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with guarantee.
A online service built a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"To this way, we can resolve in 10 minutes problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and smaller and privacy businesses, because the major companies have already had their service contracts for technical customer service," explained Helena Herroro.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million clients 'clauen'
The business member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is optimist than another manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and prophecy of the end of the crime war.
However, he sees an income of payments that try to compare the banks with the increase of payments and the prices for the damage.
Sabadell expects to take a million privacy billion in three years - another existing case.
Sabadell has found the way to get out of the next three years and so to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new triangle plan 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without prejudice to the public assistance from the FROB, but from above the market parts for a million privacy accounts - 700 000, if the customers are disappearing to lose the bank. This is the great requirement that this bank stands before, since it has increased more attention than their privacy.
In this year, it has received 250 000 privacy accounts and 50 000 enterprises.
Your market share in private accounts is at 3,5 per cent, while the business studies are exceeding 10 per cent.
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, speaking austerity, cost reduction, and the requirements that the bank corresponds to it will be presented together with an annual conclusion report.
Only a few banks are intended to establish and publish objectives in these difficult times, since all bank plans have been made through the financial crisis worldwide.
Sabadell will be concluded in this year for four years by Optima. This was initially released for three years, but according to the market plan he was extended for a business year.
The customers who are left the Sparks are the main goal of the Bank.
At one of the organizated APE organized Guardiola, 2011 would be a "gravity" year "with great richage."
The manager comes out, Spain only comes out of the crisis.
Furthermore, it would be very difficult, in two or three years, basically for the overliving of the banks.
Even if he appears that the war against Pasiva - which will be able to discharge the cine margins, the risks, the banks and spots for their emissions must pay for liquidity, as a comparison for weaponing wines are already covered on the price for credit.
"The subjects of liquidity and financing are structural and they will take pressure on the credits."
"We didn't turn the hair off, but the ring differences are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already been issued on the Sunday to restrict the delivery of long-term delays and to increase the differences (e.g. Cinco Days of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also concluded that the banks had now persecuted the statistics " to increase the payments", however "in one frame of the competition".
Sabadells Leitplan based on an organic growth, even if the group, asever, does not exclude corporate businesses.
He is not usually ensuring that in Spain "the biggest companys are needed."
"In the next year, everything will be changed," he ensures.
He indicates that the need for the capital is currently "great" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be broken in red numbers.
It is the opinion that the FROB may replace the money market in capital receptions.
After he ensure that Sabadell can also survive a transit closing of the markets, he ensures the argument of some bankers who already have a new liquidity crisis.
He says that you can do nothing in turn, but in different cases in June, you can get a short-term financial on repository and receive the crisis.
CECA closes a second fusion room of the spruits
The General Director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, held yesterday the possibility that it could come to a fusion room of the Sparks and noticed the speed with which the branch would be restructed.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Sparkassen began, several sparkas were not participated in the first phase, and they were maintained the second rounds.
Henggen confirmed the Director-General of Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish Smartbands (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not be found.
"I believe that the largest part of the fusions has been completed. The relationship with Cajasol to the Banca Cívica group could not be considered as the second round, it was more about adjustments."
"The largest part is completed, and it may be that we have in place of seventy or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has supported all the progress."
At one of the employment managers and the manager of Aragonians (ADEA), Olavarrieta made out that the concentration process was so quickly fulfilled and that we must be satisfied with the fresh right ship that has been established in recent times, not now, in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España.
"The transition of 45 sparkases with average 28,000 million passengers at 17 with 75,500 million is a historical incompatible process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62 per cent and they are now very greater than we have fulfilled the Base Agreement."
Olavarrieta explained, "It gives a number of unbelievable opinions about the length of the process, the uncertainty and insensitivity" because "Banco de España reminds us to conclude fresh right before the end of the year."
The Director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, was yesterday ensuring that Spain had one of the most rigorous financial systems of Europe and that might be fulfilled in the whole world, and that those who had to do this "increasing knowledge".
The manager noted that we should do in the current economic convention "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and spruits that have made a "excellent" concentration process that will be fulfilled as fast as possible.
He also remembered that the Spanish banks had very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Lines Germany
Berlin has decided for the euro's holding, but it has established a simultaneous conditions for the entire European Union.
A double response of the Government has been solved on the markets.
On the other hand, Joseph Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting in control measures for small and smaller undertakings, the regulation of time-employment, or the upgrade of 426 euros for unemployment unemployment, which will not take place for privacy of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of the State lottery.
On the other hand, Elena Salgado supports the establishing Government team, with the ex-gondo President Felipe González, the criticism in the Canzler Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these actions to understand?
It has been prejudiced that the label position is not the error of its public work.
In addition, it is a new round in the difficult process of the re-definition of the Euro.
In this context, Germany takes a fundamental new perspective for the establishment of our future, which is collided with the maintainment of the alertified traditions of a large part of his partner.
In view of the resistance in Europe, there are three possible expenditures from the crisis in Germany.
First: a strong Euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South must leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it is now more than Science Fiction - supported by a major part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third: a restructuring of the Euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more macroeconomic controls; strict budget rules; violation of the countries that are transmitted to the proposals; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawn since some time, therefore there is no excuses now.
First 2009, as well as the EWF, as well as the European Commission, made a deficit, and the German Government went out a reform of reform from the railway to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the separate department between what German had been kept for necessary (creasing office plans and stabil public finances) and the practices of his European partners, including France.
The second character set the Middle-European country, as mark, the decision to save Greece was very painful.
The strong crisis has been criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion was absolutely against a Greece's saving.
Finally, the Market will be issued in the last October day with a clear position, which requires a reform of the European Union's Agreements to allow a country to save and at the same time the private suppliers to take a part of the cost.
This position was issued as an anti-European because it was the Irish crisis and all the following proposals.
However, its proposal was adopted in the next months, and we will participate in the European Union's reform that will allow these measures since 2013.
Germany has gone a red line that doesn't remember it.
It says to all that, even if now unlimited measures must be taken, it will no longer be given the older functionality of the Euro.
2013 will be the birth year of a new monetary room in which the adjoined countries may be able to clarify that payment is impossible, and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to attach a serious growth course, with high-scale and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improvement of production and competitiveness and positive external sales.
The other alternative, which is covered in the payment balance, as it has been carried out from Spain in boom-times, will not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not only because the State's deficit to be low to three per cent until 2013.
The requirements are much worse.
And the worst thing that we could do in these conditions is to be courageous to ourselves.
I hope that the current Turbulens will go in more rest.
And that we use the opportunities that will be commanded to be used until March 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has so understanded, and its double advertising (the promised reforms after talking with the big companies on the past Sunday and the invitation of new measures from yesterday) indicates that, although the criteria on mark, the hypothesis is to create a order in its own house, he has prepared their way.
But the red line of Germany is there, and it doesn't seem that it would change something.
Under the opportunities in view is that we should not leave the euro area that was fully stopped with a few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has warned us.
Sports and rules
Tricks like the Alonso and Ramos in the game show the findings of the Ajax, but not the desire to run a sanction.
The exception of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League had done that a lot of timing had been made about whether it was unportable or did not and whether both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As usually known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (the team had already wind clearly) time and played several fouls to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fill the sanction prescribed at the next range of loops against the Audres and then put without cards into the next game phase.
Finally, the EUFA disciplineary committee made the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the participated players with various money payments.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is most often in the world of the football.
She is so wide that she is part of the Ethos - the unscripted rules, but in this sport's rules - is.
A part of the discovery on the case showed is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (the one in his Hymne Edelmut and Honor) (and in other opportunities the players had made its players for similar cases) played the main role, and to the dramatication by Mourinho, which added an episode more to his long history than theatrical and manufacturer technology.
In any case, the debate is turned on whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the states against the principles of the sport, that means whether these actions have a rule to be made.
In this case, it should be examined by the sports-profits.
The sport guest defends the corporate injustice of the joints, aspect that was not dangerous by these actions, because it was no aggressive game.
Another aspect of a serious game is to prevent that the remote training games take a unjustly use out of the gender team. It does not happen.
The paradox of the acting of the player of real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under the false game or regulation, because the environment of the rule was not held secretly to delay a sanction, but it should be so absolute as possible to be punished by the judge.
The players waited and took the sanction gladly.
Another question is what kind of benefit the advice negotiations have gone out of the obvious foul.
Here should be suggested that the Rivale has not been brought into an unexpected situation or has been raised for the game played, because the manifest result of this action was that the own team with less players should continue.
There is no useful strategy for the next game, because the club doesn't have any of these players.
The property is obviously that the player starts the next game of Champions League without cards that could take their participation to a future game.
But it is about a longer time until a certain grade is unknown, since the team may also be separated. Moreover, the players have a sanction with this process and go into the second cycle, where they separate the card with a card less than in the first cycle.
That's not so clear if it's really involved in a benefit.
Finally, such actions are not intended to the sports whose strategic decisions are included in order to make a greater benefit from the provisions.
In this case, the players didn't want to go to sanction (they would really be a clear case of regulation), they wanted to choose more when they understood this.
They found a strategy decision, without a crime, or to flee before it.
Although the restrictions between the finding and the rules are disappeared, I believe that it is a clear case of finding.
I impressed that the polemic was followed by two factors: because it went to two self-key keys and because of the type of rule transmission.
The pain that has been added to the principles of the sport through these actions is less ethical than most ethically.
Advocate for customer starting for group-week Academys in Barcelona
The dictionary of the Calendar is allowed this year to fall a lawine of reservations on the 16 and 17 December.
The feeds paid by self-offs are broken, and you don't want to exceed 20 to 30 euros.
As Turrons and Friday lottery, there are also group-shots that bring to the Gast City and Free Time Concurrence of Barcelona, but, according to the economic crisis, they solve a price-official, to include the customer equipment that represents the great massage: if everyone wants to expose between 20 and 30 euros for a middle-day or evening, they ensure the requested companies and companies.
In order to be more complicated, the Calendar (Silvester falls on a free day) has fallen all terms in the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of reservations of lunch to two spent days (16 and 17.) and nearly no provisions in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad periods started, many companies have established the groups of budgets.
In order to not be contrary to this tradition, many employees pay them from their own board.
As the conjunction is still lacked, it will be required to below prices, confirmed by the President of the Gaietà Farras Gaietà Farras.
The representative of the Dachverband is not expected to prevent how the feastday will be viewed in this month.
"The people do not think it's ten times before they reserve."
"They want to go out, but they're looking strongly on the prices," he said.
The business will go well with those who "provide the quality of good prices with a good service," adds, and calls us to remember that the customers are saving in crisis times, because prices will be demanded for 25 euros.
In a consultation in various central restaurants, it appears that the night of 17 December the supplier leads to the collaps.
The Soteras Group says that the requests for this freedom with the view of less than 30 euros would be built. The group has applied their menus with complement offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjunction.
In another group, Andilana, which includes 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the property of the calendar, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the possibility to maintain the pre-year prices with menus for each challenge of 19,95 to 30 euros," explains he.
In the AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and total 23 locals, you do not lose the optimism after the second quarter was refrigerated and good, even at a few days concentrated views for the Wednesday business.
The sources of the enterprise group appeared that the 18th overactive day with friends who are former nights will be.
To the six group menus, a Friday menu has been added for 30 euros or more than pricehit. It has expressed that the customers are ready to expose more than 10 per cent in the previous year and want more details, such as Cava.
In some companys, you also see green spross playing, why the officers will be invited again. This provides the impression that groupnesses are again in the surrounding.
From the Dachverband Fecasarm (conclusions such as the Kneipen-, Restaurant- and Free-Time-band of Barcelona), Enric Gomà trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reserves are totally "live", although the customers "exclude a maximum."
However, the pleasure of the feast has not gone back, no one pays.
The Pakistan Nuclear Programme has great concern in the United States
Islamabad makes the atoms "speaker than any other country."
Wikileaks confirmed relations between Taliban and Pakistan.
The Internet Portal Wikileaks fulfilled the content of the Correspondency between the North American News in Pakistan and the United States Department confirms what great concerns the Pakistan Atom Programme Washington is prepared.
On the border of clear and safe detail, which offer the documents on the content of the conversation and the ideas of the accredited North American diplomates in Islamabad, these ensures that the cooperation between both countries in atomic security will not be strengthened, but that the instabil Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster ritmus than any other country."
Especially the own type of the Pakistan Atom Program - that the weapons are not combined, but their individuals are loaded in order to shoot their destruction in a possible attack - prepared for Washington sleeping nights.
The following risks numbers the messenger in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the old leader of the National Security Council, James Jones, says: "The nearly near some atoms at the Taliban attached areas, the reasonable disappearance of nuclear materials and the ability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of persons that are implied in the nuclear senale and the racket programmes will be considered not more than the United States, but also Russia as excessive and reasons to explore attention.
"Pakistan needs to set a serious faithful person to monitor the atoms; because of the low education and cultural levels, extremistic organizations have more opportunities to comply with atom or rakete programs," said the expert Yuri Corolev from Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American Offices.
The new documentation of Julian Assanges Internetportal is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is allowing nuclear distribution and the increased time in the Pakistan's nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the message described by the communication with Pakistan as "fruiting" states: "Therefore there is no transparency; we have no answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication Peter Lavoy, the employer of the State Secret Service for South Africa, confirms that "besides the economic catastrophe of Pakistan Atoms as fast as no other country produces."
The newspaper Patterson requests Washington during a visit of the highest soldier, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make the responsible "clare" that "Pakistan Armies have set his peaceful support to terrorist groups."
On the jagd to Wikileaks Chef
Obama calls a high responsibility for anti-terralism fighting for the prohibition of new entails.
Interpol provides a red warning to persecution and finding asylum.
All that connects with Wikileaks and his heroes, Julian Ashange, makes a complex labyrinth in which the contents are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday Interpol gave an "rote warning" to the "affination and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for the establishment.
Furthermore, she's not new, she's from 20 November.
She has nothing to do with the last completion of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual mistakes which the Australian should be in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
In the preparation on 20th, the International Police Authority with Sitting in Lyon (France) made the rule of Sweden, but it was not known until yesterday after the competence of the Sweden authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are indicated to identify and find "to determine and deliver it forward."
Although Interpol does not allow the establishment of one of a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning to be carried out by the organization, which must be carried out by the national police, especially if they are available on a bilateral expenditure agreement, as the case of Sweden and England is where it is possible.
The procedure encouraged Assanges' advocates who have been published a letter in which they reported that the 39-year-year causes of Wikileaks are ready to answer the questions of the Sweden authorities per video conference.
They also remember that Assange requested the expenditure from Sweden and from the State officer, which is compared to Lavrentiy Paulvich Beria, the Security Board of Stalin, which has received the appropriate approval.
"This is like a jagd, not as a legal persecution," is added in the write.
While the world seeks him - and his mother of Australia provokes the innocentness of his son - is ashamed in an unknown place, yet it is not hard.
On Monday, he gave the leader of the magazine Time by Skype from an unexpected place from an interview. He asked the return of the State Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"When it could be indicated that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomates to spending the UNO and that the international agreements signed by the United States, it should be returned."
His opinion was judged yesterday by the Press Secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who mentioned the request to return as "laugh and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN senter.
Obama himself has offered a high responsibility for anti-terralism war, Russell Travers, with the prohibition of new documents.
The intention of the President of the President Barack Obama to give less attention is to the opinions of the conservative policy and comments in these days.
The Congress Congress Peter King, who leads to the President in the National Security Committee of the Secretary-General, requested the State Department to examine the opportunity to put Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to propose their money and to follow everyone who supports or supports a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, President of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to call his opinion, Assange must be killed.
"Obama had to change him to a target box and to use a non-manting airport or something like that."
Who didn't apologize, was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, an ancient governor of Arkansas and the potential presidential candidate.
"Whoeverever has been who has given information in the government overseer, he is guilty of the Council, and everything that is not an adjustment is unclean to loud offence," he explained to the Sender Fox.
Puigcercós seeks with an eye winter for the Carod nearby peace in the ERC
The Republican Leader allows the Partie a secret vote on its continuous existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a pluralistic government and the end of the full-assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have a receipt to go from the road after the loss of 11 members and half of the ERC without control.
The Party-President is aware that his return rates are not sufficient to the nearby of the old party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Ruvira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is so weird as its mentor himself and not the same heads will be protected as other old struggles.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new criteria, which would ensure its position until the next community choices.
In the beginning yesterday, the ERC members of the ERC could be held secretly out of its remaining in the office.
With choices, not with high hand.
If the carodists wanted to adjust a crime scene to the President, they could do this without fear of repressal.
In fact, the chief wants to deny the instruction of columning and the subsignation under his person.
In several interviews, he strengthened that he would feel with half of the voices and one not confirmed, and he added without adding percentage values, a result of the "in the Bulgaria style" would not be good.
The Carod's neighbors ask the President more than only the party to provide its office, which is unreasonable because Puigcercos controls the Supreme Office of the Congress.
However, as they are not available for a sufficient majority to promote returns, they will agree with the state of a procedure plan from now to May.
They expect to ensure that the development of the document on strategic reorientation that the guideline will be presented to the Council on 18th vote.
Their view is to build for Puigcercos, and this promise is to prevent the congress in the 2011 herbs, which is already the party point for a fact.
The Party President of the ERC is the view that the "polyphony" pains the stability, and he is intending to bring the organization into the ability to watch their harmful wheels behind the closed doors.
In this sense, it is the article that the official conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
In view of Puigcercós is an ideal, the inhabitant of innovation was maintained to the fact that the Party President would be protected "in exhaustion against various goals".
He numbered five of those two standing in the front.
First, the "restructuring" of the situation, that this at least 90 percent of the parties members, is that the relationship of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should finally set up the full collection principle as functionality.
This means that he refuses a reform of the states that will be able to keep the convention with the selected delegated delegates.
From the end of the full collection model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is the Puigcercos team, who had already fighted on the last two congresses.
In fact, in the 2008 assembly, the participation was adopted with the check of the complementary principle on a convention that should be considered in the reform of the states.
This date is still out because the internal call of the last years was not ratified by this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the ground, the time may come to reach this matter and end forever.

China provides its goals to reduce the gas gas
The representative of China declared on the COP16, that his country has taken great efforts to reduce the coal products, and it would have maintained its offer until 2020 40 to 45 per cent of his gas gas.
China is to reduce the emission of gases to 2020 to 40 to 45 per cent, ensures Su Wei, representative of this country on the COP16.
In his first public approach on the 16th World Climate of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei had been ensuring that his country would have been a great effort to reach the coal products and to make its industry.
He expressed that in the past four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in order to reduce the emission of gas gas.
He explained that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategies in climate changes are divided in four aspects: dialogue, construction of capacity, construction of institutions and support of pilot programs.
In all aspects, they have progressed, including the agreement of a new energy system in the last year, which included the objectives in respect of the revoking of the emission of gas.
On the other hand, he showed that in China the authorities of the Contracting States had cooperated with those of the Central State and the communities to get the objectives for energy-parks to achieve effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
Moreover, there are already several years of plans in attack or concluded, as well as those financed by the Chinese Government, as well as those who received money from other countries.

Legal Exclusions Espinos: Cesar Nava
The National Leader of the PAN stated that the former panistic Party President had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to ask what the right to him is.
The National Leader of the PAN, Cesar Nava Vazquez, ensures that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former President of the PAN had the right to return to the National Order Commission and to request what the right to do to him.
In an interview, which was located as Governor of the Contracting State before the Conference of Gabino Cué Monteagudos, he explained that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision that was taken on local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonra."
"Mr. Espino has the right to turn to the Commission the orders of the National Council in his case, in order to adopt a decision from a competent position," added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not at the time of 2012 and that a allianship of the President's candidates has never seen at the negotiation.
Nava Vazquez was convinced that the National Action strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, when its followers were selected.
"This (a Allianz in 2012) is a subject that never was on the treatment, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the election of the community, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose."
The panistic leader explained that the PAN reviewed the 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not threaten us; in accordance with "We enjoy them and she strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would certainly choose the or the best President, the National Action for the next three years, and therefore he will overcome the staff "to those who will be determined by the Council."
"I'm totally inquired and open, I'd be honored to transfer each of the fifth of the party's office."
He prognoses that the surrounding of the parties signed in the last election of 4 July will be reflected in the next choices, although it is not at the time to think in 2012.
"Now it's why to support the Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he declared that the three governments that were originated from the Allians between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would take the favours and observe in the whole country, so they will be "a lot of hopes and prospects in them and I am sure that Gabino is on the height of the requirements."
When he was asked about the critical criteria of the PRI at the President Felipe Calderon, because of his discretion course in the framework of his four-year government, Cesar Nava called the PRI advisers to consider the six-year-year period of the ex-President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"When the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the Fox and Calderon, they should begin to protect them, they should finally come from the disease."
He is the viewer of the agreement governing expressions as those he could do in his discussions in Auditorio National, because in this country it doesn't give a vote or less a centurion.
Obama sets up in Twitter for the law the most undocumented students
"If you are for the agreement of the Dream Act - Acts, then call your Senators and drown to the agreement of this law," twittered the President of the United States in the favorite social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the countrywide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Laws to legitimate undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social Twitter network.
"If you are for the agreement of the Dream Act - Acts, then call your Senators and drown to the decrease of this law," twitter Obama.
His short communication contains a cyberlink to a higher document that requests publicity to contact with their senators, since the vote of the law is directly preferable.
"The time has come to listen to you in your voice," said he.
The message was extended after the 42 Republican Senators were broken, to block all votes for each law, except the extension of the assessment measures from Bush and the Government's financing would be extended.
A block that has been announced on a letter of the 42 Republic Senators could affect the vote of the Tream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the distribution of atoms.
On the block of the Republicans of the Law Tream Act and other projects, the President Robert Gibbs said that, when the draft theme is solved, a time plan could be established for the other projects.
"I think we have a lot of time."
"All we agree that the assets must be developed before the end of the year."
"I believe we can agree each time on this, and then we can plan the remnant of the rest," he said.
The President of the Democratic Mostness in Senat, Harry Reid, consented on the Sunday, to ask the vote to the conclusion of the debate, to make the Tream Act, with which the initiation to legitimate undocumented students from the next Sunday in the Senat could be declined, although the next week would be likely.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American dream would be legalized at about 800 000 young people entering into the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while the last five years had lived in this country and were referred to in a higher educational institution or armed.
However, the law's refugees need to ensure the initiative sixty voices, because they are approved to the voices of a manufacturer, and the organizations of the advocators of this project organize a intense influence on the law's agreement.
The democracies from which most of them support the Dream Act have more than 58 sites.
However, one of them, the Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, would vote to him, and only a republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the Protector of the Treaty Act must have several republianers on their side if other demokrates should decide to turn back to the initiative.
The most rebelled republicans are of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took the mandate of the Senator Mel Martinez.
Other republicans, supporting the Dream Act, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that it is not more supportable in another opportunity.
Another republian who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his maintenance.
Although the representative's house has another version, the analyticals agree with the Tream Act in the Senate before the largest restrictions.
Place the finger with literature
The second round of 'The Love in the language' was a spacious passage in which the participants made themselves strong for the statement.
"This is with the sex in the language I understand, but... the finger in the wheel? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle who feeded the Spanish literature and used the subtitles of their question (for a different construction of the runde table was confirmed to the sex in the language).
The finger in the wedding... "Bring us in difficulties," the argentinian writer tried to enter the public, which was mainly joined from young people who were gathered together on the International Books in Guadalajara (FIL) to participate in this Marisol Shultz moderate round table in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montro.
Louisa Valenzuela read a text that she stretched Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz then known as a great statement. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protogonists who are on the search to find what is a "wunde" and from the doctor to the doctor, from which they have no answer, but receives indications for the guidance of their statement.
The infectologist allows her to convince: "Pause is not my strength, maybe that's my weakness."
To conclude, after a frustrating approach to the triumphatologs, which you put in the middle of the attempt, and that you explain that the wedding is no scientist, the psychoanalytics deceived the secret: "The wedding is really open, the symbolic is the narbe."
The main figure of the statement makes it easier and concludes that it's "of the desire only found that this is really open and not existing." But it is convinced that the pleasure in the language and their cases are amazing.
Valenzuela, the literature systems, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramiírez also proposed an exciting statement that he called "Lob of the finding" and in which the finger is not mentioned, but it is detected.
With magic realism, he tells about a glorious sauberin, who retraced the clouds, reversed, or reversed by a girl lost tugend. The story reported a turn and reported from America, the Great Roman, which was not missing from the beginning of his own cronists, and he citated Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who crisized the overflow of the robbers' story.
"Cervantes, who included us all (the writer), spoke the predicted witnesses that were found in the story of the truth, but, in other way, the history of America would never be mentioned - with education power that even had been able to feel smooth."
However, he said, "If it's the fools and the liars who represent the things the best," and there's the reality and lies close to each other, where you don't know any more, to what side you hear, where the efficient literature is achieved.
He's actually called the "Tradition Cervantes".
"For him we have been here to be what will be told."
As Mayra Montero was at the row, he commented and praised the writers the multiple interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl to the round table 'The Finger in the woods'.
The Cubanian and Puertoricanine contributed to the great desire of the social violence that is like their country - as the whole Latin America - as the result of the fighting on drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poesia, good songs contain a silent, not precedingly planned commitment," she explained, after she had suggested that literature is communication and connection that is built between the author and the readers as a "chemical reaction".
On the evening, the Spanish leader Luis Garcia Montero, whose contribution also was "the finger of the inhabited literature in the wedding of the writer."
He noted that in a rapid world, the intellectual circumstances and the controls of the knowledge of knowledge to dogmatics will be forgotten, and it will be forgotten, "the following every confirmation is a little no, and after every disappointment is a little yes."
"In order to be in the possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuanci: and Nuanciers are often significant to put the fingers into the desire and to make those who feel very well when they think in the form of caricature, black and white, in preceding ideas without nuances, and also the powers that present the world to share in black and white, and he wanted to turn back to the mind of the letter.
Romano fights his first title
Ruben Omar Romano looked back on three deadlines in final games, he lived on and Abs in his carriers, but three times he played a lot of games.
In the Duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles of their own trainers, and the events that are identified by the accommodations are reflected in the results.
Ruben Omar Romano looked back to three low-downs in final games, he lived on and Abs in his carriage, but three times he had a solvent game, and he has been well maintained, because this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentina has played up with the medaille to the second champion, he is a step behind the guests, and he is surprisingly raised up with the same team end games.
The sanitary strategy has reached the first final game as trainer during 'Torneo openture 2002', as the depart of Morelia had the cycles in hand with which he found a great delay against Toluca with 4-2; afterward, when 'Clausura 2003' he got the decision dull, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
For preparation with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', when they played against Los Diablos, Ruben had to reach a back, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was disappeared from 210 minutes after 210 games, but when he arrived with 3-1, he got two possibilities to insert his title, but less than three of his players had lost the eleven steps and the game went to a 4-3.
Ruben had already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with his big rivals, lost. So he would not be persecuted again from the wrong and freed himself from the bad cyber to first celebrate a title, although he strengthened that the most important game is for him.
"I want to be Champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my neighborhood, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important," commented the officer when you asked him about the lost end games.
The last game is still strong to stay in the memory, he assured that he learned much of it: "The only teaching we can get out is that until the guard is not finished, we can't feed, we are prepared at the line, the players also, because the last time we were prepared with two thousand meters to separate it, and I think it's a teacher until the game is done, there's no advice to feed."
To know that this series may be resolved by elf meter shoes, it doesn't humble him because he trusts his players: "Man never wants to come at the eighth steel, you want to stop in the regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but I'm sorry to prepare a bad game, sometimes after Nervocity or the heavy trial, which has already left us something for this game, and we hope that it's not going to come."
It is in Romanso's power to be not only a second champion and first to cost the glory that the title brings with itself.
The United States changes the rules for the maintenance of a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation during the consulat in the services for visa request; the costs will be so expired.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures to request a visa are amended in the report of the United States and in the consumers.
In the new procedure, most applicants have to be presented before their conversation in the context of the services for visa demand (ASC, initial books on English).
The person of the ASC takes the biometric data of the applicant that will be checked by the Consulat before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirators to calculate:
The total costs for the development of the visa, since it is no longer required to pay a payment of the period, the processing of the visa procedure and the transport service with which the document is applied.
The applicant provides only one payment that covers the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: $140 for a tourist visum, $150 for Visa with request (including Visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to long their visibility should not be discussed in the Consulat, they should only imagine the next ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are included in the ASC, the applicants who require a second date for the conversation in the console are less than the previous.
Those who request the visum in the console of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo have no longer payment for 26 dollars.
Additional information about the new visa request procedure may be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visa-FAQs.html
NASA reports the fund foreign life
The North America's Spanish Department has received a press conference to present a fund that will have the effects on the search of lives in all.
The National Air and Room Authority (NASA) of the United States offers tomorrow, Sunday, astrobiological detection that can ensure the theory of the existence of external life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference in the NASA in Washington of experts of the astrobiology, and it is a science that investigates the origin, the development, the distribution and the future of life in the universe.
When the Press Conference was introduced, the NASA ensures that it will be "a surprising fund for searching for external life" which the specializations were solved in experts with other countries.
The deterioration may indicate that it can exist human similar creatures in the enemies that have been maintained for inhabitable environments. It was the hypothesis that these are in intelligent lives - as humans - could change if they improve their life conditions.
It seems to be a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the National Park of Yosemite, California. She lives there in a environment that has been maintained for all natural life forms, because the sea is strongly arsenous.
In some kind of way, the microbi uses the arsen as a survival resource. In consideration of this ability, the possibilities that it may be a similar life on other planets that are not available on our protective atmospheres.
If these organisms change the substance, according to the astrobiologists, it is indicated that "it actually exists a different form of life, a second form of life that is different from us."
The room office is known tomorrow on the Sunday, on the Press Conference, the real reward of its funds.
At the Conference, the geobiologist Pamela Conrad participate in the possibility of life on Mars, and the Biology Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the greatest month Saturns), is studying whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.

With this reform, they repeatedly would introduce a "due party system" because now there would be two people who were the same number of parties controlled by the Congress.
These four delegates, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only presidency of Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca in his property as representative of the President.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the Parties of PRI and PAN were institutionally introduced their political adjustment with these reforms.

"Before I come here (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we will be excluded from all the decisions that will not take back on the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that it was a pluralist group of agreements with PRD, PT and Patrons.
It could not be allowed, he continued that the congress after he was monopolistic, now should be duopolistic.
"It's not the spirit of the law reform that in the Congress, an eternal two-party system should rule."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five delegations and they speak with other colleagues and colleagues to be more," explained the Convergence Middleman.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led to play at PAN and PRI that the congress has now changed in a "beat" for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they share this to two."
Patron Montalvo requested to respect the reporters and to assign them their place to the negotiations.
"The five who are currently assembled as in various groups have decided to join themselves to take our place in the negotiation, because because the reform that has been conducted and broken by others is reached outside and we are not understood with this reform."

Touristic places must be improved
Touristic companies deploy the accident of the foreign tourists according to the bad state of Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the study of a foreign tourist in the breach of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the touristic branch of Mazatlan was requested to the authorities, the areas that are in a bad state and bring a bad image to the Haven City to give special attention.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the employee of the Zona Dorada, reminded that various opportunities were required to establish the river target and the worst conditions that the tourists are present to transform in new employment opportunities or roads.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the streets would have affected negatively because the tourists came to the worst and saw the disorder, in which they would apply the near near bottoms.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't think how much money you lose, because they wouldn't do the building works in this way long and planned."
The hotel officer José Ramon Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist student had noticed the missing prevention and the remaining staff work outside the city.
"The community must take their responsibility and deny that happens again. How should it do? Now, by a precisive maintenance, instead of to improve everything in the behindnee," he explained.
"We are expected to have a sad city, not only because it works for a foreign transport area, they must be held, and we have a right to a serious lifespace. The city management must change their strategy to maintain the city in a good state."
"There are other places that are also incompatible and incompatible," he said, "e.g. el Escudo and el Venadito of Mazatlan."
"Today, we need more than only publication to lock tourists. It must be commanded a good product, a city that keeps their streets and streets smooth, and the tourist tractions always in shoes," he concluded.
"There are not sufficient attention and these types of cases show the only thing that is manifest for all: a conscience is essential."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretor of Promotion Turistic, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlan, because they would not be right to use and put a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought together to the city to the president, and the city should be pregnant for the foreign transport.
"Blessed is Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural towns that first have to be purified and cleaned to make them attractive for the foreign transport and to bring them to the inventor with which we are going to go for this river.
IP requests results from the Congress
Eduardo Dàvalos, President of the CCE, suggested that the Parliaments should take the great responsibility for a better Sinaloa, which is before many requirements.
The Mazatlan's enterprise requires a serious parliament, free of discussions moves to the parties and the government, since Sinaloa is excited and has been raised before great problems.
It has been included in the 60th Parliament. It is sitting out of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence, and one of the PVEM together. This makes a total 40 people representative.
The new members of the State Congress are expected that they do a serious work, feel the society and the different society groups that are assigned to a responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same pattern of partiality and patriarchism.
Eduardo Dovalos, Chairman of the CECE Coordination Council, suggested that the new Parliaments should take the great responsibility for a better Sinaloa, which is before many requirements.
"We hope that the Secretary-General really make their right to take free of discussion between the parties, because it is usually that they take agreements with their own interests in which they change in carneval companies of the governors and the leaders of the Parliamentary Fractions."
He said that they should show their commitment to the establishment of the needed briefs to support the current government.
"We're concerned that they're doing a confidential work and apply to all things for the society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa, who talked to them in the last choices."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Hotel Conference of Tris Islas, means one of the great requirements with which the 40 people representatives are the operation and the common work for the economic growth of the State, because today the economic situation is most complicated.
"The most important is that they take the economic growth, create investment resources and infrastructure measures, which will promote the design of workplaces."
In regard to the Foreign Trade Bank, he requested the new Member States to promote the Foreign Transport Ministry to participate the required positions in the State budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two-weightest Mediterranean, which is incompatible with an important economic agency that brings devises and investments into the country and is in direct competition to the agricultural industry."
The tourist projects must be assigned to the money that the State Security must be supported and the alcohol health that has not been re-established in previous legislation periods must be brought to the new position.
Holy King is searching
Puppes, cars, vehicles and other games want the children of Coronado Valenzuela's family.
For parents, it will be difficult for the next three-year-old day to fulfil these desires, because the budget is no longer and not less than twelve persons and a cycle.
Nevertheless, Adeleida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel don't give the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the game and the clothes that they say so.
The family lives in a great house in the apartment of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father doesn't have a fixed job.
"It's sometimes because my husband doesn't have a job, but we're sold Mandarin and Cartofels... I'm going with the Green to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
The four-year-old Adeleida would like a puppet or a travelway, while their three-year sister Isabel wanted a barbie puppet.
The ten - year - old Joseph Alfredo wants to have a "month car" since some time, and for those eight months old brothers Jesus puts Cayetanna clothing in the size of a year old.
"(Jose Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let us wait, boy, 'cause it was very poor," remembered Cayetana threatened.
For the older children who were in school would be ideal clothes and shoes.
The 11-year-old Maria Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah is the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan missed tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help the dreams of the children of Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign 'The Health King' by sending a player or bargeld in the reception of the New York Times.
14 Must Drug Agency arrested
On Middle Wednesday, in the framework of a production and vending network of Cannabis for the ten household investigations in the administrative region.
Four-four persons were arrested and various accusations were made.
The household investigations were played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the positions should be attached before the production of drugs.
"Before 750 cannabis plants, four kilo Kilo Haschisch, Bargeld and equipment that have received the production are confected," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec's security policy speaker.

These household investigations have been found in the consequence of a long-term examination entirety that has been exposed for a year.
"The information received from public hand has allowed us to carry out these festivals," Mr Ruel proposed.
In order to participate in the 70 policies of the Regional Agency Agency Strain of the Security Police of Quebec, Sherbrooke and the Police Authority Memphremagog in this policy operation.
The secret advertising could be followed without problem.
The law design of conservatives that the Government should regulate the problem of the ships loaded with secret advocates will be taken into account after the three opposition parties have noticed that they can not approve the proposal.
"I'm lying with expression against this charta."
"I'm holding a party that has put you feet at the feet," said Michael Ignatiff, leader of Liberales, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the collected department.
The Liberals believed that the law design, which allows each one of the ships identified by one of the ships to be identified to transport of illegal people, to a year, would be disappointed as proposed by the Canadian legislation and freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, chief of the Bloc Quebecois, also declared that the law design could not be able to support because he turned to the false target group.
"We are inclined, and it seems that all the opposition parties are along, so we will wait for what the Government takes," said Mr Duceppe.
The criteria on the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the criteria from the hand that required their party was not sufficiently satisfied with the secret advisers.
"The Neo Democratics have perceived that they have taken measures against the blind passions, and also we are trying to continue through the transmission of another law design, the C-35,," said Chow.
We are not surprising the law design of the Conservatives because he seeks the crime in the flights and the children hold at least a year in prison," said Chow.
Mr Jason Kenny accused the opposition parties to play with the policy and ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians share the Secretary-General, in particular, that they do not tolerate this kind of secret income, these criminal actions relating to Canada and treat the country as a foot-department."
"There are expected that Canada takes severe measures", so the Minister Kennys reactions.
"The Government has not announced any confidentiality on its law design that could lead the country to choices that the government would have denied.
However, a conservator has expressed the QMI agent that the Government would call a vote to explain any opposition delegation immediately against his choices.
The new unit does not find a single unit
Instead of announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion since Jean Charest requires many supervisors to continue to education of a public research committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, meaning that this idea is not last: Quebec had already consulted the New Yorker Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropol is available since 1870 on a standing unit against corruption.
However, the advice of lunch has more than one surprise.
It is necessary to say that this measure, at least the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebecer Police Service on 29 October, unless the presence Robert Dutils had been discussed at the minimum.
It is also not that Stephane Bergeron, Critical and Member of the Partie Quebecois, this advice in the public security point as "of the hut-beavered hair" and "the solution established in a table" is qualified.
The Ministry Dutil had returned again to those who feared that the political power has been too much influenced on the infrared, future units.
"They will see the result when we are telling it," he began to strengthen himself.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public question.
"I'll stop Mr. Charest to prevent the education of this research committee, which will be more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to make a research committee is the return of Jean Charest", explained by Yves Boisvert, dozens for Ethics and Political Systems in the ENA (State High School for High Management Education).
In order to get out of this sack gas, he proposes the Quebec to introduce the financial checking a specific mandate to make these researchs relating to corruption and secret debates.
"Man should be able to enhance the mandate of the checking control," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec of the checking controls could include the same power as the Commissioners, which would also allow you to commit to the people to exhibition.
The education of an existing unit is not the only project in the shipping of the Government of Charest.
The Quebec is also requested by Ottawa to change the crime in order to be better set on this kind of crime.
This question is from the Governor of the Operation Marteau, who has informed the Justice Ministry Jean-Marc Fournier that the legal speaking in this type of crime is not clear.
Vic Toews, the Ministry of Public Security, confirmed his colleague from justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment with certain, this folder related notifications.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, the groups of motor raid policys were arrested 131 persons, although the crime was not cleaned.
Ottawa has followed the law against Gangsterum.

Adjust Dupont to Part
The Quebecer Round function moderator Stephane Dupon has made the Canadian Surveillance Council for Round Functional Normes (CCNR) in accordance with its comprehensive expressions on social forces and haitians as well as because of his randomly reports on the Funk.
The CCNR points to the opinion, Mr. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM team, however, had the right to their own opinion, "no information on social services and inappropriate negative statements of the Haitians and also contained an impropriate inhabited statement that is not approved to the day-out-extracted sentences".
The Surveillance Council also concluded that a discussion on self-sex that contains the names of two persons who have been achieved by self-sex against the codex of the round transmission.
The CCNR had received several reports on the comments issued during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first disposal was inserted in accordance with a statement of the "Common Front of the Social Assistance of Quebec".
The active organization was considered that the imports referred to in the sentence were not worthy.
Moderators should share more solid than unreducing events.
According to the subject of self-sexternal murder, Moderator Stephane Dupon had the opinion that self-sexpression was a expression of favour.
The majority of the supervisory members had concluded that the transmitted message was that self-sexistence could not be considered as a solution of living crisis.
"The majority of the Surveillance Council notes that the negative consequences of the sending "Dupon le Midi" had a reciprocal subject in a family-better and nice way."
That is why he had no taxes against his person.
The last battle point occurred to the exhibitions in Haiti.
Stephane Dupon and Jean-René Duptually had given a medium-effective conversation that a lot of reactions had produced.
The CHOI moderator declared that it was not the benefit of Haiti's help, because you didn't know with security if the needs would actually get the money.
The Surveillance Council is the view that these comments were not misbreaking characters, however, that their cumulative effects were an inadequate negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already broken my three-day supply trap in this case."
"It's my act since a half years of juvenile," explained the moderator.
In all decisions, the Advisory Council provides the broadcast of an unobtained expression.
In all cases, the CHOI FM running functioner has been treated "instead of its obligations".
The consequences for the running functioner, which, in other words, should have notified its decisions at the time of the main end within a period of three days, are less.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Naceredine Zemmal, Montrealer Algerian origins, has entered a very special course.
The athlet in "Sanda" (Full Contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxes and in Thaiboxs, now is in search of new needs on the Tatami and in the boxes of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algerian with fight ports such as Kung-fu and Kickboxes," explained the term that has been along with the metropole since 2008 to continue developing under the profile.
I'm personally looking for the fight of all the surgery, because for those who represent the ground fight, as the missed officers, do not want to fight in North America."
Currently, his signs were working as a security officer, and the UPS company had made the bad news in which he was achieved between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, the World Mastership of Amatheure two Gold Medailles from the World Carate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
"I have made the winner in the category of the full contact of Kickbox and the Taibox," he explained.
"I'm ready for the world pool in San Shou in China."
"The fighters were invited from every category who had placed themselves in the last world community among the first four."
"I got baby 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"I've been back in Vietnam in 2005."
"2007 I finished the Turner in China on the fifth place, while I became in Toronto Third in 2009," he added.
"I'm not surprised that I have progressed in each concurrence."
"I will be the first time or the next year."
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are strict disciplines from China, which are allowed to be cutting and feet traits as well as the ground circles.
The two fights are usually played on a platform, rather in a boxing.
The most renamed box fighter who has gone out of this kind of battle port is the American vietnamian origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of the fighters.
If Nacer Zemmal remains only one event in his carriers, he would be named here with security his presence in the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"The concurrency war is the highest and most viewed in China," explained the sympatic poundskerl.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the Lumpine Station (the largest Stadium Thailands)."
"This was a great experience."
He had won his first battle in the half end of his category (80kg) before he died in the end.
"The one who raised me was a profile," he analyzed.
"There are four assistants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The guests of the half-final will always meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the guests of every category offered the stress to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without exhibition
Hydro-Quebec, in contrast, project planning firms, has approved 450 million dollars to contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcel route.
In the middle of more than 100 contracts, there is a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has received the most important part of the project leadership, to a total of 295 million dollars without expression.
This consortium, named "Energy gestance", was made as a combination of the decision of Hydro-Quebec, the private sector, to transmit this important, hydroelectric project in a sum of $5 billion.
In the beginning of 2005, the Consortium "Energy guerance" increased the Lucrative Treaty without a public statement.
The Partie Quebecois provides a serious ethical problem that ensures the risk of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new type and way of a carded game and consistent with competition."
"This means that you are carried out games instead of the secret type and way now in open form," explained yesterday Sylvain Simard, representative of the PQ, on the press conference.
At the last day, Simard had asked the question before the National Conference, because it seems to be hard to understand how the interest of the public can be subject to this kind and way.
The Ministry of Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had reacted on the afternoon, intended that it had been treated in this Treaty for a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she cried, strengthening the PQ has been "increasingly" and it's "from you."
She said it's "be the less," that the PQ was sorry.
The model of the consortium is a worldwide practice.
It is usually a periodically satisfied employment that allows two or more companies to interpret their experts in accordance with a command on an explanation for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" shows a high-complexity level on its work.
The construction procedure shall be established and shall be established until 2012.
The Treaty was also forgiven without finding a competition fight; it has already been given negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself does not make any exception for relatively simple projects.
As the magazine "Le Devoir" mentioned last week, it is the model used in the field of the consortium consortium area of government media.
A short overflowing of the Quebecer Company Register allows more than 200 consorts to appear from some of the competent duration.
For example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the most of their nuclear competitors, with which CIMA+, Genivar, SNC lavaline or roche and Tecsult, together.
Each link, and there are several thousands, brings back one and the same jurisdiction, in fact to Dessau.
What the Consortium "Energy gérance" is, the Ministry Normandeau states that "the territory of Baie James has been submitted a special working dynamic and that Hydro-Quebec has been fulfilled since the 70s of the years in particular."
Real Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'energy de la Baie James (SEBJ), has submitted a statement that the Nase has rejected the fact that the Treaty on the draft management was approved to the convention.
"If you make a statement and there's only a few competitors, your prices will be fast."
"So you have two opportunities: or you take the people who are on this march and tell you, it will be a joyful accommodation to a good price."
"The thought is, however, that the price is not decisive, but the fact of the persons," confirmed the laptop.
This contract intended to the Consortium "Energy guerance" is a part of a long list of contracts over 50,000 of the Partie Quebecois.
The contracts were approved by the Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcel Rupiter.
After checking, the journal "Le Devoir" was added to more than 100 engineers and consultors contracts, companies or files, including resource laboratory, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC Lavalin was 22 contracts, Genivar had 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without calculating their participation to "Energy assurance".
All these contracts are treated.
They entered a total of $449 783 344, including the Treaty with "Energy Garance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had allowed the four companies that make the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "party Liberal du Quebec well known".
The Ministry Normandeau had given an advice that the PQ would be connected to the companies that they were "financing" before she predicted that it was more about their leadership forces.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "grone" label is not trusted
Green, but single sceptic.
The Quebecer consumption has little confidence in the main factors of the sustainable growth, but also less to the characterised marks or the eco identifications to maintain its choice.
The shame, although it is in a medium-effective universe, where it is only so weird by the information offered by a responsible consumption only: the barometer responsible consumption has been able to achieve a manner of faithful information, an unlawfulness that makes himself known as bremse of his commitments, as the first reading was held yesterday.
Although they have prevented the consumption of such social products in 2010, the Quebecer seems to make a little credit.
Two third parts of the Quebecer population are to give the environmental agement of the companies as well as the green business exploitation, so it is distributed by the responsible consumer centre of Sherbrooke University.
Another review: the half of consumers doubts the confidence of the official certificates, which are increasingly added to good products, but also the credibility of products and marks that declare themselves as environmental environment, as well as the barometer.
On the same pattern, the political discussion on this subject is only 14,6% of the Quebecer population.
The information regarding responsible consumption seems likely important to stimulate this consumption section, which is currently increasingly only one third of the chequezer consumers.
In fact, the 46% of the consumption was deemed to debt empty and doubtful characteristics of the information.
This is, after the higher price of the products, the second, since the barometer identified.
Furthermore, a third part of the Quebecer of the given delivery capacity of green products and services that you are trying to put them on their hands is incredible.
According to another communication, it has already changed the half of the consumers in 2010 and, in particular, changed the mark of one or more products to give their confidential expression.
By barometers, they also prevented to 61% investment in hands of their town rooms and rewarded foods built in their region.
Green and responsible employees - the environmental consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the human consumption of Quebec loves to present himself as King of Recycling, who trys to reduce his spectrums left in the environment, taking care of the animal protection.
However, the social and ecological knowledge seems to keep before his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer has indicated to use public transport equipment in 2010 or have prefered to demonstrate its environmental interests.
The accession and the travel procedures have also been encouraging from 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive treatment, which eat the clinical proposals.
State direction for the eXcentris to take
The Quebecer Government, requested by the Société Angus and the Company Parallelele to participate financially in the transfer of the kino-complex eXcentris, is explained to a cooperation, but only in the form of a competition.
The developer company Angus and the Parallellele company, which had been raised up a speed of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Cultus for the transfer of Daniel Langlois, had not obtained publicly what they required.
However, the Government has agreed to participate in this matter, however, in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected speed, the Quebecer Government provides a length in less than the initially expected height that could call for a existing potential solution in life, at least after the consideration of the sources taken from the State law.
A first action plan and a request for 12,8 million have already been rejected from Quebec last birthday, since the bitt trial was reiterated fully lowly.
A proposal has already been sent by the President of the "Société de development of the cultural business" (SODEC), Francois Macerola, a Minister of St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago, he had given her a last case report.
However, the proposal of the Cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on the middle of the Mediterranean.
Parallel and angus are now until 31 December to answer them.
It seems that the prices of the State Sender are really threatened to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebecer owner community of Kinos and Kinocomplex has rejected a direct state investment to support the eXcentris' support, while they have made the argument, the Ministry of Kultus has no financial assistance for immobiliating projects which he has also not allowed other kinosols.
However, several other market participants of the Segment have been attached to the sustainable, economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, after the own funded construction of Kinos for ten years, presented the authorkino in the rooms of his kino-complex, which could justify the exception since the cost of the State.
The missing of kinosballs showing independent films is more visible in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his client at the stage.
The Société Angus and the Parallelele company with Christian Yaccarini at the spitze, stealing a private financed campaign from which they hope a sum of $7000,000 to buy the construction.
Since March 2009, only one lending will continue to show movies in eXcentris, including Le Parallèle.
The target of the future producer is to open three kinosels on February 27, next year, with the implementation of the very balanced film of Xavier Beauvois "The men et the dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini has not called the magazine "Le Devoir" and ignored what he and his group keeps from the corrected proposals that you have done to them.
The secret of the complex protected Canadian
The new American diplomatic leaderships that were expanded by WikiLeaks were declared the secret of what the United Nations discovered under the minority complexity of the Canadians against the Americans, but with the same threat, they opened the feeling of overcome against Canada.
According to the American diplomates, the Canadian electorers have not had the Canadian American relations in the meaning, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to continue their budget of 2009!
The four new communications between the American news in Ottawa and Washington, which were published yesterday, offer more painting details than the only substance content where you have to snow.
A connection of 22 September 2008, e.g. in the period where the federal election campaign was in full way, reports on which point the United Nations will not participate in the institutions discussed by their political bodies.
For the great extents of David Wilkins, which was used in Ottawa, American messengers.
Mr. Wilkins provides various statements.
"A Canadians, nearly inhabiting minority complex, may be considered the Canadian, Political Leadership forces to speak more about the internal military issues of the whole day as the United States to move the black Peter (as in 1988 on the campaign on the free trade)," describes it.
The United Nations, as he decided, are therefore "the speaking Goliath of this choice: all-present, but potential to speak about him."
The newspaper understands these "increasing silence" less because the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "the ability of a candidate, party, and more than a party to make a such essential relationship that the electoral has a key factor in the meaning."
The second expression of this feeling of significant feeling is reading on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, employee in Ottawa, sended communication that President Barack Obama should prepare for the first visit in Ottawa.
"Your travel will be helped to ensure the further existence of the Government at the Confederate Agreement on the Budget House on the beginning of February, which will be recognized by the first deficit in Canada after more than a decade, which has been achieved in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars.
He had not mentioned that the Government had to prevent the Parliament's meeting before Wednesday to prevent that the Parliament would throw out from the coalition and that would continue to continue to affect the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed balance programme.
An additional communication from January 2008 from the reporter Wilkins, Washington understood from the negative image that the dramatic series of the United States are extended by the CBC.
The newspaper is urgent of sendings such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can watch a little subtile playing at Maher Arar, "no-Fly-List" or also executions for the purpose of the CIA's muscle protest.
Another communication reports out of the way Hillary Clinten in their French office colleagues Bernard Kouchner asked whether Europe is ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should answer the question with yes, however, on the basis of a individual "fall in case".
At the end of the meeting, it is described, "If the Secretary-General described a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-year-old Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the act."
Finally, we still notice that the smokers are achieved on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an older and Stephen Harper, had explained about CBC that the responsible for this massive leck should be "transmitted".
He had refered to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
World wide plan to renew the light
The UNO has proposed yesterday a plan to renew households, trade and industry in 100 countries in respect of the reaching a reduction of the gas (FCKW), which nearly agrees to a third part of the additional reduction, which must be implemented to stabilise the ground climate to 2020.
This ambitional plan takes its position in the steps of specific large projects that are expected to implement the UNO in Cancun to compense the absence of the low reduction obligations of industry countries.
Following the last plan, the main problem would be reduced in form of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW FCWs, which have been carried out on the ground, if the white glass beasts, which have become a monopol of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluoressional or better, by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the gas of the worldwide flow park.
In Copenhagen last year, the large absences such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, were committed to free reduction plans that should cut down the global FCKW emissions of 53 GT to 49 GT.
However, from this balance, we needed to leave 5 Gt to stabilize climate steps from today to 2020 to 2 degrees Celsius to prevent that this is not controlling.
95% of the energy in the white flashed birds, and the rest of 5% produces the light.
With the compact lighter beach, the energy consumption is reduced to 75%, with the new LED glass branches, this energy needs again for the double.
The compound lighter belongs in the snippet between 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED-fellowships, such as those who carried the manufacturer Philips this week on the market - this society has continued to participate in UNO study - have been expected of 25,000 hours and consumed 80% less energy than a white smoking birne, which provides an adjustment of the possibilities of the exchange plan that will be used in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that some entirely new luxury breasts are only very small, they can also work with a rule.
And they don't contain any cheek silver.
Many specialists have shown that compound lighter reserves because they contain cook silver and that you need to resolve them as special fulfillment, which is not always possible in developing countries, except the products are available.
However, the main source of Quecksyl remissions on the planet does not give the compact lightbirne, but mostly the coal capacity works that are essentially exhausted more quick silver to create the electricity consumed by the white smoking birds.
Only in the United States, these cool power works have been explored by 25,000 tons of Quecks Silver each year.
The report describes the wine that each country would make through this international programme.
Indonesia would, for example, assume a billion of dollars per year at the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal capacity work which would cost 2.5 billion in India.
Earlier currency expects the advertising of the results of the currency
The UNO General Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the "incompatible" publication of the results of the eleven office of the eleven offices directly following their fresh table.
"The Secretary-General understood the need of the independent election committee to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without further advancement," stated an UNO Chef previewer.
"He requests all parties and institutions of the eleven office to put their responsibility under evidence and to maintain each initiative until the proclaiming of the proper results."
Instead of the seventh of certain foreign governments, the election Commission had laid the Deadline on the middle-night, three days after the election on the Sunday, without publication of the results.
Circa forty minutes ago, the President of the CEI had confirmed that the Commission would "continue with the work" to report the results.
On the midnight, the CEI has been called a lot of calls from the whole world, but the CEI can finally call the name of the leader of the second choice border under the Laurent Gbagbo separated from the office and its representatives Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo loader reviews the annulation of "beaugerical" Stimmabgaven in the northern by the Review Council, which has been obtained by the ex-rebellioner of the Forces news (FN) during the missing putsches in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of the President campaign of the eleven office, confirmed that the FN's practical Manufacturers in order to protect the choices in the northern country the advice of the President had to go to the election.
The whole choice may be cancelled if it is considered to be considered by Gbagbo's Review Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more considering that the highest Court of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dré, a political attachment to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the Northern, who turns all connections to the ex-rebels, has declared the delay in the statement of the currency results as "unanimable" and requested Gbagbo to respect these, even if he has not been so long to demand the guidance.
His employment partners force Gbagbo to block the publication of the results, as he knows that he has lost; and a question before the Court of Justice, after the election committee has left the election to publish the results, is illegal.
The second rounds of the President's elections on Sunday were maintained for the ruling of the Union and Reunition process of a country who had been placed in two parts for years.
The United Nations had warned the policies of the eleven officers on the middle of the United Nations that they could be held responsible for these excuses.
Laurent Gbagbo, the first election ratio on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% of the Alassane Ouattara, which had used the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round) as a Spitzenkandidat.
Workless cost in France remain stabil in the third quarter

Alexandre Guerini arrested and arrested
According to Alexandre Guerini, 53, leader of an investigation company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhone (PS), he was introduced a remediation procedure and was entered into the prison in Luynes near Aix and Provence.

Mr Guerini, brother of Jean-Noël Guerini, the first man of the PS (parti socialist) in the department, had the value to allow the judge before his audience through his lawsman a memoraum to his right-life.
A partner Guerinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also arrested and arrested at the middle-second.

With regard to the business competence area or the destination of the fund that he had never had known, so Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, ancient General Director of the Public Service of Aubagne, on the middle of the debate and compliance, has been approved, but then, under the design, to keep himself in a judicial care of the protestants of these acts, on the free feet.
"My Mandant could give explanations to the facts that had been suggested to him."

Affair Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée-Palast overrides its middle function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the shiproom of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, held in Iran because of "Spionage", the French public in Atem, transmitted the diplomacy in alarm preparation and accented the distortion of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the wonderful views of the diplomates of the United States.
The U.S. documents received by WikiLeaks and through the journal "Le Monde" gives some backgrounds of this crisis price.
They describe how Elisée explained to Americans his strategies, which were going to give these advice on their own crisis in Iran (a small group of Wanderers).
They show how the French responsibilities have tried to convince Washington that the freedom of young French is not the freedom of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France, and by the American justice, because of trade with materials, which have been achieved by the Iranian Nuclear Programme.
Finally, they set the type and way that the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to the purpose to make the idea faithful that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss in a green light.
In fact, he did nothing in this regard.
On 12 August 2009, the diplomatic telegram edited in Paris brings the title "Iran: French comments on the type and way of the transition with gessels."
François Richier, Elysée-Bereter in strategic issues, was involved in association with Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American Diplomatin Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her the French method.
They invited the Americans to set everything in order to reduce their own country members who would have been strongly held in Iran.
"Might dream," they said, "articulated sound and clearly and without sublation" the words "mentional rights", "I'm sorry", "fortunate freedom" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iran regime in a possibility that is very exciting to his image.
"Don't make it more than the Iranians ask you to do that."
Because "Still swallows nothing," the discussion tries on an accidental way, the Iranians are "Masters in exchange".
Mr. Richier adds that the festival of foreign countries is a "credibly, Iranian taktic" as "association to the purpose of political expression".
He notes that the freedom of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (the state of 16 August should come on the day when they fled in the French message) "requests the payment of a great money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro Kaution).
And he can suffer that Elisée's anti-cipes, another phenomenon that's "they's gonna be smoking."
The Iranians could "in the near future beyond 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released twelve days ago from the prison, however, it will continue to be held in Iran.
A information was carried out in the circuit: the Iran Majid Kakavand, which the United States delivered by illegal trades with an increasing electronic material to the Iran, has been released after a judge in Paris from the prison.
The American message is how many other supervisors, questions about these surprising coinsidency.
For Washington, which persecutes the illegal Irish networks of the construction of the nuclear programme, the freedom of Majid Khakavand provides a bad news.
Did France take a cooking trade in buy?
The freedom of the Iranian against the French?
Instead of a renewed subtraction with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Francois Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, thus he says, wasn't just "increasingly surprised by the decision of the judge," but I also tried to deal with it.
"It has given a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Ministry" (at the time Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the legal decision," explains.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the "strenger" observation of the French secret service.
The Elysée Berater chooses a phone number, repeatedly, reports the American diplomatin, the Iranian, "the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris."
During the Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisée has no longer been able to believe his efforts, by means of disagreements and by the media organized "flight tests", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influssive media role".
The Americans not observed this activities without the Ironian and constated that manipulation brings fruit, because several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram of 25 August 2009 describes "the media position of the French authorities".
What is so based on "Thanks" against Mr. Assad, the Party's message is asked.
"Trough their statements of full loving prices, the French authorities ensures that they have only aware of what the Syrians really have done."
The document will then be considered the reasons that the Elisée has brought to disappear this function.
The intensive communication efforts "the Sarkozy's policy to ensure the opening against Syria" analyses.
A 2008-based policy, which was then "for several critical votes in France and in the outland as freaking and unvaluable."
"The Syrian role is built" trying to lead Paris "Syrian before the eyes that you can achieve the balbuilding by playing a construction role in the region."
It is also the objective to seize the difference between Syria and Iran.
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier told her, "It is sure we don't know if the Syrians have always done whatever."
"But we have thanked us all with them."
"This should be at least disagreement with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her in Elysée.
In a community, he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role of freedom of our countryman."
No online games for young Koreans north
The South Korean Government will be a law called "the Aschen bread", which will be prohibited to the young people to play after the North Online Games by locking them the access, so the deuted government's responsibility.
A law design that will request the online game drivers to refuse young people from 16 years after midnight to access these games will be presented to the Parliament in December, the violated representatives of Kultus and family ministers.
"More children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life over day."
"We are thinking that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with the trusted Ministerial Representative of the French Presidency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be re-accessible from 6:00 tomorrow.
The manufacturers had a year long time to prepare for the implementation of the law, so he predicted.
The Government also makes it in the eye to ask the manufacturers that the time limit for access to these games the young ones who ask for parents added the responsibility.
He will also make the persons who want to provide free software that can limit the internet time.
South Korea is one of the most "network" countries, and the journals are regularly reported by different events, with intense Internet use.
The country is also an unemployed Champion in the world-wide online Game competition.
In November, 58 other nations were broken in the World Cyber Games in the World Cyber Games.
World Mastership 2018-2022: the FIFA calls the guideland
The Executive Committee of the FIFA on the Sunday is called the guidelands of the world communities 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice in which the range of influence and the lobbying of the technical criteria is driving into the background.
However, a matter is sure: the output 2018 of the FIFA King Discipline will be found in Europe, their traditional Hochburg (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands).
The exhibition 2022 will then fall a little more exotic; the international football band hopes that the primary on the African continent in 2010 can win new territories (Katar, Australia), or continue its desolation in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons associated with delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Katar, the Belgian and Netherlands Government Board, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world's majority.
Thus, the works were moved behind the culs until the last minute.
It is difficult to create a hierarchie of the candidates.
According to the FIFA Evaluation report, the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts are better arguments than their competitors.
But these suggestions will not be so worthy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee for the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was in the beginning of the emergency of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Themarii and Amos Adamu), had also been good for the chances for their own country, the wheel of the footballs, to destroy that only one time the world's majority was exposed, in 1966.
The BBC had resigned a documentary report on the monthly day, with three influential members of the Committee, which included Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
The reason is enough to hurt the FIFA and to bring the English responsibilities in the opportunity that were working in the first line with David Cameron in these last weeks a intensive lobbying.
The Government team hopes for a re-upgradation of his proper Tony Blair's ships, which had received the organization of the Olympical Games 2012 in 2005.
Has this intensive use enough to review the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less secure because the Duo Spanish Portugal does not miss a threat with his already experiencing stages, his expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
However, the economic and financial sides of the two countries may deal with their ambitiations.
The potential repressions against the English and the doubts of the Solvency of Spain and Portugal allow Russ' opportunities, which have become a serious outside in the directory (Stadians, Hotels, Transports).
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided that the unexpected adjudication on the monitoring of the English Press "the unexpected competition in the preparation of the vote" since the Commission members.
"Man tried her with trick, trying to compromit her," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States appear to be strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be logical favorites.
First economic world power, FIFA's headsponsors, the country seems to show a long list of benefits against Japan and South Korea, which separately have established a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates look forward for two countries that have organized the concurrent war in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA has replaced the WM 2026 for China, which allows Asian chances to be dependent on 2022.
With Australia and Katar, who had gone through the expectation of futuristic stages all registers, the FIFA persecuts its education in new regions, but these two countries have a greater risk because it is awareness.
Australia could also have suffered the reliable neurgency of the FIFA, as well as Japan and Southkorea.
Second Mandat: Publicity
Gaulle was really shutting.
Mitterand had let him believe he's stealing.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the smallest steps.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than these.
A mandat in Elysée calls the next time.
The current State Board will therefore be Kandidat in 2012.
But the publicity is the side of the mystery, which appeals the President's function, is not good to face.
So you have to do that as if the fortan's duplicate.
In one, as well as in another sense.
2006 the annexers Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third mandate was not excluded without believeing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured to take his decision "in the end of 2011."
That he would give the perspective of "due Mandates" at the service of Elysée before the UMP Parlaments, he would have extended a little fiableness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
It's wrong.
The President just reminded that the 2008 amendment of the conformity is limited to the number of five years of office periods only two.
He made a festival, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he considers the President's election in a humorful sound.
"You've been in the worst case seven and half years with me, or the best case," he explained to them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010, "Don't believe I don't think about the phase."
His words from the past do not make him any more to the candidate than at the day, but not less.
If they call comments, then for a double reason.
The declaration of the concurrency around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the capture of the competition with Segoléne Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy, to manifest themselves.
In addition, it is its public candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS are considered more early than accepted to fight.
The bad questions on the other side.
For the first time, the choices of the rights would have a candidate of Francois Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the question of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," reacted directly and carefully to the field of the Prime Minister.
"If he had been a deadline as possible, he wouldn't have a candidate," described Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will be steadfastly believed to be able to gain," corrected Alain Juppé, who has invented himself with the publicity.
Euro: the ECB is required to maintain its purchases of State papers
The last assembly of the Central Bank Strategy of the ECB in the past year should provide opportunities to show how it comes from the crisis, or at least announce a large number of inconventional measures of the money policy, which should come to the end of the year to its conclusion.
The crisis of the European State Decrease is committed to the Central Bank in Frankfurt, which is not in doubt, even today, more than the specific situation on the European passenger markets to not exceed their disasters.
The political costs would be too high.
The French Financial Ministry Christine Lagarde, last night, welcomed a press conference which has been adopted by the ECB, the active role of the solution of the state budget of Europe.
She didn't suggest whether she was the opinion that the Central Bank could still do more, for example, by accumulating its programme of purchase of State leaderships.
"I keep my opinions for my European trade partners before (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, in Brussels, in Brussels, his audience was not very applied about its proposals, but it is much more intended to indicate that the programme of buying of state papers on the secondary market would "extension" and that we will see the meeting on the day of the meeting "Committing the decisions."
The only conscience: the ECB will not change its leadership at 1%, the historical less level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's rooms' obligations were doubled at about 1,35 billion euros last week.
And according to the indications of some manufacturers, they must have achieved new buying to Irish and Portuguese State papers yesterday.
The central banks of the Eurosystem have been carried out from May 2010 from 67 billion euros.
Under the manufacturers, the anticipation of a further persecution of the purchase course will not be indicated (see page 29).
The peoples have no more expected to change the cursive changes.
If the trading employees are already lost from the ECB's arts of over three months, they will still make the unlimited money reserves freely, as well as a period of a week to three months.
The people's effects have already been considered that this measure will be exposed for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in an important way."
"Other, she would have come into the risk to develop new spendings on a short view," said Michael Schubert, the peopleswirt of the trade bank.
"A progressive expansion for the history of the first quarter of 2011, it seems likely to me," anticipated his side Norbert Brüms, peoplewirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the market of the State decreasing, the ECB raised such a purchase volume to obligations that buy the train market, Norbert adds brems.
In view of the relevance of the exponed position of the European banks on the markets of the state decreasing in the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no other choice than maintaining their presence on the market.
"They must take care of each price to the officers of missing investors on the market, and thus act in order to prevent the precaution of the costs paid to the most severe States," announced an important obligation container yesterday.
Because if the costs are set to a high-flight, the States would still have been prohibited to reduce their decrease or to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the Euro.
The Government of Berlusconi is in Italy in deterioration
After a weekly beginning for Italy, the situation has been a little deceived last with the backing of the eggs for 10 years.
A return to the throat silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Economic Ministry, the Governing President Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "unentificable" and had not heard it with a "inheritable" weekend, however, the relevant decreased immediately.
On Wednesday, it would have obtained its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts to detect the competition risk were estimated at 263 points, which had produced a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had indicated that the disrepance of Spain was with the German investment at 400 basic points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had been considered as "wrest" from the "markturbulencies" and a potential impact risk from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third population of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, peoplewirt in Hudson Institute.
In the context of this, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the weakest steel officers that bring the State in danger to reduce its financial needs.
The last Brussels' prognoses were a cold dust for the Government.
It is expected to be an Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and from 1,4% in 2012, although the budgetary budget of this seat is reviewed in the seminar of 1,3% related to 2,3%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates the budget deficit in the next year will be 4,3% of the BIP (in accordance with 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead 2,7%).
It is therefore the new budget collective that could be used after the Federal Ages to a total of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new spruit measures must be taken," my Economic Controller Olli Rehn.
At the same time, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The basic feeds of Italian economy are all right and its accounts are regulated, that we have already repeated for a long time," ensures Arrigo Sadun, Italian faithful countries of the International Monetary Fund, which is considered by the IWF with Italy.
"In the moment there are no problems, no short-term, nor long-term views, since Italy, instead of its high-term destruction (119,2% of the BIP in 2011, A. R.) is required to be smaller stabilisation steps than other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, Chef-Volksite of the OECD.
Remain the question on the political instance.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be transmitted to an untrusted proposal of the deputy room, according to which the previous elections have already been organized in March.
There is therefore a little useful period for a decision-making in respect of a serious crisis before.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures after
Christine Lagarde had been expressed yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "I think you still have shown it on Sunday and evening: the Europeans are prepared and entailed to defend their money and their money area."
Although it was completely related - the ships signed yesterday at the feet of the European State obligations were water on the debts of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization, it can not be the talk.
The Rating Agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could remove the Corruption Mark of Portugal, which is most effectively the objective of the speculators today.
"Which in May is a real manner of clarity and political validity loading particularly on the bank systems," the opinion of the Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time is very longer than the markets."
The European countries, as well as this climate, as well as the danger that is in it, intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anticrises measures.
The informal consultations between the financial ministers concerned directly and the other senses of G20.
This also regards the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is coming today.
On the plan, the percentage of non-conventional measures to reduce the eurozone countries in the market's cross (see below).
What the EU Stabilisty Fund has promoted, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started on Sunday in Singapore his Asia Tour to inform the investors in Fernost about the developments in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit funding, he will certainly prepare the earth.
The first paper expenditure since the EU Stabilisty Fund is provided for for the next month.
Yesterday, a official American representative of the Agent Reuters had been convinced that the United States supported a potential increase of the additional, direct enhancement of the IWF's mobilised fund.
Portuguese and Spain, the countries in the first-line, are invited to take structural reforms, especially in the field of the market organization.
Reforms to be achieved to the staff measures, however, to show effects in the near future.
Lisboa and Madrid were along with other way than this Greece and Ireland have done.
Even the one, as well as the other, should be dismissed of any price to obtain international assistance before they establish their own budget correction and decided on unaccessible structural reforms that turn their trust.
The European Capitalizers continue to discuss the options available to inform the normalization process of the markets of State leaders.
Axel Weber, who was located on 24 November on the traveling in Paris, was first presented the idea that if the 750 and the international monetary funds were not enough, the Union would not want to go back to the own board.
The people efficient of Barclays Capital, on the market of the European State Decrease, decided that a long-term rate of 100 billion euros would be sufficient as a direct liquidity price.
This means exists: the European mechanism dotated financial stabilisation, which is currently $60 billion euro.
A assistant who has all the chances to be examined in Europe's main cities.
In particular, when the market conditions are covered.
Snow and Glates: 24 Departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes are still increasing transport difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of the Britannica, and to enhance various economic activities.
Thirty-fifty Departments are now in alarm level Orange due to the snow and glass risk.
The regions of your, youure-et-Loir, Deux-Sevres and wine have already arrived in the alarm level of Orange 20 departments; 18 from Middle Wednesday and two, the Dordognes and the Girondes, then later in the night.
According to Meteo France, the intensive snow spectaculars tackles the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snow easy on the Ile-de-France.
The departments concerned are expected by 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even to 5 cm in Paris.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse Normandie, Ille-de-France and Limousin.
The snow cases are sufficient to prevent transport restrictions and to intensify certain economic activities, says Meteo France.
In the region Côtes d'Armor, several regional streets are locked in more than 7,5 tonnes, including Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in the United Kingdom is very difficult to use the vehicle only in the case, and the use of some TER passengers has been driving over the whole day.
In the Picardie, the trading for Sunday was held.
No specific restrictive measures have been proposed in the Mediterranean.
The prefector "requests the car carriers to higher care on the streets and to adapt their travel treatment."
The General Directory for the Civile Airport (DGAC) requested the airport company to stretch up on 25% of its Paris airport Roissy and 10% of the aircraft from Orly at the end of the expected, strong snow events.
The DGAB recommends the airpassengers to contact their aeroplane company.
Gatwick Airports in South London and the airports in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Sunday.
Metro Grand Paris: First financial scenes
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ille-de-France is in full age, it is billions.
At least in the discussions.
This is particularly the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which should be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the SGP's beginning in the way, the State called a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical scheme, this is the sum of the SGP that would then be allowed to provide a part of the financial sum of the markets to their double.
Today, it has finally come to the first higher calculations.
The fulfillment household of 2010, which has been issued by the Financial Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures proposed to achieve the first part of these money.
It is about two measures: the design of a special staff for the conclusion and a higher management of the offices in the Ireland France.
Firstly, Article 15 of the Law Design, "the most beneficiary of the public legal Institute Société du Grand Paris."
This is signed: "The product of this assessment is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorder of the existing company management: "To modernize this to increase it from its product and to transmit this increase of the society du Grand Paris."
How much would that bring?
A reputation.
This summary is not included in the text.
From the four billion, you're far away.
"The resources will be carried out to the four billion euros of the capital dotation which will be established by the State and the Société du Grand Paris will be established and implemented for the project."
In the SGP, this system doesn't seem avoidable.
"From the moment you are packed income (the two staffs, for R.), the projection can spread over three years and then create from the four billion," is explained.
"This is noted in the Budget and continued."
The SGP proposes that 2013 will be started to note the 4 billion for the budget 2014.
This measure, which four billion promised, can still be seen longer, is dangerous to call a right movement to the Parliament's debate.
The first public meeting is located on 7 December.
Rack hackers and emissive spions
The business WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, she was a manifest scandal, a scandal, which is only a skandal in the ministry's dignity, which rules the relationship between the States, the citizens and the price.
On the other hand, it reports deeply changes on international level, and makes a proposal on the future dominated by the Regression.
But let's go forward the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act created by a secret service (a single x-believable nation) is exclusively combined from periodic sections.
The "extraordinary", American emergency of the sexual habits of Berlusconis no more than what you have been reading for months, as well as in each x-believable journal (except those who are the owner of Berlusconi), and the horrible carriedical profile Gadafis bought Kabarett artists since long-term substance for their sketch.
The rule, after which the secret folders can be available only from already known news, is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library that reviews estherical publications, you will recognize that every work (with the Gral, the mysterium of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Ross Cruzler) is reacted to what was already written in previous works.
It is not only that the author of the okcult texts wanted to publish research (but because he didn't know where news would be found on the non-existent), but because those who move to the ocultism, in nothing other than they believe what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secrets.
The informant is false, and false (or restricted spirits) is also the head of the secret service (only he may be whatever, for example, the editor in Liberation), who only recognizes what he recognizes.
The Top Secret Information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message in Rome to the State Decade, were the same as those who had already published the week before.
So why was such an exhaustion made for the emergency of these directorys?
On one side, this is what every person has already known, and even though the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Government captains can also call against themselves or take a airport to meet the Sunday - their diplomatic function has lost and have changed, except some small representation tasks, in spionage centres.
Each favorable visitor of the films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen to the absence that you do to ignore this.
However, the fact that the fact is to repeat it publicly, the task of disease is lost and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-life hacker can attach the secrets of the most powerful country of the world, has a significant fight against the price of the State dessert.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims, more than the "sharpfriend".
But let's see the deep-grass nature of what happened.
Mothers, in Orwell’s times, could all the powers like a big brother who controlled each piece of his submanents.
Orwell's prophecy had been able to make a perfect way to control each move through the phone, every arrested transaction, the visited hotel, the selected cars and so further; the citizens would be a total sacrifice of the power.
But if you take care of what is today that even the secret crypts of the power can't go out of the control of a hacker, then the control passing will listen to be directed by one and will be a crystal.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the rider of the citizens - can bring the secrets of the power in experience.
But how can a power that is not able to achieve their own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be held); it is also true that all knowledge of the character Berlusconis character or marks in the basis is a free secret of the secret because it is the public speech preserved; but in the style of WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meaning that they were all powerful.
WikiLeaks didn't do Sarkozy or marks wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this restriction that has been added to such a mighty power?
It is obvious that the states in the future will not be given more online information - that would be equal to one of the expenditure in the streets.
But it is also clear that it is to be forgiven with the current technologies to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier to find if and when a state team moved in a airport and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could some relationships be discussed in the future and only for some ears?
I know very well that my proposal is at the moment after science fiction and romantic, but I need to imagine the Government's agents to be in secretly moved on uncontrolled march routes, their communications are not in any way other than in the only mind, and the few written information they have obtained, covered in the challenge.
The information would be stored in a single copy of locked loads: based on the spion test of Watergate was less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today's pre-progress as a crowd was raised up.
A centuries after the telegraph revolutioned the communication, the Internet rebuilds a telegraph with (telephonical) draft.
The (analogs) video cassets had allowed the film researchers to explore a video band for bands by playing from behind and all the secrets of the mount, while the (numerical) CDs could not be allowed to be able to cut down from chapter to chapters, so in macroportions.
With the high speed travels, it is required for three hours from Rome to Mailand, while it is required by aeroplane, including three-minute hours.
It is therefore not exciting that policy and communication technology return to cars and horses.
A last watch.
In the past, he tried to understand the prices of the secrets between the messages.
The news require confidential information from the pressure.
Clima: how France delights his financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty is the time to examine the maintenance of rapidly resolved financial promises (including "Fast Start" or broken funds) which have been implemented by developing countries.
And now the large French beauty are discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have been committed to offer 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7,2 billion over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (e.g. 420 billion per year).
In addition to the opening of COP16, the EU has carried out all registers to ensure their partners from the fact of their commitments on the fast-start funding: detailed progress report of their Member States, the Press Conference, the great neighborhood, the brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is a precise value and grade for its own value: developing countries and civil society will like to see it if all developed countries have made the same priority.
The EU states that in 2010 2,2 billion euros have been released, which brings them on the right way to respect their commitments of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But if you watch in detail, the things are a little complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Treaty to ensure that a additional use has been introduced without access to public development assistance.
Sorry, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission proposed a harmonization, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the right value that he considers as the best.
The EU Commission, for example, has been exceeded as a jurisdiction value for those who are in 2009: the international financials will be maintained, and it is in the framework of the "Fast-Start" financing for three years more than 150 million.
Other countries have chosen the same values, or in respect of year or in respect of conditions on the level of public development assistance.
In the context of France, the financing of "also new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
Otherwise expressed: There are no valid values in the expenditure of the past year or on the global level of public development assistance.
The total sum of the French support of developing countries may be stabil (or also take) - France proposes to maintain its obligation in respect of "new and additional" finances.
Another, decision-making element is the encryption in skins and driving.
There is no rule over it, and everyone chooses its account mode.
Some, such as France, are equal to 1 € as equal to 1 €.
Obviously, this is only difficult to repeat: the problem is not comparable.
If the use of debts for certain pure investments (offensively linked projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is crucial to present the euro, which is accepted as equivalent for an euro sold, and only the costs of the capital market should be retained as an enhancement (e.g. the equivalent of a quota).
However, France has nothing different in the meaning of the following interpretation: it "responses" its obligation of 420 million euros, taking it 91,5% (389,8 million euros) and 8,5% spends) 36,1 million euros - see the EU document also to convince himself.
France is the only country of the EU, which uses the debt in a large way.
Germany requires 46%, while Danish, Netherlands or Slovakia (in addition) to 100% of their obligations.
Furthermore, if the overall majority of the European Union gives 1€ to fulfil their obligations, France is just 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Nice hokuscopes!
All of France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindling: to one part with a vital development of the action on time and to another part with the reality of financial use.
France is able to believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, and it is 36,1 million euros.
Manipulation of the Financial Ministry (which it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the Arbitrage) could be a double negative effect; one time, EU-internal (why do other Member States continue with the cost, if it is enough?) and then in the negotiations that developed countries are not completely completely completed...
The chapter of the rewarded finances is only a small question on relatively short time in comparison with the total discussions on climate.
But it could be too much in the increasing machinery of UNFCCC.
We hope that this is not the case.
Like that, it is unbelievable to learn his lecture from this first year of the first year.
In the first line, France could report a change in its type of publication for 2011 and 2012, although in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could submit the discussions on the state of war of long-term financials (in other, decisive and current discussions): it is not the question of the "recommendibility" or of the type of exhaustion of its dealings.
France could change his position to continue to be in the same way in respect of the fight questions, as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore involved in the New Environment Ministry Cosciusko Moriet, which will be included in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the Fast-Start France and its vision of "recommendibility" and the use of Darleen would be made by nature from the international confidence base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Children's pesticides
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, as a study published by the United Nations Generations Futures (exhaustive movement to protect the rights and the respect of the future generations).
The agreement that explains that their results "in view of the severe number of analysed tests do not play statistically significant values, but the illustration characters of the treatment of the problems processed," was usually buyed between July and September, from a nearly ten years of food consumed to the age and a temporary period in the supermarkets in oil and Paris.
These typical trees - including official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit, three milk products and 1,5 litres water per day - were also investigated as the labs of labs in search of chemical substances, pesticides, several metals and other smoke substances.
The cellar bilance is low-term: 81 chemical substances, including 42, as possible or probablely consistently, and five as safe carziogen classified, as well as 37 substances with endochrine sterefactor, based in studies of several institutions such as the international blood research center.
"If in the next total of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually included substance are not exceeded, however, it is very good that the reality in which the consumption may be carried out, or substances with endochrine stroke factors, is required."
For preparation to the morning, only the butters and the tee with milk already have more than ten of the possibility of cutting refugees and three safe as carcinogenes, as well as more than twenty residences that can be involved in the hormone system.
The aircraft imported from Brazil, as provided for the medium-time for the study, shows sports of six chemical substances, including a fonguid prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green bows of Kenya, included in the middle-seconds in which the studies have established a slightly prohibited incepts in the EU.
Furthermore, the hacksteak, the thin fish from the books, even the bagute and the couchummi of pesticides and other chemical substances.
The analysis of nitrates and chloroforms have been carried out in the light.
On the evening, the lachsteak was detected with 34, chemical restrictions at the "richestest", and even the plastics used in the microwelle was not loaded.
The cruel risk of this "shedstoff cocktails" for consumers "we're probably highlighted", so the study.
The "Alliance Europe Economic-Les Verts" (EEE-LV) proposed to introduce a Moratorium on the use of Pesticides to stop the "amount to civilization diseases".
In July a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) related to the presence of residences 365 various, in the areas and animals identified pesticides that were consumed in Europe under 76.
