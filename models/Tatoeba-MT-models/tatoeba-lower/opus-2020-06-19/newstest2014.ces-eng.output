The black coffee in your car?
While the American motor projecting is courageously trying to find money on the replacement of the raw network, many start to see the solution in a small black box that is easily entered into the device of your car.
The devices monitoring each kilometer that carried out and transmit these information to the officers are the control officers of Washington and the Offices for State planning to renew the sustainable American main routes financing system.
Normally, a fair projection of the damage has increased the intensive debat and the relationship of the various colleagues.
Libertarians met with the ecological groups and bought that the government could use these small cups that would notify kilometers and may also where you go – and then these information would be used to build money dimensions.
The party's scared.
The United States for Civil Freedom is also deep concerns and stated a number of problems with private protection.
And while the Congress can't agree whether they continue, some States don't expect anything.
They recognize how they can move in the next decade to the system where the driver pays for miles of streets after which he goes.
Thousands of motorists have already been the black boxes of which some of them have monitored using GPS, they took the test.
This is the real need for our nation.
“It's not the only thing that we can choose,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of State Administration in South California, which plans to start monitoring the passenger kilometers in each California motorism in 2025.
It changes the way we pay these data.
It serves this technology.
It is therefore that the Silnian Control Fund financed from the data that the American pays in the stages are on the day.
The Americans don't buy so many benzines as before.
Automobiles run a lot of kilometers to one gallon.
Samood federal payment, 18,4 cents of gallon, has not increased for over 20 years.
For the current high price of benzine, politicians will only take the money on the only cent.
“The day of the benzine is just not maintainable,” said Lee Munnich, a representative of a transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed the monitoring device to 500 cars to test this place system for a kilometer.
“It's the most logical alternative of a long view,” said he.
Experts call it a user plot in accordance with the number of passenger kilometers.
There is no surprise that this idea likes urbanistic liberals, because the data may be used to change the models of management of managers, which can, for example, help to restrict the transport rates and the creation of shipping plants.
Californian projectors look at this system in the planning of strategies to fulfil the objectives set out in the ambitional laws on global implementation.
But the Republic of Bill Shuster (President Pensylvania), the Chairman of the Transport Committee, said that it also was the most functional alternative longer.
The representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation organization are also closed by the thought that the drivers will pay for a kilometer.
"It's not a donation that is delaying in the black road," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for the Strategy in the Reason Organization.
People pay right for what they get.
The initiative also supports two ex-American Ministry of Transport, which had chosen in the Congress in 2011 to achieve the direction of the placement for a miles.
The American lone senate approved a pilot project for 90 million USD, which had to achieve about 100,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the smart representatives has been denied and did so because of the fear of the foreign lawyers of the citizens, which often means to smoke a lot of kilometers for the town.
However, several States and cities are still going to buy for their own growth.
The most horrible is Oregon, which ran into the largest experiment in the country 50,000 drivers.
These guidelines will soon begin to pay the State for the quick kilometers, instead of the payment for benzine.
The missing pilot project has already been finished.
New York's just trying a project.
Illinois is trying to try to be limited in the cost cars.
And Coalice I-95, which includes 17 State Ministers of Transport, together with the Northern States at the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only remain.
In Nevada, where the device has recently been built about 50 cars of goods, there were the managers of concern that the government is able to monitor each of their moves.
“Beings regarding the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, which leads the management of strategies and the operation of non-advanced Ministerial Transport.
It wasn't something that people wanted.
As a test project continued, the United States of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on their web sites: “It would be very easy to change this device to a full-specific monitoring device.”
There is no need to build a serious technical infrastructure that is unreasonablely extended to the economy of each day-day expenditure and accessories of individuals.
There is no difference between several States who are trying to find the available technology that would allow the State to monitor the number of kilometers of the car, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be quiet.
Hon brought some State Agencies to a small company in California with the name of True Mileage.
This company was not introduced originally in the action for the Government's assistance on the managers.
She wanted to explore on the exciting market with ensuring the legal responsibility where the leaders would pay on the basis of how much they were going.
But this device, which tests, applies to the attention of the engine network projectors, because it does not use GPS and adds only limited quantity of information that are regularly loaded through the modem.
“ People will like to go, if you don't follow their speed and their position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, there appeared a number of great errors.
They're a lot of lower and less incredible ways to do it.
In Oregon projecting experiments with the managers to be choiced.
They can choose GPS or without GPS devices.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and decide to pay the payment of the payment based on the average number of miles from all state citizens.
In other places, they hope that the obsessive publicity will come to this concept if the device will know more, not less.
In the city of New York, the transport officers are trying to exit the shipping devices that would be equipped so that it may be possible to pay payments in the parking hours to provide ensure in accordance with the passenger kilometers and to collect the data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can exit the transport process.
“The motorists will want to enter into it because of the value of the benefits of them,” indicates the project document of the city.
However, some transport projectors would like to know whether all the plastic discussions are not just a problem.
The Officers of the Metropolitical Committee for Transport in San Francisco say that the Congress would have a problem with the banched Silician Control Fund, very easy to resolve the increase of the payment from benzine.
A single or an annual rate may be attached to Hybrid or other vehicles that do not need a lot of balls, so they will pay the right part.
“No radically operations are required when riches are sufficient to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee for legislation and public interest.
If we do this, hundreds of million managers will be afraid of their private and many other things.
For the CSSD, the Saturday is running.
Social democracy speaks together with droves, humans and babies, and makes a common progress.
If social democracies are in a few weeks, they will be assembled to the operating table with fully respected partners who are set on the table of a ready list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
The CHSSD emissions then be jointly demanding coalitional threats, or cutting to the low minor government.
God of the Sobote after four days, when he went to the field of sympathies, he first shot.
Yesterday, he was not able to control the political grims and mainly needed the witnessed lying to reject.
The confirmed electoral on the side is only he, the other members shall be authorised to the key session of the Middle Executive Committee (APV).
I apologized the members of the grema and now and the citizens.
She doesn't lie, in personal life, nor in public.
"It was a mistake," he said, "It was a mistake," after the worst leader of the social democracy Michal Haschek.
He added that he couldn't be on the position of the first place.
"I will make my decision on 10 November to the UVV," said Hashek.
Likewise, he spoke the Chairman of the Chairman of the Children and the Boss of the Commander of the Jeroman Tejc.
However, he warned that he was chosen for two days ago.
Then both messengers announced that they would do everything for the fifty-year-old CCSSD club to sing one voice.
"I am a member of the CSSD for 15 years, I was always loyal to her mark and respected the decision of strange authorities."
It's another lie in the right transport.
Or, when the Sobotk Research and his exhibition from the exhibition team forgot that the Agency AVV was 57% of the fact that God's Sobotka was the candidate of the sites on the Premier?
The Boss CHSSD, however, made a powerful enemy to the next week.
His representatives have ten days to pay e-mails 192 members of this authority and media with the most different thresholds and phases, eventually remember the real errors of the Sobotkov political career.
It's gonna be strong to drink a smoke, it's apparent to the signs of the dark connection between the airbaron Down Bakal and the Sobotical Crystal.
The friendly relationship of God's Sobotky and the influenced lawyer of the Poor Council.
They build sports in the southern or marine organisation of the CSSD.
The words of the Austrian Prime Minister and the Sobotk's association Peter Kaynar: "Chartu 77, I signed that the earth does not rule idiots."
If the UVV had already come this week, the liars would probably be able to offer ritual sacrifices of their functions.
They'll slip the head in the ground and stay.
And now the chief winning boss CHSSD ends with the translation of Godhuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on OH in Sochi: Communication with Russia is anxiety
His mouth's mouth means an invisible smile, and then the depth will say, "It's serious."
Cooperation with the organization team of Olympia in Soci 2014 is a bit more compatible with Dr. Martin.
We can forget what was on the last olympian.
"Nothing works on the same way," says the chief olympian mission.
What's going on specifically?
The line of things works shortly and not exactly.
It's so funny.
In the view of the factors, it is relatively quick, in view of adding information on fundamental matters already not so much.
We need to have three months of them to add to us how officially the individual ices will be marked in order that we can do a whole number of things.
We're still waiting and they still say they're talking about this thing.
They're still talking about things.
Is there at least an olympian ice?
But this isn't a katastrophic state.
We went in empty rooms a month ago.
The houses are lucky.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are they gonna be ready?
Only basic beton, so that was the state before the month.
But they still have time.
Although there is dangerous that we're going to be a preventive 26th year, it's still feeling a leaf.
And if they don't hurt, what's going on?
Mr. Putin, would you think you'd call the army there?
It's probably like that.
It's just that the olympian ice is the bunch of the ice.
It seems serious that they don't hurt, for instance, they don't make detail.
Maybe they'll have paths in such a situation that we'll have to get with ourselves from the London hero.
But I believe it's something to buy.
How many cheese sports could go to Sochi?
Now they're 78, even though the number is changed in respect of nominal criteria.
The crossbrusslers likely go into the three-what they're out.
Martín Sabbliks also do not have to imagine, but otherwise it is in development.
Does you wait for the way to Sochi?
No, but if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26.
How they're looking for houses in the olympian bus, we know.
Even we had some things to meet a metro to not just believe in the cups.
We're also preparing a whole number of other things including transport.
What does the boss of mission doing for hundred days before the olympian games?
I am prepared for an annual evaluation of individual olympian sports, and I make a regular agent in the meaning of communication with the Organization Committee in Soci.
Putin promised an ecological olympian, a plan to make him a lot of secret supply
The fauces of the sports are already holding a metro to start olympian hero in Sochi, others look at their preparation are still greater.
Russian olympian, starting in the branch, it's like another skandal.
The Russians shall not be fulfilled by the promise that the preparations and conduct of her or at least in the country of Krasnoda, in the case of Kavkaz, where for four months, thousands of sports and ten thousands of visitors.
Last after an olympian in Vancouver, the Russian ship was set up very high, the Canadian games were in the history of olympiads as the best to the environment.
However, it seems that the obligation of the Russian President Vladimira Putina to coordinate games with the "Null Affair", he took for a long time.
The reporters of the AP Agencies found the construction of the structure material in the Ashtyr field in the area of Sochi.
Then the entire structure material, pneumatics, canvastors and isolation ports have already found in August, the ecologists, which immediately reported.
The Russian officers lost the hair and the ship was lost.
Just a minute.
Last week reporters gave a view to the summary of the size of three football peaks.
It is not the only one, in the areas of such places, a few, he wrote the British book The Times.
In the place of Russian ferry, the State Monopol, which built a road between the airport in Soci and the sport restaurant.
The company that has already cut 280 billion rubbers led one of the near Putin cooperators Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the guests founded some of the subdoctors.
The local citizens are almost disappointed.
According to Ashtir's resident around you are three months for day and night.
According to experts, the department contains the local river of Muslim, other ships and finally and the Black Sea.
"The water from here contains soccer waters for the next ten to 15 years," says the British letter Vladimir Kimaiev of the EWNC environmental non-zysical organization.
It is not the only problem of the Russian Organization Committee and Government.
The most oldest olympian in the history are one big tunnel according to the obsession.
For comparison: games in Soci will be 51 billion dollars, while the air olympiad in Beijing 2008 has gone to 43 billion.
The lone games in London were only 19 billion and the Vancouver's 9 billion.
Furthermore, corruption scenarios, project maintenance and fear, if finally it's a lot of dream, reports have also shown that in the work of sports and infrastructures, the human rights are not obtained.
The last month, one of the employees shocked his mouth to the protest that he didn't get two months.
Many are also afraid of how Russian organizators are fulfilled by the new law, which prohibites homosexual propagation.
Some visitors are intended to support Russian gay for olympiad.
A young couple looked at home with parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates had been a task to propose a house on the board that is living on the road of two streets, as well as the self-looking place is at some time.
The request continued to live in the house to two generations who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
Young guys needed a little office more.
The house stands on the road of two streets and on the ground of the ground.
The architects therefore decided to put every house to one of the household.
"With the proposal, we respected the family weaknesses, historys and reminders with the place of the present."
"Tre different home functions are several paths connected by the outer object, so everyone knows the presentness of others, but then they have their privates," explains the designers.
The household of parents is at the level of the garden with an older branch, to which family traditions and reminders are considered.
The single parts of the house are easily recognised as well as the various final editing fasad.
While the main segment of the building is from beton, which the plane was created by the panels from the office, part where the office is, is limited to white and remaining elements remained in the clean beton execution without other editions.
A lot of home walls are very simple, thanks to the interview of the house that is very carried out with exterior.
The household of parents, more than cook, food and resident, covers a small garden with a tree that has a great significance for the family.
The proposition of interior with external walls is submitted to the side wall that starts on the garden and continues to the rest.
The kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house of the main entrance in the field and then goes down on the streets to his space.
It's the main dominant of the house interior.
Their construction allows them to achieve a lot of natural light through them.
The architects tried to separate houses from others and press him something unique.
The house of a young couple is united as one open space with cookie parts, food and residents together.
From the terrace, it's only part of the wall with the pitched doors.
Working area with food and cuisine part in the house of a young couple.
The second pattern is composed as one large open space, which is freely passed on the ground, since it's a beautiful view on the Tokyo.
The Samoo office in the highest office is carried out in a clean combination of white and black colors.
Chodicha is a dominant element of the house interior.
The young couple enters the house of the main entrance, looks at the input ball and then gets up there.
Take academic freedom, pays it for Wednesday and ODS.
In the past months, I called the open letters of students, pedagogs and leaders of central and high schools in several countries to protect academic freedom before the election campaign that President Milosh Zeman carried on schools.
I met the greater or less success.
Rector Masarykov University in Brna, who refused the proposal of the Honor President of the SPOZ - the Seminar in the pre-selected period, has even received an invitation for the celebration of the State party of the Republic of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who have not been so staying and visiting Milosche Zeman have allowed: High Technical Learning in Brna, Gymnazium Gladnov in Austria, High School of Academy in Austria, Economic Academy in Colonia, University of J.E.
We are now meeting in Pardubians with continued proceeding policies on high schools.
New chosen messenger for ODS, thanks to the Electrotechnic Faculty and the Universities of Pardubice, Simoneon Karamazov, refuses to leave his academic function and also it seems normal.
Mr. Professor, it's not really like if you stay in the oldest city.
Would you like to attach to the chiefs of the CSSD, who are currently exploring the functions of the messenger and the officer and the same as they degrade both of the call?
So you tell people that they can handle both these raw functions left back.
I know, we have a example of Michal Haška that can even control some ten functions at the same time.
But it's probably not exactly the example of the person you should guide.
We will also find an increasing and positive example of MUDr. Fraňk's Stephans, who would like to leave a post to be able to fully carry out the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the function is that you are in accordance with the function that you have academic academic level of Pardubic Unity.
Pardubical ODS leaders see your current training on both beds as an achievement for the Union.
But you can help your school, too, without you stay thanks.
I think a similar view like I and Director Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your department and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the choices in the next options.
And that doesn't need to be long.
The green bullets in the Kuwaits, chemicals do not add to him
More than thousand tons of cycle green are wanted to produce in the Slovakian Fruit of Kunovice, which is in the Hame Food Group.
Sezona has started in October and a half-year-old cycle.
Health here from 1925 is still produced in traditional ways, so it's just a smoking in large tanks.
In modern industry, it's about railure.
Our workers are able to change at least 10 miles.
In each of the ten tanks, there will be 15 to 30 tons of green, the completion of one remains three changes," introduced the Slovak Fruit David Clodroba.
The heads of green car in the area of the company are directly from their fields of agricultors overwhelmed from Osterreich and Brazil.
The Workers of Fruty then clean the green, remove the shelters and house in the box.
From there the green grid falls into the basens of six-time-depths, in which white clothing and holidays work unleavenly.
That's what they're grateful for the unleavened air.
The last green plane is covered by the floor and threatened with water.
"The green crown then takes six to eight weeks for a spontan milk quality without any addiction of any substance supporting quality," advised Director Claudrob.
The natural process is responsible for the production in home conditions, the single levels of workers are requesting soil and conditions.
Green after the exposure, he's put to the full line.
They're balled in the skins or skins and are detailed by steriles.
Hame adds the cyclical green in particular to the Tunisia and Slovakia market.
It is also recorded in some other countries, such as the Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is achieved to cooperate with German in accordance with the monitoring of the United States
Edward Snowden, a friend of American officials, announced that it was appropriate to go to Berlin to give the German Parliament evidence if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander will not be able to provide answers to their activities.
The German sentence Hans-Christian Strebelle met Mr. Snowden in Russia in Russia, where he was made asyl, and acted with him about the opportunity to testify in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who carried a medium in Berlin on Friday, he says: "The result of my ability was just positive, the government continues to be held as a defense of events and trys to criminalize political proofs with several disasters that do not give a range of disagreements."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said that it believes that the support of the international community could overcome the Government of the United States to steal the offence of criminal acts against him.
The offence of the Ministry of Justice of the United States includes the spionship and the failure of the State authority.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister inside, said for the magazine Time Online: “When Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officers, we will find a way to allow it.”
In the relationship between the United States and Germany, the NSA has heard the phone of Angely Merkel's officers.
Thomas Opermann, a member of the Parliament, who cares on the report, said that if there were any opportunity to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness “with the dangers and that it would be completely destroyed with the United States”, it should be done.
Mr. Sträbelle, an apostle to the Parliament on the German part of the Green, published on his Twitter photo on which Mr Snowden is.
On their way to Russia, two German newspapers brought him.
Mr. Sträbelle said that, according to the ancient NSA contractual lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he had gone once.
If Mr. Snowden had been witnessed in Germany, he would need to ensure that there would be “in safety,” said to the Parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he broke a dream and triggered campaign connected to the prosecution that allowed him to leave the house.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world on his “political expressions” has made him an inquiry.
The entire and higher officers, including those in the United States, have determined that the non-resoluble system of public monitoring should be rejected.
The letter includes the proposal to cooperate with German authorities, "as the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
The killing we're sorry, but we're innocent, they're with the representatives of the Red Khmers.
Nuon Chea was two numbers in the Red Khmer hierarchy, and Kie Samphan was the former chief of the State.
For the Government of the Red Khmers, which in 1975 to 1979 was described on maoism and nationalism, has come to life in the consequence of the exploitation, hunger, disease, murdering and transportation of more than three million Kambodsians, then at least fourth of the population.
The officer of the S-21 declared the International Criminal Court for Cambodge in 2010 the useful prison penalty.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murdering, rebellion and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan tried to believe they work in the best interest of the nation, and they didn't think what is the real range of killing.
"It's easy to say that I had everything to know, to understand everything, and then to fix and correct the situation," announced Kie Samphan's fourth century before the judge.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered the Red Khmer's Khmer's chairs to "the people have come wrongly or killed them to destroy their food or to sprinkle the genocide."
But he accepted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to forgive publicity, victims, families, all the Cambodish people," said.
Fifty-year-old Bin Sivla, which came on the Rude Khmer's mode of 11 relatives, AFP agency said that you can't forgive Noon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"It just wants to be free of sin."
"It's gonna be worried about the other," she said.
"If he hadn't made commands, his device wouldn't kill," he added that the leaders of the Red Khmer are "wrighter than the Mount."
Before the Court, he also had to be a "minister of frontier" of the Red Khmers Ieng Sary, who died years in March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then the Ministry of Social Affairs, in September 2012, looked for an unexpected process.
The Leader of Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is able to pay the manufacturer
Frontier Airlines plans for its years to count amount in up to 100 USD to save the manufacturer load on the ball.
Frontier Airlines plans to carry a payment to 100 USD for a manufacturer, and 2 USD for a coffee or sodove, although in their notifications in the middle stated that the travelers will be able to leave the entire floor.
The new payment for the manufacturer has been reached in the front-based area, so the small income will also be low.
The Frontier community says that 25 USD will be accounted if the payment is paid before and 100 USD, if they will be traveling with plastic waiting to come to the gate.
The Frontier Kate O'Malley's talking company said that the studolar payment has to make a way to pay forward.
“ We wouldn't have chosen this payment, ” said she.
Aeroplane companys began paying the first and second income in 2008.
The passengers tried to exit these plants and cut into the manufacturers hidden in the basic space as they could, so they were often mistaken in this area.
The flowers are one of the way to learn to take less things on the board.
O'Malley said that the meaning of this new plane is really not to get more money.
It is about that Frontier's most faithful companies have expressed clearly that the place in the higher level is still more difficult.
Those who buy airports on web sites will not be paid.
This means that one traveling in the front of the Frontier's door may bring a shipment for which he won't pay anything, while the other traveling in the front for the same front is paying 100 USD.
O'Malley said that web pages and refrigeration procedures will be established to ensure that the traveling traveling will be learned before his arrival to the door.
The new payment of Frontier's company for the manufacturer will not yet be valid before the year, but the date was not yet established.
A lot of time, the aircraft of the aircraft and other aircrafts are often disturbing, but the aircrafts love them.
They say that the manipulation is worthy of money, and the travelers who require this service to pay for it.
Many in Wall Street take another payment for the ransom as a sign that the aircrafts are trying to choose money to keep the aeroplane costs after years of loss.
But most of them did not shoot on the packs of the manufacturer.
The Spirit Airlines company as the first payment of the manufacturer carried out three years ago, and another low-contained company Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only company that also has such plans is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the advice in the air transport area of Jay Sorensen, which is strictly monitoring additional plans.
In his report from December 2011, Spirit reported that the payment for the manufacturer of the company would be offered by 50 million USD annually.
Sorensen, an old leader of Midwest Airlines company, recently flyed with Spirit's company and felt on what he saw at the gate when the travelers met with an ordinary party of Spirit's company.
“ The traveling to the aircraft was the best I saw in my air carrier, ” he said.
I was waiting for me to see the smoke of the dogs and the shoes at the door.
The aircraft was full, he said, "and the ship has gone in the skin."
Frontier also after the model of the Spirit company applied for the coffee, thee, sodov and djius.
Frontier showed that the travellers that get limonad or djius can leave the entire coffee and the coffee will be soon fulfilled.
The water will still be driving.
The US Airways community tried to carry up drinks in 2008, but after the traveling of seven months later, there was no other significant airport company.
The last market of Frontier's company to pay the manufacturer, if the traveller does not solve years directly from this aeroplane company, it is the last trying to direct the registers directly on their websites.
Aeroplane company pays the Internet travel sales, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each airport sold.
This was given to all aeroplane companies to lead traveling to purchase directly from them, in order to do it through Internet travel agents.
However, Frontier's community has been far away in this area.
In September, she started to give the clients who purchased the Internet travel agency, only half miles in the framework of the faithful programme.
In the middle of a reward for meal found at 25 per cent of miles from the path.
So the path with Frontier's company is $1,000 miles buyed through the Internet travel agent means a reward of 250 miles.
The companies also allows the company to choose before its sitting only if the purchases are directly carried out through the Frontier company's websites.
Frontier's company has a faithful basis for the customers in her housetown, but her business is starting to deal with and lose money.
In accordance with the financial results referred to in the Mediterranean Republic Airways Holdings markets, 9 per cent and the transport capacity was reduced at least 13 per cent in the first fourth year.
The Republic community is solving this aeroplane company tries to just resolve the financial problems of the Frontier company.
For the NSA web pages, it does not cause hackers, but “internal error”
The Secret National Security Agency introduced the last week, that her websites were falling for a few hours last week because of an internal error, neither because of the hacker attack, as some stated on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov sides have not been available for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that has been established during regular updates,” the Spionage Agency reported.
The problem will be removed tonight.
The statement that the case was caused by DDoS (distributed service refusation) is not true.
Before this evening, online snippets indicated that NSA web pages were not working at least six hours, and pages are not yet available for some users.
Previously, the NSA speaker of the ABC News reported that the internal civil networks of the Agency were not threatened.
The speaker said that no injured information is not threatened.
At least one group of Hacker Activists on the Internet stated that it was responsible for the NSA page by the DDOS attack.
The DDoS resources are proposed to pay the target websites by information until the servers are attempted and the page falls.
This cybernetic taktic is relatively simple and the meaning of attacks is not to go into the internal target system network.
The NSA Super secret Agency, which has ever received a transview No such Agency, has been in the past months along the range of west and home monitoring programmes in the middle of public attention and the customs criteria, in accordance with the product of the absence of NSA secret files from the Agency and their examination of the old employer Edward Snowden.
This increased control of the locking agent has increased the previous speculation that this event was the result of the target cybernetical operation.
The risk of Bombardier company has fallen in the consequence of the cluster of additives and meetings
The Canadian aeroplane producer and bottles Bombardier reported in the fourth of the 15 percent of the pure weight, which is made to be less than the number of aeroplanes and additional aeroplanes in the third-term and contractual problems in the field unit.
The Bombardier community also published no data on aeroplane for its new aircraft type CSeries, or did not provide any active information if this aircraft has received an ambitious plan to start the commercial operation from the next September.
After a test airport almost a month ago and half of the aircraft only three times and a question of whether the test phase goes well.
The results have not been fulfilled and the action on the ground in Toronto was 8 percent.
The State Bank Analytics Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating of “hover precision” to the “economic sector” with expecting that the burst will be raised during the next fourth year or two limited growth.
“Besides smaller additives of aircraft, we had expected greater expected, we were explicitly claimed to the transport area,” reported Doerksen in the report of the clients.
As the test programme will continue, we believe that Bombardier's company will get new CSeries airports.
However, if there are no new meetings noticed in the past months, we suggest that the growth of the market is growing within this programme.
The Bombardier company hopes that the CSeries airports are tested in the undermarket area that now domain Boeing and Airbus.
The first test airport was held in March and after a few months later in September first year.
However, the number of aeroplanes of the CSeries aircrafts has 177, as potential purchases wait for the results of the trial airport to verify the companies concerned with lower consumptions and costs of this transport airport.
In the present time, 403 contracts and obligations are from 15 customers and managers.
The Executive Director Peter Beaudoin expected that Bombardier would achieve its objective of 300 responsibilities at the first airport.
The leading workers also ensures analysis and media that the programme is progressed in accordance with the plan.
“The trial aircraft has not remained longer than it was expected, ” said in the Conference of Beaudoin, and noted that the surveys on the land and software updates were planned during the aircraft.
Every manufacturer plans it different.
We decided to solve the first year and then to focus on the update and we did it.
This will be done during the whole aircraft.
According to the Bombardier company, the second of the five test airports should be repaired in the past weeks and the other unexpected afterwards.
The analyticals, however, are sceptics to say that the first lawyer could begin to carry CSeries 12 months after his first plane.
The Bombardier Community claims that its plan was assessed by the airport, and in the following months, updated information is provided.
“This short-term age trials – although it is in accordance with the internal plan of Bombardier – of course, our opinion is that it will be held on the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
From 172 million USD or 9 cents for one action in the past year, on the third quarter of the end 30th September, a clean rate of Bombardier company was 147 million USD, or 8 cents for one action.
The reformed costs for one action have not been changed in 9 cents.
Round marginally pulled from 4,2 billion USD to 4,1 billion USD.
Thomson Reuters analytics expected 10 cents for one action and repair 4,56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft produced that 57 aircrafts were added only 45 aircrafts for year before the fourth year.
The pure contracts have fallen from 83 aeroplanes to 26.
Unfulfilled laws in aeroplane were created to 30 September 32.9 billion, which does not get to 31 percentage.
“The results in the air were in accordance with our views, but the lower accommodation and the total market states were struck us,” said Beaudoin.
The expenditure in the air industry has increased 13 per cent to 2 billion USD.
Bombardier, the biggest productor of the world, pointed out that the increase in this division has increased at least 11 per cent to 2.1 billion USD.
Unfulfilled provisions were created to 30 September 32.6 billion, which is contrary to 31 percent of marginal growth.
The resources in transport division have affected problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The officers said that the fourth year will provide new views.
Action of Bombardier, which also announced the contribution of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichette, was spread during the trade in the fourth day afternoon 8.5 per cent of 4,83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial airport producer and the nearest concurrent of the Bombardier company, announced in the fourth-year quarter of the decade.
The cocaine worker who warned the mafian before police investigation is in prison
Basharat Dieta (42) had to provide information to the king to Nelu Scarbrough.
The advocate was afraid of his drug integrity.
The Liverpool Corn Court sent him in three years of prison.
The shipping officer who informed the drug mafian about a large police investigation because he feared that his drug integrity would be cleared for three years of prison.
Basharat Dieta (42), after the suspect of the use of cocaïne, shepherds to Nelu Scarbrough to provide citizen information on the investigation of the drug activities.
The advocate, whose advice was “Bash” (party) and who was made criminals as the best lawyer, was after Scarborough's police monitoring in the previous drug managements, was arrested at home in 2011.
Policists saw Sarborough (32) as he left in the lawyer house in Blackburn in Lancashire, who was just at the dinner with his colleagues from Pravnical Company, three cocaïne.
On the basis of the tests in which the pieces of cocaïne were found in his hair, on his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Dieta was a regular user of the class A drug.
In the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men in Scarborough and his company.
All four surveys were observed in the framework of a large investigation with heroin and cocaïne in the Lancashire areas, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of policy rates, heroin and cocaïne were held at about 1,5 million GBP together with 200 000 GBP in order to be ready, 32 other persons were finished in prison with them.
Dieta (42) transmitted a criminal information with fear that it would come to the cocaïne.
Today Dieta, who works in the legal company of Forbes Solicitors with a sister in Blackburn, murdered before the Liverpool's corner court a minute of judicial time when he was considered a trial treatment that in two cases he took the execution of justice.
During the previous hearing, it was approved to cut cocaine.
After the police investigation, Scarborough was discovered that he was in a regular phone contact with Ditto in 2011.
Two detective surveys followed, signed his arrival to Diet's house and saw him how he put drugs clean 60% under the lawyer's table in the black golf hands.
Lastly he was Scarborough and Diitat, who was on the evening of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park, in a regular phone conversation.
The employer returned home where the drugs found, and between both people were nine conversations.
In the Court, the drugs were found in his hair, money and his credit cards and that Dieta was a “regular user” cocaine.
It was later arrested, but the use of cocaine was broken, and he said that he had spoken with a surprised deal because he was his client, and argumented that their conversation falls into the "trained communication".
While he was arrested, Dieta took his money and tried to get out of her a few credit cards, but all were arrested and the hairs were removed to him.
At the police audience, he said that he was conducting a officer as to his home address, as well as on the workshop, and that the clients visited him at home because of the workshop.
However, the Court heard that after key arrests, he contacted a significant player in the drug additive ring, some of which had already been inclined to share them what the detective knows about them.
The Procurator Anne Howte said: "Who else is more knowledge of that it is not lawless than the legal manager in the criminal area."
Mr. Dieta is accused of the disagreement of its legal officer's position and that he has been achieved to a too close contact with the customer.
The survey we talk here is not only about the drug dealer, but the drug dealer who carries his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations would have been legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it's been far far from the border of a regular lawyer-life relationship.
The police investigation had how much more he could allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta didn't bring his professional good news, but he even destroyed it.
With some of his clients he was too close to him, especially with Scarborough, and allowed him to be disappointed by his independence.
He refused and said, "If I would have been a comprehensive lawyer that I am not, and I would like to give the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately."
However, after hearing the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Dieta was a criminal defense in the criminal area at the moment when he began to get drugs from organized criminals."
His compliance on cocaïne has made him increasingly vulnerable and rarely to the objectives of the representatives of the organizated crime group that had given him for a task to collect the precious information on the police investigation.
The right leaders must keep the highest principles of unbelievableness and have in public strengthen confidence and feeling that they can fulfill them.
Mr. Diet's convinced this confidence and tried to hide his professional post.
One of the serious and organized criminal acts in Lancashire led against Mr. Diett investigation, on the basis of the three cases of cocaïne, and now for the defense of justice, which demonstrates our obligations to bring crime before the court.
This case should be served for all criminals as a warning that no one does not beyond the dose of the law.
We'll find you and put you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was judged for 14 years after the prison was announced by a collaboration in order to add heroin, cocaine and conopia.
Other thirty-five persons entered into trade were held at the total of 153 years for drug trafficking.
At his web page, Dieta ordered a online conversation, in which he said that his exposed work would be right to take customers from the block of death in America, as a host on the party, as a motivation for the work, he would have made an unrelated motivation for the work.
He's talking about the government with Klaus and Spider.
Now the people of John Kasala sent against Babies.
The people have received the elections of fourteen messengers, so only the third number of social democracies or ANO managers.
But at least one of them, they enter at least one expenditure.
In the team that has already started to achieve the possibility of coalyce, John Kasala - a man who led the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social democracies or Andrej Babish have no such murder on their side.
It may be this time to remind the first exemption in 1992 when the OSS was also full of the new side.
"The experiences were at the same time minimum," says Kasal, how the air conversations will be developed.
Kein pressure built by the control law on media
“It's a terrible report and it's on the place to ask what the Parliament will ensure that tomorrow the independence of the jurisdiction would not be easier to decline tomorrow,” have reported the proposal of the law as a contrast.
“This law is worthy and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, General Director of the Capital Group, which is also CapitalFM, one of the most remarkable independent states and reporting websites.
He said that the new Mediterranean officer would “allway be predicted because it was extended by the hand of the government” and that the limits relating to the contents and the reclaims would be disturbing the position of Keni in the world's economy.
"I hope that the President will hear us, and we will ask him to deny this proposal of the law and return him to the messengers," he said.
According to the report of Star proposal of the law, the Government actually transmits the “full control of media” and the new standards indicate that the democracy and the freedom of the appearance in Kenya “avoided by the summer of the morning” and criticizes the proposal of the law as a“personal”.
The adoption of the proposal of the law is in the middle of a number of measures to send national security directly after the close attack of the Islamic Shooter in the Western Gate's purchase center.
The wrath of the officers turned back when she broke up the record of security cameras, on which the military soldiers sent down in the place of a attack, a lot of trade with luxury goods.
The police director reacted so that he left two newspapers and the media worker to hear, but the call was later loaded.
According to the proposal of the new law, medical society may be achieved to 20 million Kenish shields and individual newspapers to one million together with the risk of “extraction from the list” or can be rejected by the official newspaper.
Tribunal also has the right to refuse the ability of the creditor if it is not paid.
According to the letter of Daily Nation, “he is also one trial enough to explore the majority of speaking stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have liquidity impact on the meaning of the chemical "Life blogosphere".
The politicians know that when he's hungry, they can do exactly what they want.
“You don't know what can happen, ” wrote the newspaper of the Nation Mutuma Mathium and described the mine media as a key source of the system of controls and exporting public life.
“When we leave this on policies, they will bring the land to the bankrot and bring us back to the bow and collection,” wrote.
Legislators in Kenya were in the past of public crisis.
In May, they voted to abroad the cups of the National Middle Agency and to renew their payments around 532,000 unsigned shields for monthly, which are so attached to the most highest world.
They have to get together, they know the young Czech.
Most of them, but they don't know what measures
It's still more of the Czechs who gives money to the side.
However, they do not have shapes in the region.
Moreover, the money's side is the same as the Rakushans, which shares a monthly average of 181 euros.
Something more than the Czech, and people in Slovakia.
It is deployed from the investigation group of Erste Savings Barometr in Central and East Europe.
It was also shown that the advantage of officers is improved and two third-term planned to give them more money.
While the Chess is the branch between the officers, in Romania and Serbs, people who share the products still use very small.
For example, at least every second serb is in the case of the investigation.
In the aircraft, the amount of those who share up in a month.
Moreover, each month on the various type of training was raised by thousands to 2.5 thousand corners 26% of responsors, the year is about 5% more.
The average month item in the middle-year comparison, but it was low to 2078 corns.
The biggest hite between the products of the confusion is a pension connection.
This approvals 54 per cent of the Czech, while three years ago, the most favorable way to assess only for 36 percent of people.
In addition, the construction of the staff negotiation, the refund of the past year, has also been expressed in the interests of the investment fund.
You're using only 16 percent of responsibilities, while it was at least fourth people.
The investigation also showed that, although people think of a significant approach, most of them do not know the costs of individual products.
In particular, young people don't know how their money is raised.
In addition, the best understanding of the valuable values of their guarded money has the oldest group of questions, among people over 50 years, it knows 73 per cent of questions.
In international comparison of the Group of Prime Chess leads to use on-line banking, which regularly uses 44 per cent of people.
They follow the Slovakians and Rakushans with 12 per cent.
OSN glorifys new targets to fight with poor
The Organization of the United Nations begins to work in a new file of objectives which replace the development targets of thousands of years (MDG), which were carried out for 12 years for the purpose of coordination with the world's poverty.
Before the summary of the United Nations on maintenance development, which began nightly in Riu de Janir, the Australian diplomatic key task played in the "continuable development targets", which have to replace the MDG, which will increase in 2015.
They were limited to the final document that will be approved by the world leaders, including Mrs. Gilliard, during the summit.
The General Secretary of the OSN Mr Ki-mun said that now is the time to “avoid national interests”.
“I am pleased that Member States agreed to launch and prevent the process to carry out the SDG objectives of maintainable development,” said.
The SDG will be established on the progress made in the context of the development targets of thousands of years and will be part of the development programme after 2015.
I will make all the efforts to fulfil the mandate made to me by Member States and to realize our views on the purposes of maintainable development that makes the MDG success.
Security of Mozambique is declined because of the conflict of strong personality
Under Samory Machely, the Mosambic President of the baseholder, thousands of people were gathered in the Centre of Mapput, to call peace passwords on the public demonstrations.
“We want to return peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the Executive Director of Investment Company.
With fear of the future of her country, the business clothed for a tricked post “we need security” in Portugal and was connected in the fourth quarter to the independence of the Namician in the main city.
Two weeks later, almost a day report on conflicts between governments and Renamo, on one of the worst attacks from the peace agreement for over 20 years.
Renamo was once unknownly known, originally supported by the White Government in Roosea and then the Government of apartheid in South Africa in the framework of the opportunity to destabilisate the independent governments of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition side.
Analysis are convinced that it is impossible to find out the open conflict in the country again, but the recent events have explored frontiers and local investors.
In the railway, the rapid growth economy is because the obstacles of the spreaded branches and the carbon flows on the north area can be brought from the community in several years, such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadark, investment in more than 50 billion dollars.
The Government of Frelimo, the dominant political strength since 1975, and Renamo is condemned by the excessive infringement.
The site Renamo says that the government has chosen the last conflict since 17 September began to attack their members in the Province of Sofala, the traditional bank of the Side Renamo.
The pregnancy attacks of ancient rebels were immediately exhausted when the government forces were attacked on the basis of Renamo and tried to kill Afonsa Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times, the Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The Government commits the execution of the conflicts of Renamo because he's cut off the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to be afraid of the disability.
Mr. Guebuza for French press office AFP in the center said that Mr. Dhlakama had seen himself as a "stress", who wanted to use "Anything of his power remained to prove that the government could establish his own decision."
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to go out of war.
But the worries increased when the word of Mr. Mazangy was cited, that Renamo is departed from the peace agreement from 1992.
The FT list said that he thought that Frelimo wasn't respecting the agreement.
“ Our goal is to come back to work, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazang.
The previous conversations between these parties have been made to reduce inflation between these parties, increasingly increasingly, in this year, just a little.
It's a shirt between two large persons (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said to the Lector on the Open University and on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
No one of them is a good delegator and no one of them is prepared to make necessary steps.
The Renamo page, which has made the optional changes, has already been stated that it would fight the Community options planned on November.
The elections of the President and Parliament are planned for the next year.
Some comments interpreted the use of force as a trial of complaining to receive from the Government of Equity and Financial Expenditure.
The election part of Renamo is reduced since 1992, while the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was based on the old member of Renamo, according to the expectation of its position in choices better.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – the next year the second functional period – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"I don't want the democratic system more sides, doesn't want transparency choices, doesn't want peace because they don't want to leave the president's office," said Mazanga.
It's not aware of how Renamo has the possibilities, but he has made the reverse terrorist attacks on police stations and on the key streets between the north and the south.
The majority of the pockets arrived in the Province of Sofala, which is even a few hundred miles away from the main city of Maputo, but where Beira is, a place in which the worthy company, including the Rio Tinto and Vale, on their export.
In June, Rio stopped a week of fertilization, when Renamo said that he was struck on this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to ask if Renamo repairs his threat.
Renamo wanted to “watch the international community that the situation in Mosambique is not good, ” said Mazanga.
It is not able to increase frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company of Mediacoop, and many people also have fear of corruption, a short time of development and recent rate.
“The people think that the responsibility for the future of the country is an explicit government and President and that he must be the one who finds the solutions of the problems,” says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says that people just want stability.
“There doesn't interest anybody nor Renamo nor Frelimo, people only want peace again, they want free access on the streets," says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “modeles for life, ” says the author.
The advice of Thor can show that “the force of power can not be equal to the intelligence of the ability, ” while the artificial lengements decline how important it is to have dream.
The large part of the months would “for education in school was to be too amazing until it was too scanish and in some cases to be too increasing,” said Crossley-Holland, which agrees to the ultimate choice of the corresponding age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creatures are already part of education," he said.
I took this plan for 20 years.
He added that “offensively teaching” cars and teachers are in the famous history with the “consulting” message for children as a “reporter”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated epos Beowulf from English, who also writes the Norwegian letters (Penguin Book) and the British national bathrooms, says: "You can have good ideas, but you will do better if you leave them for yourself."
The largest difference between the adult author for adults and adult authors who sing for children is needed for some hope.
Not even that everything must be unjusted or finished by happy, but it must be natural for good and evil.
And he must be conscious; separated through history, not openly established.
The old truth is to show it better than to describe.
The Brünn Star takes visitors to the universe in a new digitary
On the first view, it is obviously that the great planetaire has changed for the last half of the year.
There's a new plane here, visitors can be busy in new agreed seats and on their heads came a projection desktop on average of 17 meters in the face of the cup from the American Spitz company.
In the middle of the sale is his most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To be perfect, there are other smaller projectors after the hall.
Another important part of the entire device is hidden behind the sale walls.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the brann stars of Jiri-Andschake.
The computer will ensure that the image of some projectors should not be covered, but he'll give a full room.
"The shipment of computers is thirty-fourty times higher than in classic personal computers," supported the technology from the star Thomas Fladick.
Digitarium will be able to tried immediately realistic and plastic models of night clouds, human body or the ocean day.
Divines are so precious in the middle of the universe or the brain of humans.
Another similar device is closer in Varshah or Hamburg.
The Star Leader plans in the salary to refuse the buyed orders and its own creation.
Since the Sabbath, two sorts are on the program.
The first name is Astronaut and is defined for adults.
People in it will be called on the train of cosmonauts, run into the universe, turn to the center, and then see how astronauts are in the cosmos.
The second order is for children and he's named Couzel Auses - Caluoka'hina.
Reports the story of the assault, whose pestrobar citizens lived in peaceful life until the time when it came to the explosion of a delicious supply.
The entire digitarian has been over 50 million corners, which have been payed overwhelmed by the Ministry of School.
In smaller parts, the city of Brno and the star from its budget.
The projecting desktop was ten million corners, projector twelve million.
"The rest of the audiovisual technology and computers," explained the soul.
The digital installation followed after the rebuilding of the whole building that the star passed two years ago.
According to the Director of the Spirit, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could have arrived to the end of the year.
We studied 11 TISIC INZERATIONS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November, the analyzed over 11 thousand inserted workplaces, from 4300 of them was published in the day pressure and 6800 inzerts (62 per cent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore the most important media for the publication of the employment.
In 2005, when the investigation was first achieved, he decreed 26 percent.
In the last two shirts (2007, 2010), 60 per cent remained.
The inheritance of work options in itself according to the analysis of significant measures reflects the current situation on the work market.
For example, it may be easy to compare the number of public insertions in economic prosperity and economic crisis during the period.
For example, in 2007, it was published at least 25 900 inzerts in the same monitoring period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The Internet's employment menu is oriented on more use, especially a more qualified professional group.
Instead of this employment offer in the day pressure, the larger spectrum of the profession, including those employees, has carried out the author of Paullina City analysis.
The performance of the selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the primary locations of the managers and managers, business managers, programmers and financial experts were taken.
The position of the programmers or leaders of small companies was figured only on the Internet.
In the day of pressure, the part of these famous professionals is very smaller, even though the greater implementation is particularly obedient and professional professional.
The most part of the requirements of employees expressed by incentive offers are, of course, training.
To the next observed area, the knowledge of stranger languages, especially English.
In the day of pressure, the requirement for the knowledge of the external language indicated in three percent of insertion, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two per cent of the employees required a active knowledge of two external languages.
In 40 per cent of inherent inheritance (in the day pressure in 11 per cent, on the Internet in 57 per cent).
The practice in the area was required in 54 per cent of insertion.
Prefix requirements are totally associated with qualified profiles.
It is particularly about leadership products and other managers.
In professional professions, especially on mechanics and manufacturers or manufacturers and manufacturers of food products or electrical equipment, the author of Jiří Tillner was added.
In half of their inserts, employees also provide the requirements for the properties and the performance of the cases.
As most often required in the insertion in the first place, the communicative abilitys have already appeared.
Other employees require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, self-sufficientness, responsibility, organizational capacity and compatibility.
Ben Greenman: Decades of New Yorker's feedback: New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is a location where it was born only comical exhaustion in America: at least a hundred years ago, Frank Fray, who worked as president of the citizens in the Divade Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to communicate with the gathered people to speak the method of conversation.
Fayova innovation was expanded in years, the most recently through the New York Festival.
The festival based and governed by Caroline Hirscho, a funder of a single office of Carolines, celebrates its ten-year-year-old years – together with more than 60 presentations in small clubs and great wonders.
“ Most of these titles appeared in Carolines, and it was successful that they are too big than to play in the club, ” said Hirsch.
This festival we have created as a possibility of working with them.
The airport event includes the exhibition of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mahera, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (see for heroes), a musically co-medial property presentation in Madison Square Garden, including other Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival has expanded, the world has also been developed.
A number of aeroplanes participants have come from non-traditional channels, such as shows in small vocational or TV companys, such as Comdy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has grown up with his site (the pitching "League" on fantastic-fotball theme on FXX) and now he has its own co-medial show on the Comdy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member as a program "Saturday night living", so "Parks and recreation", but the most rapidly exclaimed the wide video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (moshed Marcel in boats).
Like Kroll, as Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognised voices (sirly pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a serious, rarely interviewed W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralised world of America.
One of the largest feeds will be talking: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a single comic, but he became a successful television and movie register, as well as the non-official community history.
From 2005 to 2007, he ordered the TV Land show named "Sit down comdy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is finished in Town Hall in the Manhattan Center.
“ This city is decisively in the DNA of the whole Larry's work, ” said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he's sometimes walking in the street between two buildings and says, "Home, if I'm coming for all money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of the price was cut down for 96 dollars for the barl
The price of eggs in the fifth continued, as the fear of high resources showed the report that showed the strengthening of the Chinese manufacturer sector for energy.
The American currency indicator for prosinc additives during the late morning, the European electronic trade in the New York Trade Business was 14 cents for 96,24 dollars for the bar.

The Ministry for Energy in the Mediterranean announced that the American resources have increased over 4,1 million barls last week.
In five weeks, the resources increased more than 25 million barls.
However, in the fifth of the two reports of the Chinese production came to the greater question showing growth in the activities.
This indicates that the economic recovery of China would be raised after the growth of two severe decades in the third quarter of 7,8 per cent.
Ropa Brent, the indicator for international rope used also by American rafinery, fell on the International Trade City in London at 26 cents for $108.58 for the barl.
That's not, Mr. Haschk.
We have the only opportunity to tell the policies that it is not.
It's needed to take a pressure that Martin Haschek should be saved all the political functions and leave the post-mandate.
Any other solutions reduces political cultures that are already so amazing.
Martin Hashek is forbidden by the promise that he gave, but everyone and policy must be particularly known to the results of the promise and to consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that has the policy (Mr. Babiš has also the mental, however, the question is, whether it is a policy).
The self-based lying program is incredible.
It's not forgetted in the policy, it's going to go away in the policy.
Mr. Haschku, if you think that's good with this country (and your fresh statement states me in this case, if you did not just - here you see how it is lying), you will leave the policy yourself as a guy.
But your people will be accepted as an excuse of a man who made a mistake and put his responsibility for her.
In a case, you will be considered as an unexpected difficulties that you can't believe in words or acts.
You want to be hungry to be a false man or a food sheet.
Maybe you think it's wrong when I'm honoring you only, but you're the leader and they're just the mental sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying for a minute to lock your ears, overcome the powers, get out of the shoes, and then shoot again, but they're taking party or subtracts.
You, I'm back, in your eyes, alpha self, so do it.
Take responsibility and leave the policy.
The Court has blocked the Regulation on the procedure for the breakdown and search of the police department in the NY
The federal Court of Justice on the fourth day, the court regulation required amendments in the schedule and investigation of persons in New York and the Court of Justice for case.
The second American Revocation Court said that the decision of the judge Shiry Scheindlin will be submitted until the decision of the revoking which the city has been given.
The Court in August decided that the City was disappeared by the Office so that it had implemented its programme for the setting and question of people.
The city of its conclusions and its correct Regulation has concluded, including the decision to attach attention to the police department, helping to change its procedures and its school programme associated with them.
The Court of Revocation has listed to the arguments for the requested delegation.
The Court of Revocation said that the court should be revoked from the case because it had been fulfilled in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that as the court did not come out according to the requirement of submission, partly because of the series of conversations with the media and the public declaration that openly reacted to the court criticism.
Judge decided that the police officers had violated the national rights of the decades when they had mistaked the black and the Spanish in the framework of their schedule and search for persons.
She decided an independent observation to observe the main changes including reforms in procedures, education and surveillance, and to establish the execution of the pilot program for the testing of cameras carried out on the body in some areas where it is the most frequent stop of persons.
In August of New York, the end of the names and the address of people whose cases were rejected after police search.
The extern reason of the city's call is planned at times after 14 March 2014.
The interruption and search of persons criticized a number of citizens protection rights.
In a certain form there is an interruption and search of persons almost a number of decades, but the independent starch Michaela Bloomberga had dramatically grown into the record number 684 330 in 2011, in most cases, he had been in black and Spain.
In 2004, four men who were all among the minors, the inquiry that occurred in the case of group accidents.
The changes of the system of discharge and investigation of the police department in the NY states that changes will end wrong practices, increase confidentiality and efficiency of the police congregation and can affect how these procedures are used by other police divisions.
The opponents say that the changes reduce the police moral, but not the crime, and that it is deceived by money, but it will not be a larger problem when the police congregation is under button after the last decade reduced its number of thousands of people.
The Court noted that it was not completed the practice of stoping and searching persons who were essential, but reformed the way the police section was introduced in the NYPD.
Five purchases centres are concerned with lower visits
It describes the data of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the fresh gods, the public of the Trade Centre of Krakov is opened, the 19th of the fresh purchase centre.
There are now 90 large business centres in the CRR.
The unfortunate exercise is about about about 20% increasingly large and large center.
The main problems are independently large center in the local and bad layouts, so too much father or incompatible and incompatible and uncompatible passenger coordination, accidentally dead center," Michal Sotak reported from Cushman & Wakefield company.
Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi also, according to the leadership of small commercial diseases, is almost five of the business centers concerned with a lower visit.
In the middle of the main reasons, the low accessibility of the local citizens or the transition of the market in the place given.
Some projects were opened almost completely, but their results were mainly income.
Today, the customers have any concert and no recommendations to change their purchase normality.
The new business center must be trying to try more to 'that' his clients on new marks, happy, services and marketing actions," added Samadi.
The contents of the purchase center is generally stabil, even in some centres, because the pronunciators were in a crisis able to cut out from a reward and provoke some units.
"It's true that in the last time, some projects that are not full and average contents are so reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Santawk in Olamozia)," added Sotak.
The business center opened in the past two years has been on the market according to Sylvie Samadi very short.
The market location for new projects exists.
The number of appropriate places for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Praia, we see the space for the establishment of a project that would serve the citizens of Praha 6.
On the market, it is certainly a space for the establishment of small local projects, such as 'convince centres', which are based on the purchases and services of the day needs for residence in the middle area," Samadi.
It is also in accordance with Sotata, a place for another purchase centre on the Tumbian market.
And as for the small 'observed' center, as for large projects in Praia, or in the middle of large projects, or in regional cities.
"The cities like Kladno, the Czech Budajovice, Brno or Plzeň have space for further growth," added Sotak.
In Praia, the space for prepared trade center on the Victoria City, they still have the clear potential of the streets on the Pilkopa and Vaclova.
"Intensively, the expansion of the park report that allows businessmans to cover and expansion in smaller cities for a good and running costs, space also is still in some local places for smaller or local buy center, respectively their rebuilding as such as the rebuilding of business houses of Press, which makes good location," added Dita Kubank from DT.
In the present time, 90 modern purchase centres are located with more than 2,2 million meters of four-quarters-increasing areas.
The fourth of all these buy centers are located in Praia.
In the middle of 20 largest purchases centres, for the number of revengers, nine in Praia, is exposed from the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of purchases parks, the CHR is under the average EU, compared to the values of the United Kingdom and France, the Czech is about about 50 meters of fourth and thousands of citizens.
Coulson was buried in the phone to check a tip
The famous news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson used the methods of “employment in the phone, monitoring and confrontation” to confirm the dual tip of the relationship to which the next Minister Charles Clarke should be introduced.
The State Deputy Andrew Edis in the Court of Old Bailey said that the news of the World had been held in May 2005 a false report that Clarke had seen his “atractive special advice” to Hannah Pawlby.
The newspapers confirmed the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to enter the vote box of Paulby and go to her private, but in the court, Coulson also called her and left her vote messages.
“The State Deputy indicates that Mr. Coulson, who is now the NewW editor, is not a man who stands before the house and hopes that people are outside but a man who loves his story to see what they say,” said Edis.
He said that NotW news were using three ways of study of story: reviewing in phone, monitoring and confrontation.
The editor is personally inserted in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the other, looking, he needs to know about her.
What's the first?
Do you know how to get up to the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he knows."
The famous relationship in which Clarke was introduced was first arrested by the news report of NotW when the resource that was sexually interested in Mrs. Paulby was said: "If you lose time, this is with Charles."
The record of voting reports related to her phone at at least three opportunities was received in Mulcairo's house in August 2006.
The researchers also found records in the computer of the private investigator where Mrs. Paulby and her sister were marked as "Projects".
While Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, she received anonymous phone calls in which they were requested information about Paulby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile the old main report Neville Thurlbeck and the old report James Weatherup visited the movement of Mrs. Pawlby.
Coulson left her on June 18, 2005 a vote report in which he told her: “I got a story that we're going to leave tomorrow, and I'd like to talk to Charles. ”
Mr Edis says that Coulson's introduction in the history was in accordance with the same model as with other significant persons, among whom the former Minister inside David Blunckett.
In the Court on April, Coulson had stated that Mr. Blunketta was confronted by a loving relationship with a widow, while he saw Rebecca Brooks, who was then led to.
Coulson and Brooks have broken together with other persons in order to build the phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have been authorised to buy in the phone.
The NSA department increases the Community monitoring paranoi from the State parties
One of the peaceful day to the end of August of the German police officer, the American consulary office in Frankfurt, the main city of German economy.
At the view of the Community Agency for the protection of the Station (BfV), German home of the reporting Agency, the mission was to prepare photographs of the United States pre-presentatives, which are located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV Office hoped that it would be able to identify the existence of hearing antenna, and this action has started in Berlin the exchange of opinions between the United States and German Minister.
James Clapper, the American director of the national community, in September, reiterated that the United States did not use their frontier transport options, “as to cut the trade secrets of the foreign company in the efforts of American society and to send their international competitive capacity or to increase their growth”.
But since Edward Snowden, who was a cooperator, began to decline his price collection from the secret monitoring of the United States, the European governments and the primary companies, if they have to believe the words of the director.
After reporting that the United States National Security Agency had carried up the Spionship in Brazil and received access to data with which the American clouds providers, including Google and Yahoo, have received a global paranoia on the monitoring of new measures.
The last cup came out with the phone of Angely Merkel's office phone may have been listen to ten years.
If it may be the most powerful person in Europe, they are certain potential terms and primary businessmen.
Snowden considered intensive cooperation between American public services and society.
I would say that it might be that these data are used to be used for each other.
“The Germany has to be exhausted,” said Oliver Greun, President of the BITMi company, which is a small and central IT company in Germany.
According to the investigation referred to in June of the EC Council Service, German society are convinced that, in the case of industrial speed and data, the United States presents the same risk as China.
However, in the whole document, Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence that the United States have submitted the trade secrets of the foreign company with their own company.
Politicals stated that the EU had no specific capacity in the IT and the Internet, and that it had to be tried to limit its compliance in the United States:
The former businessmen are in the case of the box.
From the German Parliament, the voices are called that we should produce the German Google.
I can just shut up the eyes, and I can't open them a little while...
It's not a path, says Hasso Plattner, President of German software company of SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he had not left him to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is involved from the air from the car and the farmer.
It's all outside the IT.
The range and technical training of the American Spionage Agencies from Snowden is for some companies that followed that China is the largest threat of monitoring.
It is established a great resistance in the cloud calculation technique, where European representatives in the largest field realized that the data stored in the United States fall under the jurisdiction, and therefore they are potentially vulnerable.
According to the investigation of the trade community Cloud Security Alliance cca 10 per cent of the non-American members after the United States Prism for the data payment was interrupted to use a cloud provider in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the general directors of the SAP, says: "We have a new question for the reporters who haven't been here for a year ago - where are my data stored and you can guarantee that the jurisdictions will remain physically?"
Many German higher workers argued that the last reports are only confirming what they already knew: that powerful States want to decline their most precious secretity and the data must be protected for each price.
It's not surprised.
It's always done.
Curt Bock, the General Director of the Agrochemic Company of BASF, has not changed it in the present debate.
The Americans carry on us a spione on business and industrial level, as we lead a spione on them because they are in our national interest to protect our businesses.
The officers of the officers are generally not able to claim to the promotions that have done to not offer the exploitation of the exploitation.
In the case of large companies, there is a long time reminder that you take a hard USB memory disk in the hotel room, or leave unsaved notebook in the hotel room is at least unknown.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the Audi automobile representative, says that many years are a regular practice to collect mobile phones before the meeting, so that it is not possible to be used as an audit device.
The German Office of BfV leaders will advise to assess whether they do not use a simple mobile phone for risk that smart phones can be used.
The forward mobile phones will go out later.
However, it is afraid that small and medium businesses will continue to take care of hackership and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are in their specific areas of human representatives of the global market.
“The small and central companies are often missing experiences, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect the secrets of business against the unautorised access”, warns in his BfV report.
The United States warns its own company before the economic spiones from other countries.
According to the list of Washington post American documents National Intelligence Estimate, the Russian and Israel in the second series of trusters who are inhacker activities for economic reports, and that is now for China.
Members of the Council in Germany's non-risic company concluded that, if it is about economic speed, "the most worse France."
Bernard Squarcini, was the head of the French internal official DCRI, this month in one of the talks, said: “The services are very well known that all the countries, even if they cooperate in fight against terrorism, they take spionship on their partners.”
The parents of the unbelievable boy of Georgia who died in a special accident, believe that he was murdered
The parents of the unbelievable boy in Georgia, whose body was found in the middle of his middle school, believed that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer in the fourth century.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdost City in Georgia, was found in the 11th January in the steady officers in the middle school where he walked.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a fame, but the family of the seventeenth-year-year-old boy refuses it.
“There are only convinced that their son was murdered, ” said FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, who acts in Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died as he told the sheriff.
“They are convinced that it reverses logic, physical laws, and also healthy understanding,” said Crump.
They think that he has to do what really happened to protect a person responsible for their son’s death.
“ How often his son sent to school, and he returned to them to the dead, ” said he.
The State Manager Michael Moore in the fourth day said he's leaving a regular investigation of Johnson's death, and noticed that several key questions were not responded.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the consequence of crime?
He published Moore on the print conference on Friday.
I'll see the fact that they'll bring me anywhere.
My goal is to find the truth.
"I am the opinion that there is enough base for regular research," said he.
Moore told the newspapers that the original piece stated that Johnson died in the consequence of the "pool depression".
However, the second piece, according to Moore, brought another cause to death.
“ There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,” said he.
Moore added that if in the case of Johnson's death, the proof of evidence to investigate a criminal action or to disappear citizen laws, the FBI requests and its executions.
The officer officer officer from Lowndes officer was not available immediately on April.
The judge of South Georgia in the middle of the officers ordered to provide all videos from the monitoring cameras who were looking at the investigators.
Young parents hope that the video records will contain a road of leaders to remove their son's dead.
The CDC Centre has been issued for schools in respect of allergies in children
In the Centre for prevention and control of diseases (CDC), a guide file provided for children's allergies for food in school.
It is the first file of such directives that the United States government has carried out, and it is because of the number of children of school age that suffers allergies for food.
One of 20 children in the United States has allergies for food.
The CDC Centre discovered that the alergies for food in the children were aged between 1997 and 2007 to 18 per cent.
The Directives contain information for schools on how the teacher congregation and the persons know about children's allergies on food and how to respond to allergic reactions if possible.
Also, schools recommended to have adrenalin – most often uses the automatic EpiPen tag injector – to be able to respond to potentially dangerous life.
The State legislation authorities recently updated rules that allowed schools to facilitate adrenal singleness.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms found in conversation with children who have allergic reactions.
The kid can say, "It's like someone writes me in the language," "I feel I'm on the language of the guys" or "He tests my language."
Intersexual children parents can choose “increasing heads”
Germany became the first European country, which recognizes the third head of children born with the unbelievable structure.
The new children will not be attached anymore to a man or to a woman's head.
The new law from parents is not required to bring any head to such children, and allow them to carry the heads as “unspecified ” or“ unspecified”.
The purpose of the law is to stop pressing parents to make sure their child will decide for operations for the purpose of the definition of the head, and to fight the discrimination of those who are intersexual.
A intersexual person in the BBC after many years said, "I'm no man nor woman."
I'll stay a witched doctor, able and detected.
It seems that each year of 2000 children are born one who is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, part of the groups of almost 60 realities that fall into the diagnosis of the disaster development, a suspicious terms for those who have a typical chromosomes, hair-shirts (vailing or varlate) or usually unexpected genetaly.
Intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
The definition of the head is not yet comprehensive, but most of the experts in the United States says that if they cannot determine heads, it is better to use the best available information and to determine them to be expected and to monitor psychological and physical development child until the operation is done.
The New York Psychiatric Dr. Jack Drecher, who is specialized on the problems with the definition of the head, said that the new German law “seems like a good thing. ”
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
“ Some people are in a worried situation that requires operations, but in most children it is not so," said.
The definition of heading can be carried out without operation and then it can wait for how identity is expired.
The knowledge of the child’s famous conscience is not too perfect.
Nobody can answer the question why it's going to happen.
It's like a condemnation, why some people are homosexual.
The report presented to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgeneral people, because their status is not based on heads but on their biological construction that is not explicitly nor male nor female, but typically involves both and cannot be defined as no one of them.
These characteristics may be shown in secondary headquarters, such as a sval rate, hair rate, plots and stage, in primary sexual characteristics such as multiple organisations and main equipment, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides a view to the discrimination that uses intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, as well as the level of distortion, violence and proposals.
The boys who don't respond to any head now have a special camp now.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark in officials of men, women or “the third head”.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australia, became the first recognised “invisible” person in June, when she won a judicial challenge to leave the status of the "insurance" head.
According to the Ministry within shall have German passes except M (M) and F (Man) and the third mark, X, and it will be for intersexual persons.
In the neighborhood France, the report on France is still contrary.
In 2011, the decades of French lawyers from this strong Catholic country subscribed a piece for “theory of heading” from school students.
The American websites of Catholic online have also been limited to the German law and wrote: “In the way the world is attached to the new state when it takes a question of choices, but the sexual activity of niv, we will turn two other civilization pilars.”
A mother who was born from Maryland also said to Baby’s area that she would like to see children's head at birth.
“ Parentity alone is stressed and without any other limits, especially if you don’t know the heads of your child, ” she expressed for the web pages relating to the parents’ care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with as a man as a woman's head called hermafrid, and that's according to the looking Greek who had two heads.
And about ten years, the medical community thought that the head was something like a table that could be deleted and rebuild again.
But now many of them are surprising the ethical basis of operation with that the comprehensibility is complex, and the doctors may sometimes decide wrong because they don't know how children will feel when they grow.
“In half of the 20th century, the psychiatric preparation was called," said Drecher.
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatric, but the chirurg.
The surveying theory about how to come with children with unsigned head, Dr. John Money was submitted to the University of Johnse Hopkins, who had considered that the head is understood.
He created a new equipment “the main competence” and argumented that social reasons and environment – as parents grew up their child – they had exploited children's genes and hormones and made the child without being identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case from 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became sportly.
To the parents, whose penis was healed because of the wrong circumcision, he recommended that their child should be completely exposed, removed his warrants and rescued him as a girl.
“ The media presented this case as a successful change, but the reality was different, ” said Drecher.
When a kid was 15, he left her back to the boy and married her wife.
However, in 38 years he was murdered.
Drecher said that some doctors “use these models” added to day.
But in the 90s, with the Internet's coming, the overliving of these operations found “behaviour with the results”.
It was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with men's chromosomes, but the unbelievable equipment.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man could never live “happily life. ”
And so short after his birth in 1976, Bruce was remotely removed external authorities and warlat and was rescued as a girl.
In 12 years he got women hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but I was very hard to ask it.
In 18, it was sent to the gas plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was okay, he asked medical records.
What he found was terrified.
I was sterilized after the birth, and no one told me anything.
Bruce was born with the exploitation of heads (DSD), which was struggled by the body to produce sufficient quantity of teststerone to be directly issued by its main equipment.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to a man, he took the dose of the testestrone and left to remove the pops,
The operation made his unfaithfulness.
Today, there are others in the organization called Interface Project and are trying to normalize the impression of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (including information choices) with the seat in California, is concerned that the German law “requestly calls to treat and stigmats”.
“More activities are concerned that German law will encouraging parents to make rapid decisions and to choose for the child ‘inurious’,” said.
We're afraid that it's going to make it to intervention.
We think it's better to share men or women's heads and then wait.
But we don't know how the law finally examinas, so all we can do is speculation.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because it “allows the adult to choose to be attached to the third head.”
“The adults should be able to make the right of their own decision,” she said.
The German law is able to add it to her when he was born.
It's a battle that a little child wouldn't have their own in this moment.
When they grow, they can make their own body decision.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a railway of Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a defenced development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law is “instructing authority” to parents, as well as children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with men's chromosomes, but DSD is called syndrome inadequate on anthrogeny.
Because her androgen recipes are vacuum, Katie's women's charts were developed.
He's a vagina, but he's not a job and a vagina.
Now, Katie is led to 29 years old and in the university of Pennsylvania works as a spectacular at the child psychiatry.
Although it is unborn, it hopes that parents will be made by adoption or replacement.
“ The law gives the parents a certain space to not be successful with their decisions, ” said Baratz.
It gives them the time to carry out certain tests and think about it and gives them the time before they write “man ” or“ wife. ”
In this regard, it's all right, you save and love it.
You have a wonderful child and you're glad of it.
You don't have to quickly go with the operation that's not back.
“It makes the opportunity to introduce the decision and the child and takes the courage of the parents, because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what my head is more, and that's a great thing.
It gives the child the right to make his own decision.
The officer pulled the whole house of benzine: he struck that he burned him with his own family!
The worm has increased, fear has declined.
The man began to worry that the whole house was burning.
Therefore, all available police spectacles in the area, such as one of the young Boleslaws, and the unit of the congregation of good hazards.
He also arrived a police officer who tried to talk to the men to his irrational behavior.
The man's still threatened that he's burning the house.
She had to go home so she had to put the ground unit that a man deceived and broke.
Then Agresor finished a investigation in a young hospital, since he was transferred to an anti-alcohol office.
Finally, the Hassicians laughed a sorbent that later calm.
In addition, all home animals were saved from the house.
He didn't give a man to the police officer. He's looking after him.
Message: The campaign was considered to change Biden for Hillara Clinton
The nearest President Baracka Obama, according to the New York Times list, secretly considered to replace the candidate from 2012 Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton.
This department is the most significant unexpected unexpected books on campaign 2012 from Mark Halperina and John Heilemanna “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the books arrived and announced on the fourth evening that the President of the High Collaborators had organised the intensive group meetings and investigations in the end of 2011 to reveal whether Biden's rescue would help to survive the bread hope for the Revolution.
According to the National-Politic Reporter for Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a valid record of the officers inside the campaign and in the White House, name of the former officer of Bill Daley's White house, to measure the effect on choices should be moved by the former minister of Clinton at the post of Vice-Presidents.
Possible change was increasingly increasing secretity in the framework of the campaign infrastructures and within the official work.
Only some of the neighborest Presidents, including Daley, the former boss of Obamo's campaign Jim Messin and the older counselors in the White house David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that this change was considered.
The book "Double down" says that Daley was a representative of attempting to replace Biden, in the middle of their neighborhood relationship, and it was until they finally decided to do this tattoo when the data showed that Clinton's adding to the candidate would not be "Obamo's chance would not be exceedingly increased."
In conversation with Martin Daley confirmed that the administrative really considered Biden Clinton's replacement.
“ Intensively, I tried a whole number of things and this was one of them, ” said Daley.
You don't forget that the president had a nice view in that time, so we said, "Christpane, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as “incidental career”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for renewing was made a lot of investment to find whether this tax was paid in the options.
“In campaigns there are no such money for choices and quality research if something really does not really mean,” said Martin on AC360.
But it is not clear if Obama knew that his team considers this exchange.
Martin said to the CNN that Daley asked if his boss knew about this potential cutting cart.
While Daley said he doesn't think that the president’s potential changes “because knowledge, ” the former officer recognised that he was“ possible ” that Obama knew about that.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not definitely answer the question if the political sand has received to Obam on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the investigation about Biden's excuse from the candidate.
“ Maybe, ” answered Martin.
Fantastic smoke that lights in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first smoking that lights in the dark – for the use of medudes.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescenous properties of this marine animal and developed lighter balls.
It came to the idea when he reading a fine medude, and persuaded a scientist in China to make chemically a white chemical that makes lighting.
This smoking reacts with the language of consumption – increases the pH hazard in the white and results on its basis.
Chris says that it's the light when he's reacting with your mouth's twice, and that's why whatever you're leaving, it's clearer.
Charlie, the lick me I'm delicious's officer, says: "I'm amazing me, I'm amazing," says, "It's a wonderful substance, but if it's about production, we're at the beginning, so you're going to get 2 g of this substance for 200 GBP."
Whitecockin, which we use in the illness, reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So, as your mouth bears the white cycle, the hot pH is higher and the crazy begins to shut up.
We tested her during several last months, and it seems to be a great idea for the celebration of Halloween, because it makes this fantastic amazing effect.
It's probably the oldest shit that I've ever made, because the lighting of the medus is four times better than the gold.
And then every coffee stays about 140 GBP.
But the poor.
Charlie's experimental company with the seat in Bristol is known for his non-traditional drinks, shirts, shirts, and gold lists.
His other product must be more ambitional.
She says: "I would really like to produce an invisible destruction."
In my basic basis, it's impossible because of the light of the ice cristalls that's dead, but I'm counting to find some way as to do it.
The fuel uses the fluorescenous properties of meduses, aware of Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to the number
When I was small, Halloween was magic.
With my sister, we could eat sweetness, staying long up and bringing up to the neighbors in the surface.
I'm feeling I've been cut off today.
Two years later, the sugar has not appeared in my apartment, and this year is probably not different.
However, statistics show that I am, if it's about Halloween, the black sheep.
According to the State little trade Federation (NRF), this year will celebrate Halloween most of the Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and loss the total of $6,9 billion for favour, cost and cost.
But everybody shows happy about Halloween, they're trends.
According to NRF, it is expected that 6,9 billion of lost dollars will be $1,2 billion to costs.
This year is the last shooting of sex modes under objects.
Sexy has no longer to be women; sexy can also be food as pizza, hamburger and mrkev.
If it's about a man, I'm expecting that we'll see a lot of zombies through the cause of the dead people, and I'm sure the universe men of Daft Punk will get it for years to our channels in Instagram.
According to Google companies, they are the most precious zombies, Batman, pirates and chairmans.
I imagine it's nothing wrong about it, walking after the tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs and we were not the only one.
In fact, Americans, according to NRF, will lose 330 million dollars this year for the costs for animal love.
So he'll see a lot of playing dogs.
If it's fair, we're not gonna lose time.
According to the Nilsen American company, $1.9 billion will lose.
It's a range of 300 million kg tables of Hershey, leaders, sweetness of Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark.
This is a wonderful report for 41 million colleagues who are able to overcome our fourth.
In fact, we're buying Halloween, and you don't believe and convince, 45 million kg chocolate.
The only thing we don't want are cookers, and however, according to the National Association of Sugaren around Halloween is sold at least 16,000 tons.
It's like 9 billion of a single cooker bonbons.
That's the secret I've never discovered.
Nothing for Halloween is more typical than horrible houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" (Hrrosa behind the walls, which is outside real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (yekot, riv) and "The house of shock" (the house of shock).
In fact, there are in the United States officially $1200 horrible houses, which have a $500 million in the United States, which includes the wonderful photos you're making fears and your friends on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like, looks a picture and adds a comment as "beauty face".
And finally a little bit about the skins.
Now when we were small, Charlie Brown presented us a big dining (Great Pumpkin) and the solution of giant lights is something like the tree to do it from a little bitch.
Congratulations for us the tend of "being in the dining" started by the Pinterest app once a lone, so most of us increased that we were resolved instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the Agency for the counting of people in the United States, the United States will lose about $106 million.
The dining lamp with a mixed plane on your preceding currency is probably from Illinois, where this year grows 245 000 tonnes of dining.
If you take something extra, call Timor and Susan Mathisdon from Napa in California and try to resolve their rings at least one ton.

Blacksenberg: Two years ago, we have the time options here
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg waits for a short time option.
Week after the last conversation for the currently talk, but he said that there is no other east, and every government has come from the vote of the past fiveth and the sabbath is unable to sleep.
"This can't hold long," said Karel Schwarzenberg with that the time of life that starts the choice period is amounted to two years.
"I think it's a bit more exhaustive decision."
In addition, the President TOP 09 does not admit that his side could still lose the floor as a fly (in contrast to 2010, the circle of 300 thousand votes came).
Schwarzenberg describes that if it was clear for two months that will be the timely choices, it will send the ANO 2011 Andreje Babiš.
In the case of the Blackenberg, Baby's gonna lose.
Turbulent situation in CSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after the late meeting of the parties, announced that in social democracy, he remains, or Michal Haschek, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leaders of the Democratic Sites as small boys go back to the head of the State to allow them to turn back to the side."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was more wise and smarter."
"Because I didn't see something so unexpectedly in the life," added the President TOP 09.
And by the direction to the President Zeman (which he had warned against the President), he said, "The role of the head of the State is clear: He wants to strengthen that side."
The first law has already submitted TOP 09.
What was the most surprised choice for you personally?
TOP 09 has already submitted its first proposals of laws in Snimovn formally, except for other Farm's contract records, which were made before the elections of the Scientific Committee, but with the previous elections fell under the table.
The President TOP 09 in the conversation for the currently. It says that such speed is given by "the laws are needed".
On the other hand, TOP 09 wants clearly to prevent the low trials from other sides.
For example, ANO Martin Comarek has committed TOP 09 in the pre-selected battle that the idea of implementing the registry of the contract "extrade" program of ANO.
TOP 09 now uses the smoke - she just rejected the proposal that had already been raised into the second smart reading.
Hasiki units came to save the lost bed that was 15 meters over the country on a dangerous calculation in the stone
The kickspane Ruby escaped after a small car.
Three days later, the prisoner in the stone was lost a man who won the dog.
The Hassiers slow down the wall to save the dogs from a certain death.
The wall was released by food units that received her to be delivered after a certain way, the same was made on a dangerous calculation in the rock of 15 meters over the country.
The nine months cochpany Ruby fled after a small carnage in the week afternoon, and he survived three days until he was not released from the stone in the middle.
His leader Scott Alderson (25) and his friends Becky Hall (20) were in the Steel Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the western and safe service from West Yorkshire.
After he fled, when he arrived into a small disease, the horizon after his lost dog patterns and put excuses on social networks.
In the middle of the 14.15, he saw a spectacular spectacle of Ruby's beast at the calculation of the rock of 15 meters over the country.
Instead, he shocked the technical safe team from the Cleckheaton fire station and held down to free Ruby, and he used to carry him after the rock of transport tattoo for animals.
Andy Clayton's great team's technical manager said, "The Pes was in danger.
He was directly in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and back.
When he was saved, he was totally dead.
Now she's okay.
Then he got the shoes.
It was a very simple exit.
That's what a dog has lost, it's incredible.
Peter Lau's chercher of the technical safe team said: “Ruby had a great luck during his escape.”
It was the possibility that it would be very serious or serious.
Ruby was carried out to the veterinary to the spectrum, and except the explosion and dehydration were all right.
Mrs. Hallova from Halifax in West Yorkshire said: "I was afraid to see the safe action."
First, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to keep him back in the room.
The veterinary said that if he had been broken too much and cold, he probably would have fallen.
The Hassiers took a great job.
What they did was very serious.
We're a lot of thanks to them. They're all worried.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there."
Hassici were great.
We still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that after 18, Katy Perry wasn't decisive.
During the interview for the Australian speaking order, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song “Old habits die hard” from 2004 had been able to sing fulfilled calls.
Perry said that when she was 18, she was with this rock veteran and he went out after her.
And he added: "This was a long time, and now it is very loved to me."
In the report of Jagger's Fourth (70), the director said that he would deny Cataly Perry's proposals.
The officer said: "It may be a lie with someone else."
Perry was one of the hosting songs (cant) who were found for years on the concert shirt Rolling Stones.
Her new "Prism" album debuted this week on the first place.
George Kerevan: Separated Europe gives the Scotlands to choice
The next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time a warning is shown that the conditions for an independent Scope member in the EU would be its income to Schengen.
That was a reason for the story of pass checks in Berwick and the eighth train of the Hadrian Valley.
The truth is that Strathclyde's news have mentioned the potential economic costs of free move with the rest of Europe, but – as it has been expected – it has not been rejected in the news titles.
Nobody also noted that the EU Member States would take a number of time when they apply their official laws if they apply it to them.
While Scozia is not now in Schengen, the proposal of the continued insolvency would be for Brussels' leather step for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a lot of hard story.
And even so old that it became a copy of the newspaper that “independence means pass controls, ” I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, in this challenge, one interesting thinking is hidden.
Why should it be expected that the independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why to change the London chomout for that brussel, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great military plan to conceal Europe finally.
The impact of the euro crisis is the European project officially dead.
The European participants have the influence of the parts of the public resistance against the EU or the destruction of euros as common measures.
Even in Germany, the European Spanish Side for Germany, based on this year, has come as a result and already in close federal choices, have been used at least five million votes from Bundessag, based on the "the freedom" democracies (the British Liberal Democratics).
At home ground, it was always contrary to the plan to create the federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decision.
The competence of the German and the European Central Bank together with the shipment of the national economy with a common variety have brought many to think that the European project has been too far.
The crisis of the euro is only a little combined with that national governments are economic with a high budget field -- it was only true in the case of Greece.
It is usually about the eura system that blocks its members on the change kurs for German exports, and the German policies want to leave it.
Without the possibility of devaluation of household measures, South Europe is in the territory of home production to resist German disagreement.
The only help is to cover accommodation and public costs – to which Germany chooses.
For the current problems with the budget and change is the deep cause of European small exercise.
Following the "Green" energy policies supported by Brussels – code for the support of French and German funds on consumer costs – the European industry shall pay two times more than the electricity and four times more than the benzine in the United States.
This is a paralyzing accident in the cost area, as we have already seen in the case of Grangamouth.
Neither all payments in the world would not reduce the reduction of the European Petrochemic Industrie of a leather-frue from the United States.
The result is a significant explanation, especially in France, when the EU's highest staff is.
After a political elite in France, the EU had seen as a tool that would keep Germany on the bed and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
But in Berlin, Paris is no longer needed as a proof of political legitimacy and requested his own economic policy in Europe and the refused French economy left his judgment.
Results: The right road of Marine Le Peny, the anti-European National Front, just gained basic additional choices and the government socialism to third place.
The Fronta is now 24% of the most popular side in France – a temporary warning for British labourists that they can not use that the right smoking automatically appears on the left.
How is Le Pen inserted in its new population between the White Working Class?
The European choices in the next year would like to use to create an anti-European block against common change.
If the anti-European parties will be carried out in these choices, which is likely, such blocks can first be dominated in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe that in the respective time, the growth of anti-European feelings and positions against common changes will be killed and the euro will be killed.
The EU is not amounted, but the movement is almost to something more free in the meaning of “Europe (Suvereniens) nations” has already been raised by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of his satellite economy may have a euro, but France and South Europe renew their own changes.
I hope that the Great Britain will be distant from this project and will be involved in the United States.
However, the higher interest in Washington about Tichomora indicates that the British will be left by Atlantic boy.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose the area (in the basis) of the small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – there is the possibility to tell Berlin and Brussels when we have to be.
I imagine that Skotland would be well in the free coordination of Europe for the proposal that he would keep his own change.
Cooperation with other similar countries would be easier in the Infederal Europe of the Netherlands.
In addition, we should take a example from Norway and leave our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – a purchase – the most successful political rate of non-profit measures in Europe, which have gathered greaterly in 2011 by the opposition positions of the labour planning (and implemented) labour officer Alistair Darling and the following coalyce of concerts and liberal democracies.
It would be comfortable if the Scope now calls independence only to adopt sustainable measures described by Berlin and Brussels.
Time pubert: Suddenly
Research showed that Africans and Spains have the puberts before their white grounds.
Physical changes not indicate that the pubert is close
Not indicated that there are hormones or other chemical substances
Officers say that one of the previous puberts can be an epidemia of obsession.
The train of the first pubert is not like the boys.
The CNN Pat Etheridge report is a newspaper who specializes the health of children and family problems.
Does the mother have to worry when her daughters start the growth of the dog and the worms in 7 or 8 years?
At the U.S. Academy of Child Medical Academy this week in Orland in Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively frequently between American girls and represent new standards.
“ A lot of time I tried to make sure my parents that it usually is not a sign of rapid development directly to the full pubert," said Caplowitz
View characters of development, such as the growth of the board, the disasters and the subpairs and the body paths, appear before.
However, for the past 40 years, it was only a small age in the first age.
In the United States, the average age of 12,5 years of age is 12,75 years in 1970.
“When you start to spread the bottom, it is at least two to three years before you get to the first menstruation,” said Caplowitz, which also is the author of the book "Early puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with this Common Problem" (Speaking pubert with a girl: The manufacturer is required for controling this periodic problem)
The best test of how the pubert will continue is time.
It is discussed about what the real beginning of the puberty is activated, but if the growth of the board is introduced by the growth spurter before the 8th age, the girl is considered as “forwardly successful”.
In most cases, the process is late or stopped — what the children can monitor carefully.
The faster growth may be caused to endocrinolog tests for the purpose of exclusion of serious problems, such as the narrow or cysta.
There are treatment procedures that allow time-management and take other consequences: the pre-temporary storage of bones, which can finally be able to stop growth and growth in adults.
Promotions on medicines and hormonal treatment are related to child age, development speed, growth speed and emotional disorder.
The importants are also psychosológic aspects.
In the case of medicines, Caplowitz is careful, but it recognizes that the puberty plants can reduce problems with girls and their feelings that it is different from their superiors.
The understanding is another big problem: parents do not easily want their very young daughters to be menstruated.
“ They're afraid that he can steal or how he will control the hygiene, ” said Caplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter started having a manager in 10 years.
Although there were signs and menstruation, we talked together, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came out of the school, scared and threatened that she was from her first friend.
There are many well known theory about the causes of the previous puberty.
However, there is no further compatible evidence file that hormones are in fat or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in media.
The boys, like girls, get puberts before.
Caplowitz provides an expression that the most important reason is the epidemia of obsession.
In 2001, he helped the study of girls in age from 6 to 9 years, which associates the body pressure with the puberty time.
Another discovery supports this conclusion, but there are many other associated factors.
In this country, Africans and Spanish have a skin to get puberts before their white shoes.
The explanations are different.
Global views seems that the forms of time puberts are affected by all possible from economic conditions to the geno.
Next challenge: Although the boys are already in low age, they have a deceit in their faces and a shame, the trend to the full-bubert of the time puberty is not as clear as it is in the girl.
Other doctors with the American association of children’s medicines (AAP) have added to this subject another compatibility.
Axes and abuses are even normally in horses and bottles.
“We have to be careful, if we have to identify the real phenomenon of the puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a meditrical endocrinolog from the Goryeb child hospital in Morristown in New Jersey.
The parents shouldn’t be able to get from their children’s doctor a comment to talk to their child.
“ It can mean the need to talk to the child before you think," advised Caplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child's probably react well.
The girls who are earlier need to ensure that even when this happens before, this process is a common part of life.
The Convacation of the Economic Role.
Did he have a new job?
Heritach Nadia Convalink (62) appeared in the economic role, and it was a lot to her.
Would the favorite Chess heritage plan to change the profile and get to business in the business?
The Indian Convalink appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and touched a drink there.
I've done this first in my life and it's just done.
Even the boss offered me to buy me, and I could live with a drink.
But I refused to stay with what I'm doing today, in heritage," she consulted Convalink's smiling, who was an host for the twenty-year-year-old functioning of Irish economy.
"I love Irish drink and I'm giving the Irish whiskey here," she broke her hero.
He also appeared to Nadi’s long - year - old friend and friend Paul New.
I'm dead and I can't be mourning in the present new life.
I've been allowed a drink or a man day, and I'm trying to keep it," added herec.
Aeroplane manufacturers are stripped on the breadth of the seat, in the stairs are great prohibitions.
In the middle of the leaders of the aircraft, the second class of seats in a long distance, which this month has caused a large exchange of views on aeroplane show in Dubai.
The proposal of the sport is the largest seats of the long-terms for the economic class, not the same that the aircraft companys are usually previous, but that the added space is the key to the effectiveness of the recent aircrafts offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
The Airbus community called this week to industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm of the large place in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says that they have to decide the air company.
The smoking was established during the period when the manufacturer sold the largest version of its two-motor driving aircraft with the potential record number of assemblies expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
In the way the background part of the aircraft is distributed – particularly whether it is nearly 9 or 10 seats – is the basis of economic implementation procedures for the proposals of new aircraft "mini-jombo".
The Boeing community says that the improved model "777X" will lead 406 people in economic seats larger than 43 cm distributed after 10 in each order.
Airbus Community says that the competitive version of its model A350 will increase 350 people in 46 cm large economic stages based on 9.
The aircrafts are often considering technical questions through the reklame in a good medium.
Airbus is now before the aeroplane show in Dubai, where it expects that 777X gets a review with more than 100 participants is applied directly to publicity.
Recently, he showed what could be started by the new reklame war when he showed the shadows of three persons in the restaurant with the title “Do you want to like it?"
“ Boeing propagates long years in the age of age more than in regional turbovertul airports, ” said the leader’s leadership for Airbus John Leahy.
As the change of the refugees, people are greater, but they sat in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 70s, Boeing 747 jumbo defined a modern continuous air transport, in the oversight of the centuries of the United States Health Health Agency has increased 10 per cent in 40 to 49 years.
According to American health statistics, the average Americans have an American in the 21th century past 100 cm.
Airbus claims that he's raised the concept of seats from 50 years when the average size of the new baptized airport was lower.
Airbus Community states that the research that indicates that the extension has been sitting at 2.5 cm better quality of sleep of 53 per cent.
Boeing dimensions of Airbus' seats are rejected and says that it is not in the power of air producers to decide on how the aircraft carries and rescues.
The Community also says that the investigation shows that the impact in the cabin is involved on more matters than only on the width.
“It's really about to provide aeroplane flexibility and allow them to conduct things that are convinced that they must be successful,” said the officer on Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dedict them what he brings them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the traveling is a larger space for locations, but for the adder is a growth problem that can influence the expenditures.
This section is the commitment in a conventional airport with a reached trade in the next decades for at least 700 billion dollars in the category prices, enough to exceed an American and European export jaw.
As she led in June of Agent Reuters, the seat is exactly the battle between the last aircraft.
Like Airbus, Boeing says that their last proposals of two passenger driving airports are 20% better efficiency than the leader of the market representative in this segment, model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The implementation of Boeing's proceedings includes the comparison of the model 777X design with 10 seats in order and concept 777 with 9 seats in order.
The rate of a single cost is to be contrary to the 10-year-old concept.
“The reason why Boeing dos it is to make more seats, and he made his aircraft more competitively against our products,” said Kevin Keniston, leader for the passengers in the Airbus company for Europe.
On the other hand, the analyticals say that the cabines with 10 seats in order for existing models 777 are in accordance with that many traveling is for the harder disorder that can go into the hands of low-shots.
“ Fourty-fifty centimeters of wide seats would be great for the traveling, but reality is that Airbus's business view is a proposal for a serious model 777," said the officer on the officer Mary Kirby, the officer and editor of the Portal Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't add a sister, but they offer aeroplane folder for additives to choose.
The aircraft solds even with themselves to meet the ground to check the competition coordination.
While I agree, all producers also offered aeroplanes with high sustainable coordination for the low-conditional society and regional travellers.
Airbus offers a model A350 with 10 seats in order, but he says he's not sold it yet.
The Daily Airbus showed the need of greater cabin reforms so that he offered some of his larger airports in the streets.
Officers say that without supporting the only other major modern aircraft manufacturer is not listed to new industrial standards, but it can be rejected from the field of sale of 777X.
The number of loaded HIV virus passed in Prae
In the Republic of the Czech Republic, the number of employed each year grows.
For example, in 2002 the tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later were 121 and 180 years later in 2010.
Loni was attached to 212, and it was a record number.
"It is that the total number of new diagnosed cases will be over 200 years old, and it is not any doubt for me," the expert on the AIDS Miroslav Holiday problem, which has led the Prash house for patients in the year.
According to him, a line from January to September was in 165 patients with HIV, 176 years for the same period.
From the beginning of monitoring to the end of September, HIV confirmed 1710 men and 353 women, as well as the most infected in Praia.
The number of their numbers in September received 1005.
In the Central country there was more than 206 infected.
Diagnóz also heard 1556 people from the Southern country, 130 from the Moravskosleesi or 116 of the East.
At least those who come from the High High, were 19.
Totally 88% of the patients were infected in sex.
Fourteen persons in the past have been shown in blood transfusion.
However, since the start of testing, it was not found in the CRR for more than fourth century.
He also born six children with HIV virus, moved to them from his mother.
The thoughts in the Gravitation film are, but it's beautiful, hard experts.
Fantastic film from the universe Gravitation a little time after the premier was produced in the chinese.
At the age, he saw him according to the Union film distributors at least 150 thousand divases and made over 26 million corners.
Most recense values are positively.
However, others have certain inequality.
The server Lidovky.ch asked the experts of astronomics and astrophysis about how he liked them and whether they realized some senses that occurred in the film.
Jirze Duschek (directory of Star and Planet Brno): I like science-fanstatic films I think of modern, dreams.
The film Gravitation doesn't take, even if it is a "physically real" presentation.
It's not, but it doesn't mean it would be bad.
I used him a lot.
You can take care of Sandry Bullock's hairs that sometimes doesn't know in the state of disagreement.
Hubb's cosmical distance and the International Cosmic Stations are moved after explicitly different migration routes, so they can't be seen in one choice.
Some of the movie divisions calculate the negative effects of the use of fire in a state of disagreement.
The Scaphands would also not keep such shots.
Hrdins in the Gravitation film are often gained in collision with various subjects and clothes without greater difficulties.
The crisis wasn't stripped nor a story box.
Thus, the tragedy on the victims of the earth is in accordance with some discussions that discuss.
Moreover, it's amazing why the doctor was sent to the universe to edit the technology.
People are talking about "in real" behavior.
It's like it was defined for bungee jumping.
Marcel Greun (directory of the Star and the planetary hl. m. Prahy): I just saw him on a large floor, but I just can say, I was assaulted.
I'm glad it's not a documentary film, but science-fiction.
And in this history there is the author of the right (with the obligation) to not keep realistic.
"Before you are mixed inequality, I had three times shown the space stations with degrading range techniques (the last Chinese)."
"The Chinese last will be until the end of the decade and it'll look better than it's in a movie."
Vladimir Karas (Astronomical Academy Science): In computer generated scenes, automobiles are very successfully trying to prevent physical laws, and therefore naturally orientated a disease of evaluation that in various space colonies and smokes, it is just a moment of hibernation, as well as regards the field of the world is very realistic increasing in the field of the airport and the political fields.
Inequality will be found in the more detailed study.
For example, when I read the comments, I discovered that the prefered direction of the movement of the various cosmic smoking on the victim travel is turned into some scenes before it should be actually (of the east to east).
Jiri Stephan (Astronomical Academy Academy Science): Some things the creatives have applied to their needs, but no fundamental and natural crime against logic or natural laws I have not registered in the film and in comparison with other films of similar purposes, it is to see that the creatives have made their interest in the reality of the events shown.
From the moments that do not mean is to be called the fact that Hubble's universe length is located in other cases than ISS.
The result is a significant differences on the same speed and saving operation, so it could not be done in fact as it was shown in the movie.
Then, at the time of Cowalski (Clooney) and Stoney (Bullock), I didn't realize that the ISS would round, so there is no clear origin of the powers in Cowalski, which allows both actors to be left in the moment when they are not moved.
A new vaccine against nikotin may refuse the happiness of supply
The scientists have developed vaccin against nikotin, which can reject the happiness of cigarettes.
The only dose of vaccin was made to protect the mouse before nikotin’s responsibility.
Before people's tests, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the health faculty Weill Cornell in New York says that the first signs are good.
“We hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help millions of pigs who have tried to stop and exceed all the methods available on the market today, but they have discovered that their compliance with Nikotin is so strong to overcome all the current access,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inevitable virus that has been established to note genetic information for the creation of antinicotine drugs.
Virus selectively infects jater cells, which will then begin to create the plot smoke of these drugs.
Protilates follow all nikotin molecules in blood cleaning and neutralizing them before they get into the brain, so that the cocktail can get a nikotin rate.
In the tests of vaccined mouse, added to nikotin, they continued in their regular activities.
But the mouses that were not vaccinosed said, “be silent, ” the researchers said, that is the sign of nikotin came to them into their brain.
Experiences are described in the magazine Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tabac vaccines failed because they contained anti-tracks.
Injections had to be given so often to maintain the suffice of the anti-dose, so they were shown as a dream and non-practic.
The new vaccins should be more low, because the jater cells are changed to the industry to the production of antidoxygen.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccines for people are very safe, they could be given to the children before they have a poor cygaret, and it would be so worthy of nikotin.
Yet, most likely, they would use her officers to stop.
“They will know that when they start to smoke again, they will not have any use of nikotin vaccine for that, and it will help them to save this crime," said.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but they notice that they need another research.
Tripodi believes that Obeid would affect her.
The Laborist Ministry of New South Wales (Austria) will be investigated by the State Committee for Corruption.
The Ministry of New South Wales Joe Tripodi declared that he would amend the political policy to the request of his political counsel Eddie Obeida, which had hidden interests in three possibilities on the government controlled land.
The Independent Committee against Corruption (ICAC) in the fifth fifth has expanded his advice to whether Mr Obeid had been bound in several state ministers to be given to him to Circular Quay, where Obeido had owned two restaurants and chairn, without that he had to participate in the election management in August 2005.
The Committee now investigates that Mr. Tripodi knew about the lost interests of Mr. Obeida on these difficulties, and that is based on the evidence provided in the fourth century of the ex-governmental office of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpoleo.
During the periods of discussions in 2005, the Government pressed to travel in public challenges.
The officers were against this, and they also wanted longer contracting conditions.
In 2009, the company in Circular Quay, which were offered to Obeid $2.5 million each year, was renewed without the need to participate in the public cohesion.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Ministry of Appeals from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a member of the public concurrents.
But he said that the changes were made to Mr Obeida, which, as Mr. Tripodi recognized, had been able to reach the government's privilege policy.
The provision of the talks provided in the ICAC showed the conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunnn, leader of the officer, who came to the reservation of the staff after he worked under Mr Obeid in the section for fishing.
“It was the subject of the discussions during these phone talks on the development of trade policies?", Mr. Tripodi's assistance Commissioner Anthony Whealy.
"No," Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what we've spoken, but it's not right.
It's not between me and Mr. Obed.
The Israeli military aircraft in Siria, said the responsible operator
The Israeli military airports were held on the fourth night in Syrn Lazikia, confirmed the responsible officer of Fox News Station.
This responsible factor didn't specifically tell what the goal was done, but he said he was at least one.
The print agent Associated Press shows that the targets were the rackets of SA-125 of Russian products.
At least two times before the year, Israel made an aircraft attack on the additives in Siria.
Many things have gone, and it's different.
The commentary of Pečina had been spoken so that it had been agreed with where the President Steach had decreased the unimportation.
Heaven Chovanec was surprised to me immediately as they chose him to the President and confirmed it.
The President of the Saturday was always, and it's the symbol of that CSSD-bad and further.
The other masters brought their slides in the main.
The Senator of Service is basic and readable and inutilisable, the Chairman of Zaoralek has disabilized the best conversation in the TV.
On the basis of this, I can't see the best opportunity than that the CSSD would propose for the officer of the officer of the Senate of Gaydsch, the only one would have a initial event and I think it would take a standard execution.
That's a good solution that somebody will support him from the guidance.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what happened, and continue without breaking the sides.
Alena Gaydski could not be afraid to establish a minor government with only blessing from the President of Babylon and without humans, but with the Ministry of Health of Hovor, which is actually a faithful social democracy.
This minimum Government should be a great stability because it would have adopted a correct law on reference, and so it would be committed to support the President of the Court of the Cooperation.
The presidency of Babias would endure the progress of the gift, because he's a bunch, and he will see that it's not without her.
People wouldn't take problems because Hovorka is the neighbor of the best they have, and in government they wouldn't be different.
It also pays for ANO, and there would be a price minister, but if they do not want to enter into the risk government participation, but they would also have a support, well.
Let's get the rebellion of Alena Gayds!
Foreign workers with water rights may support the ‘autority’ test
As the Government considers the policy extension, it considers the ‘autority’ test for foreign workers with visa privileges 457.
The test shall be applied by the criteria to refuse to use programme 457 to fulfil non-qualified work positions or as back return for family movement and friends to Australia.

“The declaration of the ‘fronts’ and ‘the first work for Australia’ is very inadequate for the time when the swaps required the protection of the protection of the work market,” she said today for Australia-Indian institution.
Historically it was meaning that the white work force should be protected – and I would not be aware of if someone in this region marked the statement of this historical artefact.
The discussion article shall take 12 measures that had considered the ex-minister of Chris Bowen's advice.
Mr Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday on Sri Lance, where she works with the officers because of the shipment of people, has implemented five of the recommended changes and others remained to the consideration.
If the criteria “autority” are accepted, the requests of wine may be detailed if "the name is authorised for the situation when it is candidate in relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the competitive company".
After previous experiences with companies who were endeavored to monitor the small number of employees, but then they were employed by hundreds, they may also require the number of holders of 457.
A 35-year-old man from Sri Lanky, who was struck about the asyl, died with infection after this week at the asyl ships on the Marine Island.
The nine - year - old son went to Australia together with him, and after his father died in the middle of him, a growing brother who was also on the ship.

The British Government announced a study to increase the costs of the HS2 fertilization project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 company indicates that high speed services for Scotland and North England will begin when the first phase is started in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport of the Baron Kramer said that the project was "together with the Great Britain".
The Scotland Ministry of Transport Keith Brown said that he was cooperating with the British government on this plan "increasing".
The first phase will be based on the new high-speed floor lines between London and West Midlands.
After the end of Face two, it's going to get a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the Government proposed the costs to build high speed lines between London and North England from 32.7 billion GBP to 42.6 billion GBP.
The British Government, which has made a conversation with the national transport officers of Transport Scotland, trusted the HS2 company to find further fertilization capacity and the possibility of improved travel times for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventually travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that provides better for the Great Britain and its city.”
We gave SH2 green, because the use that brings it is great.
Without this, we're cutting the crisis in the capacity of our fertilization network.
However, it is also about the connection – for example, the Great Britain will be more connected by HS2 to 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scotland Ministry Alistair Carmichael added: “Today the news is for Scotland the good news.”
For the school government Keith Brown, Mr Carmichael called to support the Scotlands in HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high speed has the possibility of bringing Scope undimensional economic costs, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in all cases of high speed, for example, British."
We therefore cooperate with the British Government to investigate the possibility of bringing to Scotland high-speed fertilization and to bring all the benefits and to complement the line of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which is the Scotland Government as so planning.
I am pleased to review the reports of this study together with the British Ministry during the next year and on the common decisions on other steps.

Rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft remaining in Australia for a period of entry
The resident Australian air companys will also need to cover their tablets and smart phones during launching and accession, and without a view to changes in the United States in order to reduce the provisions in respect of these devices.
The American Federal Air Control (FAA) has given the American company to change their procedures, so the traveling will be capable of reading electronic books, monitoring videos or playing games during critical phases if the devices remain in the "level" mode.
Those who have this already can do during the override parts of the air, but many people say that they can't have access to their electronic books during starting and access.
Australian transporters investigate this Decision, which requires a large job from the American transporters to be fulfilled by the requirements, but they notice that they are not in the plan of change their procedures.
The Agency for Civil Aviation Security Authority (CASA) also said that this notification had been examined, but indicated that the restrictions relating to the use of electronic devices in critical phases are still in Australia.
“The CASA has no specific provisions to regulate the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”, said.
This question is hidden provisions from aircraft operators required to ensure that safety will be maintained at all time and that passors act in accordance with the safety indications that are obtained from the Member States of the relief.
The Virgin community, which has already spoken to the CASA on the extension of the use of its wealth-fi system, has been changed, but has noted that the regulatory decision is implemented.
“We would be sure if the CASA Office had made an analysis of the authorisation to use the electronic device, because we really think that it would be now when we have (incredibly packed), ” he said.
The Qantas Community announced that it would continue to keep the present provisions.
"Our current policy is that the electronic devices cannot be used during air and access, and we do not mean to change it in a short time," said.
The FAA provisions are related to the American air company.
We are not yet interested in the development of the regulatory area that can be useful for our traveling, and we are sure of course studying the FAA decisions and reasons that are behind him.
In the case of air transporters from the United States, society will be deleted from the company and will be attached to their airport park.
The manufacturers need to admit that their aircraft can tolerate radio mobile phones, and also revise manufacturers, school materials, manufacturers programmes and information for traveling.
“When the airport company confirms the tolerant of its flows, it can allow the traveling to use transport and easy electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones, in any sea height, ” said the FAA.
In several cases, low visibility, the traveling orders to disappear during the device.
The group also recommended that the harder device during the airport and the meeting was safe under the sittings or in the main space above the head.
With growing branches, the central classs use the officers in Singapur
In the privacy in the purchase center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga's golden narrows, pigs and shoes to pay her daughter to school.
“ We just buyed a house with our husband and gave all my money, ” says Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although each month as a administrator reaches 2400 dollars (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family receive is inadequate, says.
The afternoon, for example, areas in South-East Asia – where the debt of the household is increased – is that the ValueMax company, where the woman conducts its transactions, has been on the sky in Singapur, the third arrested on the board.
The stop of the shoes is not just a quick way to prepare – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling – but it is almost so easy as unsecured banks.
The officers in Singapore are usually applied to the annual rate of 17 per cent, exceeding 15,4 per cent of the bank offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with pool in the same purchase centre.
However, the officers have the achievement that they don't require a statement of persons (playing history) or a proof of acceptance, and they can provide a payment faster than banks.
And thus, as families gain pressure because of the increased living costs and the growth of households and consumption debt, millions of people, for example, are turned back to the country.
Following five years, the potential growth from global financial crisis and the left-lift credits have freed money policy in advanced economys with families with lower and medium accommodation, they turn back to the officers to achieve the sustainable financial situations.
This week, the standard & Poor's Rating Agency citated a higher use of credit in households, especially because of the risk factor for the competence of the Asian bank.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapur had the highest home product in Asia.
Malaysia is on the front of the rate of 80 per cent of HDP, which is increased by 60 per cent in 2008.
Economies also feared the highly consumption rate in Thailand, which had only been reached this week.
In the fourth of the data, the continued export and comprehensive consumer demands were shown.
“The rest is that the costs of the people from the middle to the low [including ships] will try to fulfil their receive where they will be powerful,” said Song Seng Wun, an economy in the Malaysia CIMB bank.
Historically high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to human beings to stop their own own mate and use the opportunity to change for their family scars.
At least 70 per cent of the items set in 200 cities of the towns are creatures of gold.
People say, the gold price seems good, we'll stop the gold pig and get him back in the next month.
The largest manufacturer established in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded in recent months to 20 per cent the increase in the number of advocates used by his staff.
The growth in the construction industry is so great that ValueMax, the manufacturer of the campaign in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similars in Singapore, plans to expand not only to the suburb Malaysia – where there are four pools – but also Asia, says the Executive Director ValueMax Ja Lee Ching.
The Community will finance the use of 60% of 66 million SGD, which has received this week in a singapur room.
While some discretionary believers felt under the brain of criticism because of high actions, Ms. Ay says that the interests offer not only lower rates than other creditors, but it also does not exceed the debt.
“The customers stop the objectives that are already own, and the depth of the personal may not exceed the debt of households,” says.
It is still more accepted in the company as a means to ensure a short, safe financing.
In the middle of those who use the officers, they are not only people in financial pressure.
Humans from Singapore also use the ValueMax pockets when they stop gold tickets or Rolex hours, and they can get it to 60 per cent of the purchase prices in the preparation.
Our lawyers are of all the possible measures.
“Their parents are rich individuals who need a short code to pay for their reliable businesses or investment, or small businesses that need help to resolve problems in their money, ” says Mrs. Ja.
Sometimes they just need money as faster.
Safety package for $325 million for the Danish Health
The Federal Government continues to ensure that the safe package of $325 million in Tasmania contains several conditions that will ensure that the State government does not excuse financial measures.
The federal Ministry of Health of Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Sweden makes “a rapid measures” to reduce the crisis caused by the struggle population of the islands, a higher number of chronic diseases and system disasters.
Financing after four years was decided by government consultations with an independent employee messenger Andrew Wilk.
“The Government has come with a noise saving package, which, as we believe, will resolve specific problems with the state of the road," said Mrs. Plibersek today.
325 million dollars contains 31 million dollars for the operating request of the patient.
Other 2600 operations, including ortopedica operations and the seventh office operations, will help to remove the competence.
The money is also on free accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceton, better operational training, health-specific education, health services, and the personal electronic systems of health records in local hospitals.
“These investments react to the thoughts of the primary clinical doctors said to me that the best way they can help the Tamanian Health System,” said Mrs. Pliberseks.
The Ministry declared that the mandatory government should require an essential mode of exhibition and educational obligations.
The State shall maintain the current financial level to obtain the money of the Australian currency and to report monthly on where additional financial measures were based.
It shall be established by a third-term committee that will ensure that the State will add services as effective as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that 325 million dollars will not be able to follow the real reform in order to attach the maintainable basis of the public health system.
However, the Government declared its reaction on the request of a rapid assistance that he first brought up in action with the President of the Government in the beginning of May.
“I believe that the federal assistance package can increase public health from critical states,” said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional election procedures will explicitly reduce recent challenges.
The speaking federal opposition in the health area Peter Dutton believes that today’s statement is only “beauty.”
"The reason why I am here is that the labour government exceeds from our health system 430 million dollars," said ABC TV.
You can't have a State government that will take at least half billion dollars, and the Australian Health, who carries 300 million dollars, and think that it's a good report.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Pliberseck to conclude that no dollar of the safe package will be delivered to higher burrocracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted the news of Denise Diderota, which brings a special film training and the production of time, but it is also more neutral than it should be.
In the 60th century, the 18th century in France, they report a story about Suzanne, young young people who are sent to their family to the classor.
When it rises up, it is extremely crucial tolerance from the pregnancy of the mothers presented, and for others it becomes sexy.
The movie will never be attached to the illness or uncleanness, and it's his problem.
The urgent rabbit of this story brings out that the divines will also use the muck like the smoking of the smoke.
Skiareals want to lie with children

The series destroyed the essential packaging of chemical weapons and munitions with food floor, said in the quarter of the Committee for global monitoring of chemical weapons, while there were no longer conflicts on the north of the country, and it was not only one of the places where the foods were based on the provisions.

The end of this initial fase of destruction is a significant billion in the ambitional time resolution, which is able to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus to half 2014.
The destruction of the rescue means that Syria will not be able to build new chemical weapons.
However, Damashek must still begin to destroy existing weapons and resources.
It is considered that this country has almost 1 000 tons of chemical substances and weapons including Hyperite and nervous sarin.
The announcement came on the second time in the quarter of the battle in Safira, whose experts were talking as a company in the production of chemical weapons and weapons, the Syrian observer for human rights with the sister in the United Kingdom.
The group of activityists, which monitored the total number of victims through the network of activity in Siria, announced that 120 296 people were dead.
It must be 61 067 civilists, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, 29.954 members of the army forces of Bashara Asada, 18.678 rural fighters and 187 soldiers from the Libanon Hizballah.
In the midst of the killers, 2202 government transporters and approximately 5 375 opposition fighters, many of which are strangers.
On 25 July, the United Nations organization declared that since March 2011, 100 000 people died in conflict.
This number has not been updated since that time.
The conflict used about 2 million citizens to leave the land.
Asado's units were fighting in Safire against the rebels, from which many are associated with Al-Kaido, all weeks.
The observer in the fourth century said that the loss were on both sides, but she had no specific numbers.
Wars are dangerous, whose inspectors for chemical weapons who are in their mission when they are in the middle of the citizen war of Syrian to save the chemical arsenal, have to coordinate with sustainable terms.
In the declaration of the OPCW Agency, which nearly cooperate with the United Nations, his team is now “he's happy to verify – and he followed the destruction of the Syrian Declared Declared Declared Declaration for the Production and Migration/Implementation”.
It added that “no further control activities are planned in the present time”.
This week ago, the inspectors said that they finished the first round of checking work when they visited 21 of 23 places declared Damascus.
Inspectors said that because I fear security couldn't visit two places.
On the fourth of the OPCW Agency stated that these two places were "lived and ... the items of the chemical weapons contained were moved to two other declared places that were checked."
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safire was one of the places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
The series agreed with the plan of complete destruction of its chemical weapons that should be approved by the next month by the Executive Committee of the OPCW Authority.

He said that the cause of the explosion was not known.
The wrath of the cause of the bomb attacker on Bali
Living and resident 202 persons who were killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 reacted immediately on the jurisdiction issued on the last of the innovators who were established before justice, and said that Murar Patek should be prepared.
Patch, which at least 10 years had been carried out as one of the most spectacular persons in South-East Asia, was judged yesterday to 20 years of prison because he established an emergency equipment used for bomb attack.
For 15 years, it may be forbidden.
This 45-year-old man was considered innocently murdered on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which remained 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many were destroyed.
It was also considered guilty in several other points of excuses relating to the terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks in Indonesia at the Wednesday evening of 2000.
She requested a living advantage, although she could continue to keep a man with the "Demolition man" (bourch) reviewed by his expert on the production of the exhaustion.
This Decision renewed the painful reminders of June Corteen, the mothers of Perthu, who, when the Pateca launched and others, lost his 39-year-old Jane and Jenny.
She said that Pate should be judged to die.
I really think he should go to those others.
For the AAP agent, Mrs. Corteen said, "I should be set before the chat."
I have to live every day with that I can't see another night and my daughter.
The Club Sari was compared with the countries when on 12 October 2002, the powerful item was broken on 23 hours in the outside of parking additives.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds ago the self-assistant attorney broke the bathoh full of explosions.
In the consequence of the explosion, he fell in a month to the coma, and while he was maintained in life, three times the doctors were “dead. ”
Mr Hughes said that Pateka should have the same age as three other terrorist cells of Djama islamic islamic responsible for masker – Amrozih, Muchlass and Ima Samudr – which were trained for four years ago.
This guy should take death crime as nobody.
Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, just not.
20 years for 202 people killed and killed hundreds of others, it's not so much.
Patte stood before the court as the last of the attorneys in Bali.
The arrest was at least ten years, but finally, in January 2011, in Pakistan City Abbottabad, where the American forces were killed by the former Leader Al-Kaidy Usam Bin Ládina.
During the Court of the FBI in his witness, the reports of informal services denied that Pakistan was in Pakistan to meet Bin Ladyin in trying to renew the connection between the terrorist groups with South Asia and Al-Káido.
"He has not been able to be well," said Mrs. Corteen.
He didn't feel disappointed for how much he did to others.
Verdikt is coming before the 10th anniversary attack that will be later this year and to which they will be a ceremony on Balli and in Australia.
“This year we will see a lot of slight," said Mrs. Corteen.
The pattern can still call the jurisdiction.
FAA: Aeroplanes can now use technological equipment (but they can't call from their mobile phones)
Aeroplanes will be able to use their electronic equipment to use “of doors to gate” – except calling from their mobile phones – to read, play her, monitoring films and listing music on the basis of unexpected new rules that have carried the Federal Aeroport (FAA).
But they don't expect the changes immediately.
How fast the changes will be carried out according to the individual air companys, the FAA Officer Michael Huert said to the print conference.
The aeroplane companys shall be intended to add the FAA as much as their aircrafts respond to new rules and that they have updated school products for the packaging and the directive for the saving of devices in order to be in accordance with new rules.
The FAA stated that some aircraft companies have already received plans to expand the use of transported electronic devices in the aircraft.
In the middle of the companys already have been planned, Delta and JetBlue are.
“In accordance with this plan, we can improve the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly," said the FAA in its statement.
Today, from the journeys, it is required to exclude their smart phones, tablets and other devices while the airport is closed.
They can't be able to enable them until the aircraft gets the height of 3 kilometers and the Captain is not allowed.
From the traveling is expected that their equipment will be cut off again when the aircraft goes to stand, and they will not stop them until the aircraft is not on the ground.
According to new rules, the aircrafts which aircrafts are directly protected by electronic disasters, allow their passengers to use their equipment during the airport, accession and eating, have introduced the FAA.
From the majority of new transport aircrafts and other aircrafts that were prepared to use Wifi at higher sea height, it is expected that these criteria are fulfilled.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Stewards, announced changes.
“When new rules will be carried out safe, and we will cooperate with the transport company, it will be successful,” she said in his statement.
We are sincerely disobeyed that we look like a “heat”.
However, surface on the Internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will also be disabled under 3 kilometres of the sea height, said the agent.
It will be notified that their smart phones, tablets and other equipment will be transferred into a aircraft mode.
So still no Words with friends, online game of scrabble, which played herec Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, brought out of the airport American Airlines company, because he refused to disable his device when the airport was parked at the door.
And more hard devices as notebooks will have to be stored for fearing that someone could hurt if they would fly after the cabin.
Mobile phones will be deleted on the ball and continue.
The use of mobile phones does not urge the FAA, but the United States Federal Committee for Telecommunication.
FAA can interrupt command in some electronic devices during the air and access.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the State Security Committee for Procurement, a representative of national security in CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered risk.
“The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can be able to create motions with navigation devices, but we also know that the FCC data can be able to discharge in air, ” said Rosenker.
The Board Advisory Committee established by the FAA Management, in order to examine this problem, the last month proposed that the Government allows the broad use of electronic devices.
In the last years, the FAA was exhausted to reduce the restrictions of their use.
Critical, as the Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic of Missouri, states that there is no legal reason for this command.
Restrictions are still more difficult because the use of such devices is increasing.
Some studies indicate that when the third traveling is forgotten, they also have the obligation to disable their device or ignore it.
The FAA began to limite the use of electronic devices in 1966 in reaction on the removing of navigation and communication equipment when the travelers began to take the FM radio, technical equipment at the time.
The new aircraft companys are more rejected on electronic systems than the previous generations, but are also constructed and approved by the FAA management to be separated against the electronic disaster.
Aeroplane companys have already offered a travelling use of Wi-Fi in travel highways.
The plans for the Wi-Fi systems are also more different from the disaster.
The majority of aeroplanes should be applied in the framework of new rules for more use of electronic devices, says Huert.
The current electronic devices are generally explored with less intensive radio sending than it was in the previous generation devices.
For example, electronic readers gives only minimum sending on the backup of the pages.
But sending is stronger when the devices download or send data.
In the middle of those who press to restrict the limits to use these path devices, Amazon.com is Amazon.
In 2011, the members of this company launched their electronic readers and made trial years, but there was no problem.
The Member States of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed comprehensive feelings on whether these equipment represent any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Affairs Association of Airports said that it is convinced that the removing of these devices is real, and that is, even if the risk is minimum.
Other Member States declared that there are only courageous reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause the discharge of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA pilots allow the passengers to disable the devices during the aircraft in accordance with low-visibility devices.
The Road Industries Group announced these changes and followed it on a understanding procedure for the traveling publication that technologies use in a long-term way.
“We are happy that the FAA has recognized that the favorite road experience is not in relation to security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the United States Travel Association.
The bird was aeroplaned from the woods in the North Sea and revoked back to the natural
The bird was prepared to the border after that it was found on the round board in the Black Sea, and was released back to the free nature.
One baptized was transferred to Aberdeen after she had observed the SSCCA company in the safe centre until he was healed.
The Executive Centre Colin Seddon said: “This was probably baptized from North Europe when he had built a strong wind over the north sea."
All of him got powers, and he found him on the road board.
Mr. Seddon added: "It was not able to repeat again, so they contacted us with the requests of help."
In the time he was baptized, he was in a good conceit and a dream.
Is the European elite prepared for the trade with the United Kingdom?
The Business for Britannica campaign was launched in April with the promise of connecting businesses and determined what changes in relation to the EU are wanted to see British businessers and company that create workplaces.
For this purpose, we have established the largest and complexest research in which the previous British businessmans have asked their opinions about the United Kingdom, the trade and the EU.
YouGov was asked for 1 000 leaders of the representatives of the British businesses of the most different sizes and of various sectors and regions.
The results of the investigation will be for many surprises.
We discovered that most of the employees are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries modernizing and growing while EU States stay.
They want to see how the Government provides new commercial resources with countries such as China, India and Brazil, as to enter into a long and urgent process of reforming secret European institutions.
When we asked their opinions on specific political areas, from monopolis regulations after the manufacturers law, most of the competents stated that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The general concern with a single market and businessmen said that the costs of Brussels regulations are now exceeding the costs of that, to be part of the European trade area, the agreement has been expressed even 40 percent of large enterprises, so traditionally the most prosecutive company.
And finally, our investigation of leaderships has disappeared the greatest knowledge, and the unique majority wants to ensure that the United Kingdom changes the Treaty and EU relationships should be based on trade, not political.
Since the companies of various sizes and main business groups were identifyed, the business sector claims to “intelligence change” that will affect the reactions to the British.

The priority must be workplaces and growth in the United Kingdom, and as the results of our investigation shows, it means renewable purposes on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels' regulatory access.

The King Commission learned that two employees of the Christian meeting of young men were accused before claims against Jonathan Lord (YMCA)
The King Commission for sexual use of children was discovered that before the accusation against the child's Lord Jonathan's Lord from Caringba in 2011, two Christian employees of young men (YMCA) in New South Wales were claimed of sexual use of children.
However, before the Commission, it was noted that in its executive statement for the Commission, this agreement stated that in their organizations they never resolved the case of the child's sexual disagreement.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was considered when one of the YMCA employees was accused of the transgressions relating to children's pornography, and the other when the caringba officer in Caringba was condemned in 1991 for sexual disagreement of children who had in his feet.
Mr. Hare said Gaili Furness, the Commission's advisor that he knew the first case, but not the second.
He allowed the Executive Declaration of the YMCA Representative was also unreasonable when the YMCA organization stated that external audits were approved by this organization as a former resident of children's rights.
The evidence of the Commission provided is that the YMCA organization was notified that in the audit of the Ministry and the company from August this year, the second less than four possible assessments were received.
Mr Hare, who started working with the YMCA meeting when he was 21, recognized that the guidance from his own direction was able to be able to be accepted by Mr. Lord, and would not be sure if it is a person of knowledge's responsibility to declare the prohibition of the safety rules of the child.
For this year, Lord was judged for a sexual disaster of 12 boys who allowed him for two years when he worked in the YMCA meeting.
He was arrested at least six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to say that the YMCA committee had a cultural problem that personally denied to report the defense of the children's safety of Mr. Lord.
The members of the personnel gave evidence that they were witnesses of such disobediences, including the Lord was with the children of self, particularly watched them, left them sitting at the clinical room, said to them that he liked them, and he left them to play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was undertaken by the Lord and asked for the growth of security of children, because she had been concerned about his behavior, proved that Jacqui Barnat, leadering for children in the YMCA meeting in Caringba, was “the Lord’s leader, very afraid, and often was hard to talk to him about something.”
The Director-General said that he does not receive the evidence of the personnel that they feel unreasonable if they should contact their supervised and acts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had taken their judgments, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the Council of the YMCA in New South Wales has described his opinion that the learning of the “appearance of Jonathan Lord” for the organization is expected that the person has no report, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to leave the person to sign the agreement on the conservation of luxurity shortly after the accusation, he made the general manager for children services in the YMCA Liam Whitley organization.
He said that the goal was to disappear tests, but it was “forwardly horrible” and wrong.
The expert on the sexual use of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone from the Griffit University, said that YMCA in New South Wales was not safe in 2009 to 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in the convention, checking, processing, education and personal leadership.

Scientifics have more lighted the movement of the ocasy related to the dog
The previous research showed that the joyful dogs raised up more right (with the vision of the dog), while nervous dogs have an ocasy over the left.
However, now scientists say that other dogs can prove these negative differences in the movement of the occasion and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist of the University in Trent said: “The people know that the left and right side of the brain have a variety for the offers that built positive or negative emotions."
We tried to look at the other kinds.
He added that as it is in people, and the right side of his brain is responsible for the left movement and on the other hand that these two hemispheres play a different task in emotions.
In order to get more information about how the dogs reagent on the unrespective weakness of other dogs, the researchers monitored animals that looked on films about other dogs.
They wanted to be a low frequency of these animals and analyze their behavior.
Of course it's not long before we understand why they're going on one side, and once on the other side.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We made the dogs of dogs – to be in the natural version, or in the form of strength – to save any mothers, and we also made the movement of the ocean, and to reflect it more right or left.”
When the animals saw another unexpected dog smoothed by the oxygen of the oxygen (with the look of the oxygen dog), she remained quietly.
But when she mentioned the ocasy steel over the left (against the view of the dog of the smoking oxygen), their fat frequency increased and the animals were insufficiently explored.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think he would communicate with these moves.
It's almost thinking that the dogs were learned from the experience where they have to be moved and they don't have to be careful.
He said: "If you meet the dogs and the movement of them in one direction, you are re-relatedly connected with a friendly behavior and the movement of the right winds less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that finding can help dogs, veterinarys and guests to understand the efforts of their animals.
John Bradshaw, high school school teacher on the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study that he studied whether he was left and right side for dogs important.
The last year, Lincoln's university team found that the dogs turn their head to the left when they watch the agressive dog, and the right when they look at a joyful dog.
And in another extraordinary assembly from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “I write with a writer with a dog with greater probability when he lost the ice left than the right when you were almost insected – exactly against the Italian study.”
The difference may be given according to him that the dogs in these various animal studies of movies or dogs did not mean as dogs.
He explained that she could help the study about how the dog reagent on real dogs.
“In the case of many various saviors, there are low evidence that both brain parties are used for various purposes, many details are still needed to be explained – and dogs are not excluded,” said.
But in view of how easy they are to sign their behavior, it is probably not long than we understand why they're going on one side and one on the other.

Papeš František is named in the first cardinal
The Vatican announced that Papi Františk on February 22, first called new Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position at the spirit of the Catholic Church immediately after the Papey and are those who are the priest's voting, so František sets its first group of men who will finally help to choose his prosecutor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
However, as the cardinal has 80 years old, the group cannot participate in the choices of the fathers – the group is so reduced to 120 cardinals.
In the statement of this report, Mr. Federico Lombardi, speaker of the Vatican, said that before the celebration of new cardinals, the meetings of the current cardinals known as the concistry will be held.

He said that he usually called a lot of cardinals, how much he needs to increase the number of volunteers again to 120, and so many cardinals over 80 years, how much he wants.
The next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francischek was chosen in March this year, said Valero.
In this time, a certain orientation on Europe and in particular Italy is shown.
“It will be interested in see if a new father calls cardinals from the rest of the world to renew the equation,” he said.
40% of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only the invisible number of cardinals.
It will also be taken on the first choice of cardinals since Frantischek established the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from the whole world that has made for a task to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything for himself.
“ New Francischek chose these eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that it was “except possible ” that these cardinals of the dad asks the advice.
In this situation, but we weren't before - it's a simple news.
Valero said that the priests were traditionally highered on the position of Biscuppi cardinals from large places, but Francischek is “the full surprise – so we don't know who he's called."

According to the fifteen notifications from the United States Automobile Authority General Motors, at least 19,000 of its new (2014) easy cost cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, to ensure that the shipment of manual employment is reached.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism may have the extent of the front seats of the disaster.
Following that, the seats are not in accordance with the federal standards of automobile safety for heading.
Notifications located on web sites The State Security Management of the Travel Travel (NHTSA) says that “if the car is achieved, the head career does not need to protect the right way, which increases the risk of the grief.”
The models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM Community has submitted the additive on the market in June and for this pre-American car is the most important indication of the vehicle on the market since the restructuring of the bank in 2009.
The GM community informed the manager of additives in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the reports to the owners because of the 16-day non-function of the government that had increased car rental growth in October.
For the first 10 months of this year, at almost 20 per cent of GM companies, the Silverado and Sierra sold additives for models 2014.
In October, GM was sold from his additive 42 660 Silverado models and 16 503 Sierra models.

Appearance calling Obamo's caller
I chose to both - I shared the hope for the possible change
It says that the Republican parties have been restricted by the Obama’s faithful efforts
Instructive policy cannot forgive the loss of the Web pages of the Health Health or Attachments of Unpilot Airports
The memories of Obamo's campaign from 2008 are a suspicious reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris studys a medicine in Harvard in the second year.
In those days, the book will be very hard to read.
I thought that during the dark days of my second year's day, my doctor's faculty will strengthen me and again in my hope.
The Audacity is named "The Audacity it is Win" (Trufality to Victory) and is a reminder of the President Baracka Obama campaign in 2008.
When I'm finishing patients in the night and I'm going to bed, the book returns me to the time when the policy inspired millions of people and shows you the decks.
The options have finished the trial overseer and the TV reports have needed us to think about the historical value of this time.
My partners wept glad, and my parents hid their news that they broke.
In the White House, a young team of visions was prepared for change.
During the Office in 2008, Obama was 82 per cent of support.
And I'll close the book here.
Go to the present, it's a threatened publication as to get out of dream.
It is difficult to remind them of these optimistics days – it seems to be a remote reminder, a suspicious reminder of the opportunities.
In years after I put my first choice list, it actually has been changed.
It wasn't what I've imagined.
I appreciate that Obama has obtained a number of great and different successs – from the law of the accessible challenges through the department of our army from Iraq and the end of the policy “no question, nothing” after the death of Usam Bin Ladine.
I also convinced that strange infrastructures have revealed so much to move our country to the ground: among others is an immigrant reform, public opportunity to choose health care and close the basic conclusions in Guantan.
But after many circumstances, when I violated Obamo's administration before colleagues and friends, I am, if it is explaining that they can provide, has grown into absolute limits.
I felt in a political unexpected place.
Instructions of the Republic can not explain the agreement with the audience of foreign leaders or with the airports of non-pilot airports that kill innocent children in the sea.
They can't explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, or that they follow the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot be responsible for the transport of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American residence, without a straight court nor for the limit of public contributions and expenditure during the president campaigns.
They can't justify the report that says that the white house's ability to explore the media are "injugremental... from Nixon's administrative".
And most recently they can't forgive the unability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the available websites.
I don't know if there's something like that.
I had to be surprised in 18 years that the government's power could be in relation to the political campaigns that had been before her.
The volunteer function does not obviously have a pre-progress and our public conversation will create the opposition political side and sustainable events, such as the masker in Newton.
However, all the examples that I have made above will be the result of the own administrative decision.
And that's the best of me.
I've tried to both in 2012 again, but not because I've been surprised of his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented an increasing and unlimited alternative and seemed that he could not apply his policy or position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, freed from the press of the next choice, was full of the hopes we've ever heard.
However, it is returned to 2008 – with the support of Obamy this week has been under 45 % – through this book is more difficult.
I'm sorry to remember the number of promises that were lost.
This week, I read the chapter of Obama in the primaries in Pensylvania, who suffered a dramatic threat with Clinton.
At the additional meeting during the campaign, he said to his stay that he needs to get back to the time and remain faithful to his messenger.
"I want our cocktail back," he said.
We don't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr President, and I'm just agreed with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are excluded by Nathaniel Morrise.
Clive Palmer says that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in the court of interests because of the parents' authorized programme
Mr. Clive Palmer says that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in the area of interest because of the parents' allowed programme, because his daughters can be able to steal and to take care of it.
The Banish Magnatune, which leads sports for the limit of the currency of 6 million dollars, brought this statement when he tried to meet the question, whether it is in the center of interests.
The Palmer's Unit Site can control in the senate to four voices that will take the fundamental role on the decision if they can choose data from the carbon and hard work.
But Mr Palmer stated that in the court of interest, they could only be Ministers, and added that Abbotto's daughters were in the position where they could have a personal use policy.
“ He came to the large threat of interest, if he was allowed by a placed parents, because if any of his daughter had been able, it would be a right interest in whether she had a parents' leave, ” said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the elections of the election committee after the exchange of votes, Mr Palmer published officially as a winner in the battle for the Fairfax cross in the Sunshine Coast area, thanks to 53 voices.
Mr Palmer called to research the choice results to accelerate the process.
Tony's daughter Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Would it be to decide about these options two months after closing the choice rooms?
"We have to have better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, press the details to the computer, vote immediately and have the results in half the seventh evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of the grid to mark the voting lists.
Is it that the results can be exhausted if it doesn't like someone?
In those days and in this time, it seems to be incredible for use of the smoke.
The election Commission studied the options of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with the New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political program is also related to the airport in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job “really seriously”.
The Public Office is the public service.
“We don't need any reward except that we can serve society in this critical period," said.
Do you sell your hands?
The scientists have come to the way they're struggling with your hands.
The experience was participated in 98 persons divided in three groups.
The first two had to resolve an unresolved task.
Of course they weren't both.
But the group that had launched his hands had been more optimistic than the one where her participants did not have their hands.
In the next test, the group of "s lying hands" was better than the other.
However, those who had laid their hands in other tests were worse results than those who had no humble.
The results of the "committed" were at the third level of the group, which no participants had not announced the past success.
The test results show the psychologists that the body cleans really negative feelings after success.
At the same time, the tests have to concentrate more in other tests.
If we were transferring the results to the research to the Czech, we would have been most optimist after we were returned from the WC.
After using WC, there is no hands only one per cent of the Czech and the Czech, but on the path of the city's right, it's five.
In the hygiene, the majority of people are 85 percent of people in the garden work or in the field when the hands are 85% of people.
78.7 per cent of people are motivated by the 78.7 per cent.
The recent investigation described that there is a difference in the Czech and the Words, how much it is necessary to cut off his hands on the hands of a stranger.
In this situation, the hands are 28.8% of the Czech and 40.3% of the Slovakians.
The investigation showed that both nations have hands over ten times a day.
"Which it would be at the place, I fear that it's reality of others and people are trying to do so much better," she commented the results of the investigation of Klaudie Comark.
RBS suspends two commercials with external changes
According to the two statements, the Scope King Bank (RBS), two businessmen in their division with strange division changes, which is further indicating that global investigation of control authorities relating to the sustainable markets is still more frequenter.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with competent authorities to investigate the largest financial market on the world, where they every day change 5,3 billion billion USD.
The indication of two employees would be the first RBS employees suspended in the enlargement of the investigation, which are calling to the LIBOR manufacturer scenario (Londy Interbank Meeting).
The Bank refused to comment, but she confirmed that this month has received information request from the authorities.
“Our unfortunate patent in this matter continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” she reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people who have near this event have noticed that RBS has submitted the British financial authority to the E-mail records and quick reports sent from the accounts and on the account of the old business.
This businessman, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and suggested that it was released from his current position of the European negotiation President with a foreign change in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European Chairman of Trade for Pressed money in Citi, was allowed this week, while Matt Gardiner, an old leader for trade changes in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by the Standard Chartered company.
No one of these businessmen was accused of no transgression.
Mr Usher's group to send quick reports were the bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, and people said that it was clear to this event.
This week, the UBS Bank stated that after the Switzerland Control Authority, Finma announced that he investigated the underlying machines on the market with a foreign change in several Switzerland banks, he made steps against some of his employees.
In the world at least six offices – the European Commission, Finland, Switzerland Antimonopol Office of Wek, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Middle Agency in Hong Kong – examines the statement that these bankers were fulfilled in order to comply with a variety market.
People noticed that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse were also carried out internal investigation or received a request from the competent authorities.
Banks are reading years of old reports and emails to find some crimes.
Reports on investigation were invited to trade in the area, which was one of the largest engines for the creation of gas in investment banks in the past years, but it was restricted by reducing small disabilities for speciality.
Some bankers tried to reduce the importance of the situation when they stated that with a high and high liquid market with a stranger change is essential to manipulate, but the high positions of businesses say that it is not necessary to be true.
The highly established businessman said that, in addition to the significance of the day negotiation with a foreign examination of liquidity between various trade platforms and banks that increase the use of their own internal platforms means that you can have an impact on the market at a level of lower prices.
The report came on the day when the Credit Suisse stated that this week was released from his separation to trade with a trade act, which had been lost at least 6 million USD in the end of the last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their control authorities.
“We are convinced that this businessman acted himself and that this problem was resolved,” said the Credit Suisse Community.
The number of HIV in Prae has passed a thousand
The doctors in Praia have already shown more than thousands of people with HIV virus.

They recognize how many people live here, how many nations, who are faith, how large and competent families are, in which age they die, as riches, as important for them were their titles and profess.
In what way they express their society positions, they have an instruction.
And from the tombs, he will find out how their dead will stay.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's law on health care
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that the law on health careers signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the mouth, which is a fundamental victory for the Obamo's administration.
By voting to 5:4, the Court decided that the individual law on the protection of patients and available treatments – which urges to the citizens to buy health insurance until 2014, otherwise, they are threatened to pay payment – does not support the basis of the Government’s tribute authority.
The President of the Court John Roberts stayed on the side of four liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in prison.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the law on 2700 pages and further decided that the law requirement for health care, which provides States to expand the possibility of achievement of the disease, in the case of the case, would be a threat to leave any health financing from the federal resources, not a donation and in relationship with the responsibility.
The requirement for the locking of this law was provided by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Companies.
During the premises in 2012, the Law denied each of the main Republic candidates, including the proposed candidate of Mitta Romney.
For the word "Mugabe is a cold oil" is no longer in prison, the court has interrupted the law
While Zimbabwe had still had to give a good attention to how they were talking to the public about the ninety-year-year-old Mugabe, which the country will rule from the beginning of the 80s, from the end of 1987, then stays in her home.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, the challenge of the President's Agency was threatened by the experiencing of $100 to a year of freedom.
"State leaders should not be arrogantly committed to people who comment the President in the fields or in other public places," they published the Governor of the Court.
Nine judges agreed with a single agreement that the law undertake the freedom of explanation.
It is likely that the Government will be rejected against the Court of Justice, the British BBC has informed.
In contrast of the law, a number of Zimbabwans, among them Tendai Danga, whose police had been arrested two years ago by the president's chair with a police in bar.
In May, he ended in the prison of the opposition activist of Mugabe's publication of the "cult asle".
In August later, the procurator convinced a sixty-year-old man because of his purpose to use a plot with Robert Mugabe's face as a toalet Paper.
The Court also proclaimed for a contrast law that limits the freedom of media.
"The state can't contain people whose declaration will be shown as unfaithful," said the minister of Justice Luke Malal.
As soon as Zimbabwe's law was allowed, a person who publishs living information was sent to twenty years of prison.
"The existence of the law that allows to criminalize someone for an unrighteous statement has an exciting effect on the law to be freely expressed," added Malala.
Unless Mugabe governs the land with more than 33 years, Zimbabwe was adopted in March on the basis of a new reference with larger citizen freedoms.
The detailed crowds from the dictionary of one country came in 2009 when the agreement between Mugabem and the opposition was brought to the Premier Cress of Morgan Tsvangiraje.
However, the earth is still threatened by economic crisis and until 2008, the highest inflation in the world that has over 1000,000 per cent.
Therefore, the Government has completed the national change in 2009.
Today in Zimbabwe only pays the changes of other States.
The Economic Prosecution is on the increasing agricultural reform of Mugabe.
In 2000, he spread the ground of the white farmers between his relationships and military veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with farm.
Central banks keep their wave lines up
The temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fedem, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will be a constant tool that allows banks to access global changes when they need.
The banks have made it in their common declaration.
"It's a very smart step," commented the decision Julian Callow, the main international economy of the London Bank Barclays.
"Therefore all the transitional tools of this type have been permanent, so that it is not according to my surprise," adds Benda Wars, the main economy BH Securities.
Central bankers strengthen the road that started to reach in 2007 when the international credit market was first disappeared.
The Central Bank Agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other changes to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes in time when the American Fed is prepared for the end of its American support programme, which could be able to exceed the price of money on the global market yet higher.
The Swap Treaty shall be used normally to convince the non-liquidity of one change in the current rest of liquidity of the other measures.
You can understand him as a element of one mine and the spreading of the other mina.
The ECB starts the third trial to return trust in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed to bank surveillance, the ECB will look at 150 banks.
Like Tipsport (no), no personal data.
Before a year ago, I've been on the Tipsport.cz pages.
But I didn't finish here afterwards, because somebody was just sitting on the river, who didn't have to finish the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another board, the registration has fallen, then I moved, and I changed the address and the number of the citizen test.
When I wanted to finish the record later, it was told me that it wasn't because I have another OP number, address, and that I just want to complete it, and I'm going to ask for the deleting of the data and to carry up a new record.
I did so, and 24.10.2013, I wrote on the technical support that I request to remove all my personal data from the database according to the legal law for the protection of personal data.
That's a great day, she wrote me a technical support that I have a registration to finish on the pool.
It started Maraton e-mails on technical support, where finally 4 urgents writed that my request was removing personal data.
So the man would say that he could lead it to a new record, and there started again problems before I wrote that my user name was already contained (the understanding was not dismissed - it's not easy about personal data, but it's finally the same).
So I used another user name and I was excused that my personal data have already been stored to finish the registration on the pool (How could they have been stored something that they have deleted?), then, I contacted the technical support again.
At my question how it might have replied me that the personal data actually cut off 25.10 and that I would send emails with their mistake.
I did this (early about 15 hours), and I rejected that I was registered in the same day (31.10.2013) on 13.22 and that's why it's not because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the technical support I'll contact you for a week, and I'll say that it's not yet.
And what is that if it was true (if it was not), no one could be registered with the matched name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Only in the 13.22, I was actually registered, at the same name and date of birth, but I used the thought-e-mail and phone number and the world weird, I found the page that they sent me to e-mail to complete the registration.
But how can it be, if it can't be registered in the same name and date of birth?
It is probably because Tidsport wants registration on emails and phone numbers and data just not ordered as it is.
So I've made this again technical support that they're just lying (they'll be meaningful and or not knowing what it's written) because it's not true.
I added some screens that this recording problem has already been before 31.10, so "false" registration has no effect on this easy.
I'm sorry, but because you're reregistred, we can't check your statement.
And the communication ended.
Responsibility repeats at the same time that the registration is intended to be named and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration has not been completed by clicking on that mail link, and it doesn't actually try.
If I do, Tipsport is not only that he has not raised the data as he says, but still lies when he's turning back.
The worst is that it can be easy to prove how they lie and try to look like they're on the side of the lawyer.
During this question on my personal blog, the things have been moved a little while and from the Technical Support has arrived that the e-mail has been carried out to carry out and I will be informed (in the week of urgency and advertising and advertising on the same error).
In the metro on the Mount of music plays
Trading company hl.m. (DPP) Pray started the Hudba project in metro.

Michal Horatorek presented his new double album, capel and three songs
Textar Michal Horačk brought us to the Hall of the Colonian City Social House not only his new two-CD Czech calendar, but especially in the Middle Order of Lenka New, Franciska Security and Ondru Roumla.
After the intrus and the heritage on the passenger musicians, Michal Horačk invited all three songs to the podium, he came to the light in his hand and reminded the story of how they recently played in Colin and Divadle and all the city.
"The chicken in Colonia produced two kinds of carts, with which I came very much in the skin," remembered.
He also remembered the age of President Zeman.
"We may be able to turn the officers or the Dubravs in Brazil," he spoke about the parents of other presidents.
Sometimes after evening, the Horator, who didn't leave the ship, and if he didn't talk, was sitting at the table with a cup of wine, touched his new music cause.
The Calendar also made Joseph Manes, who gave him on the horloge, about the ice hockey, but this time he didn't understand how we're sitting on these targets and scans who's unbelievable, it's not Chuck.
So there's also one singer of the Czech calendar, but we're not going to win you here today," he ran.
Ondra Ruml, but from this board, singed for him a lot of appropriate sleep on the day, singing after night, and carried him on the cytar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played a perkuse, all three songs and then brought the head in the board of keys, violoncello, cytar and contrabas.
All three callists were singing a bit of a challenge to the heart side, which immediately discovered the view.
"I'm glad that the song took you, that I didn't beat me in the Kmoch city," answered Michal Horač.
After a reminder of Peter Hapku, I admitted the Research in the introduction of Francis Security, originally from Richard Muller, rewarded by a large aplaus, Han Heger again reminded the record of the Dad's leader of Baaro, and with the Horatic Explanation of Communist Communist Communist Order and the replacement of Baar America's hereafter Mae West.
Michael Kocaba again reminded the song of Sebastian, and then the Secretrate singed the wonderful song of Praha, condemned Jarda Freedom, a amazing family and an older Coloniac.
But it was the end, the shoes in the stage and the addiction in the form of optimistics we live in a beautiful time.
The playlist was prepared for another addiction, but the fanois hadn't been ready.
At least immediately after the concert, the whole fourth seats on the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the old CD, Michal Horacher's books and even feared from the Legal LP and with the accidental interesters.
Berdicha with the Stephant fills Rosol and Hajek
At the end of David's conference against Serbska, Iroslav was called the neighborhood captain of the Czech Teenists Jaroslav Returned the fourth Thomas Berdich, Radek Stephanek, Lukas Rosol, John Hajek.
The Czech representatives are struggling, but they're going to play the ship of support in the white garden, where the ships are on the vast ground from 15 to 17 November.
In the Final, Czech's third for the last five years.
"We know we're going up to the top, that's gonna be amazing and we have to focus on our execution."
"We'll go there with the only goal - get three points and sell it best," said the Stephane, the chief of the winning point in the loan final with Spanish.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Education for Obama, how to bombard Syria.
The American Command in Libya.
TOP GUN in Persia.
The Israelites have just introduced the way he looks like the bombing of Syria.
Without a rest of humbucks, disturbation and millions of publication sent a aircraft, you made the target and returned.
Don't let them run the official elimination of chemical weapons in Siria.
The whole action refuses to confirm, and they are no longer attached to it.
The entire reaction of the Syrian Policies is incompatible with the defense of the Occupation of the Syrian Policies.
And the worst at all attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media be broken by their suggestions that it was bombarded "Syrsky Base" or "Hizbalah's addictions".
I recently wrote that while the United States's academic resistance is left on the retorical round, Russia's joy adds the Siria's weapons.
And just the russ' racket of the lataxian racket was the latter of the Israeli airport.
A clear message.
And take care of, Israel bombed Asad's mode again, not any resurrected, although it should be according to the popular Internet teories.
The Government of the United States declared 2 members of space units, probably Delta force.
It was not yet surprised that they were mentioned during the attack of the American consulate in Bengazi.
It's known the herdish death of the two old SEALs advocats who took the CIA area in the city, according to me, the customers of the secret command of the CIA, which were created by ancient soldiers.
The SEALs had been specialized for a long time, or even in the CIA residents.
Now it's clearer.
Every information that the CIA has his official officers protected in Libya (only one of these members of the SEALs have lost after mynome), is immediately surprised.
But more surprises are information about the two of the unknown heroes.
They were part of the American Command in Tripolis, and when they received a report of attack in Bengazi, they were welcomed to the principle, and together with five private contractors, they traveled the way to the CIA area in Bengazi.
The adoption of the administration is the fact that during that attack, the command was not officially attached and entirely, and that it would just be able to do anything.
Leader of the Command, so without commands, they will probably leave these bodies.
Everything is that in the country it doesn't work unlikely but remained American commands, CIA agents and private contractors are all interesting information.
And it is because it was not officially agreed until the last time, and now it's just talking about the mission of NATO in Libya.
But it's good that the United States even if half-times try to throw terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would want more help to resolve the entire situation.
The last place of mysterious and permanent conflict, about which I want to write is the border of Iran.
It's not so long that the media has almost exceeded the Irish air forces for the storage of American drones.
Nevertheless, the Americans know how their ways are effectively protected.
Of course, if the agreement is able to discover its drum in a airspace, it is not to do anything with it.
However, if the Iranians are discovered in international space, the situation is very different.
So it happened that the Iranian air F-4 Phantom persecuted the American drone in the international space over the sea when it was possible to the first surface of the American super shoes F-22 Raptor in the history.
The Pantoma was intended to confirm his arms, and Phantom would not have registered him on the advice or just raised it, and then when he appeared once with him and called the Iran pilot to return home, he heard without repeating.
It's not amazing if Phantom is an American production, however, remembering the war in Vietnam.
Raptor can't be compared.
We want to show that Plzej still can play, he promises Rajtoral.
It's so little paradox.
While his team is the first result in the last time, the relief or the booker of Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that led him back a year later to the representative.
He's also shooting, shooting activity, after a step on him, he's been in the shooting in Teplics.
Victoria sat in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplics after winning, but finally the only point of these two parts took.
Francischek Rajtoral believes that his team in the shopping with the Jable's inadequate series of mistakes.
We want to show that we can play.
"I believe I'm going to go home," he promises František Rajtoral.
The man's on a serious challenge with the Northern, who plays a football, is hardly prepared.
Everything is directed to explore with the Jabel, the trainer prepares us well, as we always cut a lot of games from the video assembly.
"I believe that it will be a great cup on the fifth evening," loves the Chess representative fanothetics on the tribe of Doosan Arena.
The end of the last challenges didn't come as he would like to do it, but the word of the circumstances of Victoria refuses.
So it's going in a photograph, sometimes you have a good form and sometimes it's worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any case.
"I believe we win on the fifth, and it's gonna be good again," the less of the Sabadots.
The Viktorie's husband's will be raised again to support fans.
"He's playing in the fifth evening, and I'd like to invite our fans that are great."
"I believe we'll thank them to the outcome," adds the Rajtoral.
John Pett: Step back.
So I decided to make a step back, but when I think so, it's not actually about a step, but about a big steak - a steak of a few years back, and it's a reminder of my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was, having no concern and just come out of school and build the woods, exposing and doing the jobs.
Although these "obbedoms" were only theory, the parents' friends.
Prax was entirely different - to get out of school, to get the tattoo to the coffee and run out.
Play with the other kids of ball games, shoot the girl.
Then, at Helen's series and her boys will expand a ridiculous steel for the grandmother to birthdays.
And after some warnings to achieve it finally, exposure, in the range to put tree into cachle stones and tasks to do until a meeting under the lamp (or to join the company and to write the favorite version of the addressed school love).
Tomorrow, to buy the house of a egg marmelade (with the real fruits, not those who sell what is now, which contains near the egg or not leaving), and to drink it with the tea of the smooth beasts that we liked to my mother.
I also remember the cupcakes when the sepulchre was quiet in the room when the sister was playing songs from the radio at the chats that were soundly touched in the old box after mom.
And then we moved the cakes, and we've always gone around a single song, our loved song, and they've got a siphon.
Or we've been phoned through the table by the balls that were connected to themselves - and when we're already in the phone to hear better, it was necessary to clean up the ear, then the ear was a cycle + vata.
It was more than three times less than now, and my parents made her life so that we had nothing wrong.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPady ba even mobile, notebooks or label clothing.
The obstacle was inherited from generation to generation and the best "man" to the shadow was bacticed a trick of home products through SAVA.
From the electronic, we've got enough to be happy to your mother's boxer and maxically so Walkman, about whom we were talking to the sister and that we used in the field of school.
We've been more interesting to play with this Hop or Man's Knight, not disappointed, or how I've already carried out "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got under the video player, we probably watched him long, but he was not a long time with us.
My younger sister ran into him, so beautifully put the cassets, so she tried if she burns and smokes.
He's scared, but it's his last bedroom.
Well, and this accommodation has a day, poor, on the tail from Dad's still.
She says that when Lenka was a little, she's thrown into a video, and she thought she's playing a recipe and didn't play it, so he's not going to do it today.
I remember how we all could communicate together, talking without the mobile, computer.
The sister, together, we talked to the empty neighborhood with the neighborhood, when we meet the next year in the next year at the grandmother - and so it was, so it paid.
We've met.
You promise to someone to see you for a year?
I also remember the zombie when we fled out with the entire balls, they built snows, went on the pitched coffee at the cocktail on the dreams of the dreams.
Then we met with the whole family and talked about the summer days.
Of course, we heard the sister before every evening, the notoricly known wind, saying, "Speak your hands!"
Yeah, it's also today, but you're sure you're not in the cup to the cooking of the cytrons.
After evening, when Dad was in the garage "worked" with Jarda from the ship, we slept with her mom on the ground, we spread the feet of the cake room, opened the door and kicked on the flowers and listened to the trees that came out of the rock line.
We were near - really - we didn't calculate how many friends we have on social networks, we knew how many friends we had, those real!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write a day-day messages through different chats, SMSs.
There was nothing like that, but we knew more about us.
And so I could continue long.
It is nice to remind me, especially if I appreciate these reminders by seeing the alba where they are looking at the black rounds chosen black-white photos.
And if I don't know how many times I was, the photos are always written for a year of the image device.
I'm looking at that even though the sisters had no longer served us, and we had more rooms after the brother over two larger numbers, no one had been so normal (no IN).
And I'm more glad to come back on that step before - to the reality.
For 2013, and I'll wait for what modern time is needed for my children.
I'm sure it's that these reminders are now for a young generation that's so at least sometimes a "six years after the ocean" and I think they're very surprising that this "proceeding" time is not killing.
I'd like to do it to them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei communities are insulted because Nortel's patents
The group, whose own thousands of patents of Nortel's companies, delivered in the fourth chair for the permission of patent against mobile phone producers, including the Google company, who had overlimited in the railway framework of the Northern Company Bank.
The Rockstar Conservation, which purchased Northern Company's patents for 4,5 billion USD, was invited to the American Report Court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and other four companies to devote the patent.
Rockstar community is in the common property of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.

“In the case of a success when trying to get in the sport patents that are the subject of the sport, the Google patents have dismissed and continued to disturb, ” says the incident.
The Rockstar community encourages the increased replacement of disease from Google, because according to it, the patent from the Google page is aware of how the problem is.
Love Cyepk: Listopad Smith
She's coming from the fourth grade of Celsius, which we're still not normal.
First, she made a smile, the one who still gave her to be protected by friends' pleasure.
That's how fun, because it was a mask that she decided not to fix publicity.
He was a loyal house only in the days of her grandfather and had the night of Elinca or Adiaca.
And of course, when the sons called her.
She's very well remembering the teaching of the independency courses of business.
Now it's really hours.
That's why she wouldn't smooth her neighbor.
Then he flyed to the coat.
It's like a shirt on the mask.
Nothing, nor another month can't do this wonder to be really smoking, like when they were on the outdoor with those who are almost three years.
Egypt shall lead to the Office of the first freely chosen President
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural jury, but his triumph day is only hard to end political diseases in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursí promised “new Egypt” when he was held in the office as the first freely chosen president of this country, and that after Husai Mubarak, who was seen for 16 months before.
At its office before the Supreme Court of Justice, Mursy was also the first freely chosen islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the Monarchie from about 60 years ago.
He made a vote before 18 judges vested in black talars in a city built with regard to Nil, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We love the better morning, the new Egypt and the Second Republic, ” said Mursy at the celebration of the public TV.
“The Egyptian people have laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said Mursy, a sixty-year-year-year-year-year-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-eear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-
When Mursy arrived in a small colonel of cars after 11 hours, they built the building of hundreds of soldiers and police.
Only a few hundred supporters came before the construction court to glorify the President, and on the difference of the presidency of Mubarak's time, the transport was only shortly stopped so that the column of the draft project might normally be rushed by the city's centre in the south.
The personal prestice of Mursí, which was increasingly identified as a noncharismical “rezerous pneumatic” of the Muslim brother, was now grown from his victory and his fifteen appearance, which had to represent him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also all those who want to bring into the end the relief against the Authority of Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a citizenship, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursy clothed in a blue community clothing with the Red Court of Courts in the tree based in the tree of the foundation of the coastal, where he made a vote.
Mursy later sent to the Kahir University where he had to introduce inauguration.
While he stayed at the attention, his official welcome from the military capellis who played the national hymn.
It was the military officer of the field Marshal Husai Tantavi.
His arrival was introduced by the scanning of the “waffen and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered together in the main pre-provided University Hall.
The University in Kahir was based in 1908 as a sectoral education centre and later in 70 years became a basic islamic studies.
The Mursy established a symbolic assets on Tahrir's subject, in the place where a revolution was born, which was completed by the authorised government of Mubrák, and he promised to reach the president's authority taken by the military Council, which was exceeded from the exemption of the chairman.
But I agree with the consent of the official jurisdiction before the Court, at least before the Parliament, as it is normal, the will of the army, which indicates that the battle will continue.
Mursy's show on Tahrir's theme was full of dramatic popular gestures.
They'll have a police specialist in the ghettes, they'll have to cut off the ships.
In the ghettes in Sweden, the future would be a police specialist.
They'll take the half of their ships here.
They'd look at the order and resolve the problems.
With their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reduction of violence between people from poor places and citizens around.
In its proposal to reduce security risks with this, the internal ministry is calculated.
Following him to improve the situation in the country, it would help mainly "a fast security of society."
The document was designed by government.
According to the analysis, there was a number of years ago about 300 poor houses and fourth.
He lived in them for 80,000 people, and it's most of Rome.
The adults in the ghettes were without work, families were infected in doses, children ended in "special" schools.
Buellela lyva.
According to the experts of the problem location between a hundred.
Reviews between their citizens and others are watched.
In several places, the anti-root costs are channeled.
They were also added to extremists.
Inside, the police's fields with getty security and orders are to maintain.
The terms of employment is "the final implementation of the equal access in the exemption of law".
But it's not possible without detailed knowledge of places and people can't get it.
The specialist would go to the meetings in the gas, where he would train the half of his service, the rest would serve in his way.
In the problem location, he would look at the order.
He would also know locally, so he could resolve better problems or transactions.
"Thanks of the confidentiality, specialists will easily be able to prevent the whole arrangement of the legal action," was introduced within.
Specialistics in the ghettes would get payments, and it's 500 to 1000 corns monthly.
The execution of special policy in the problem areas shall be limited from the Norway funds.
The calculation is almost 600,000 euros (or now 15,5 million corners).
The tax pays 15 per cent of the sum, the funds of 85 per cent.
The preparations started a year, now the detailed proposal is processed.
The project will continue until 2016.
The cars were inspired at the seats.
This mechanism is successfully applied for several years to Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is not equally higher than in CRR.
"There's such Roman Affairs here," they brought the cars of the reports.
How many specialists should be in Germany, not yet clear.
The answer has to give an analysis that determines where the special police needs.
It will also assume how much money for these employees will be able to leave the police every year after the end of the project.
According to the proposal of the project, the policy elections solve the Slovakia.
In the year, this school should travel five decades of employees.
They'll be the most important candidate of them.
It should also be a special education for police students who will take place in the ghettes.
According to the authors, the situation would help mainly society lives.
It's not supposed to motivate and bring to integration.
Three categories should be based on the internal presentation.
The minimum standards should be fulfilled with exactly fixed rules as the number of persons in the room.
The average standard would be in small bytes.
The higher standards should be social apartments that would be comparable to the normal lives.
The leaders should fulfil the integration plan that would establish social workers with them.
They should keep their homeline, care for their health, sending children to school, recalculing and actively searching for work.
If they were trying to start, they would have set up the highest standard of livestock.
The procedural residence system should be functioned at least 30 years until it grows another generation "in prontographically motivated environment".
Social residence model prepares restaurants for local development and work.
They've got him to the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: The spectacular top - one of our youngest socks.
The surface is an ideal cup of 3 km southwest from Bruntal.
Along with several others, there are recent evidence of sustainable activities in the Lower Yeason (the geological views) recently.
The last explosions here were still at the beginning of the fourth.
At the view of the largest distance, there is an immense white white white white white white cutting box Mrs. Marie Help, established in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original tree wood caps.
The Hostinec who stood near the coffee wasn't holding.
The shortage after the end of the cost was exhausted from four lines of lips, about 1 km long.
The cross path to the U.S. is already the third version, the original here stayed after 1916, the second, from 2001, was only reached to 2004.
On the fifteen stages are tree plastics that prepared the local artificial officer František Nedomlel.
He used various kinds of trees from the low Jewish area.
Like the base of the horns of the outside area creates an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated for each stop.
The spectacular top is too young soaps.
Although the data from radiometer measures are stayed out of a variety, the last explosion here was almost 1,5 million years ago.
It's then younger than the Great Red (sights 3,3 million years) and older than Venusin soap (or 0.8 million years).
The shop was explosive.
There was a significant quantity of the supply plot together with the horn rings of the ground that burned by the red branch.
In the end of this phase, it's the ground of the ground of the hole - today it's the ground of the ground of the steel to 13 meters powerful.
The second erupt has made the red, red, and the places to the black tuffee.
Their layers are powerful to 50 meters, and its part is available in the wall of the lame.
In the tupes, there are ideal sopetic pumps large to 1 metres and the second egg was finished by the laughing.
In the end of the activity of the supply, the lake that creates to this day to 50 m of the powerful ground of the struggle.
The shoes in which the supply shoes are the most frequent type of soccer.
Because they are actually laid down from the top, they have received the names of the stratovulks.
The original supply supply was continuously disagreed.
However, it was worse until the horn was hard in the south side.
The most intensive threat was here in 1953 - 1962.
The tuffes were added to the beton, then he was easier and had better isolation properties.
The problem was made under the press of the experts and publicity to stop and maintain this unique place.
However, the problem is in prosperity and small consistency of the horns that rapidly blows, disappear and seek down.
It's so quick.
To be more complicated, it is dark, southoriented by its ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
It is therefore difficult, but at times it will be necessary to choose and maintain the characteristic geological profile.
Nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important locations.
On the U.S., you will get a green tourist mark from Bruntal, in case of the Sleez Koč.
Automotives can use unpair parks at the beginning of the lips, where it starts and a short-learning way.
She moved from the village to the panel.
Ivana has grown and trained the largest part of life in a active village with a garden and a base in one of the most beautiful fresh vials quarters in Origin.
However, the original owners of the house had reached her back and the rewards had to go with a small distance.
Ivana soon looked for a replacement for himself and then her old mother.
From the known ones, she received a tip of lives 3 + cc in the old panel house on the side of Praha.
"First it was a shock, but the view of the fourth mother on the round lesopark and override me on the other side," remembers Ivan on the first room.
First, I said that it would be a prosecutor for three years.
"Today, we live here more than thirty years and not only because of the accessible rebuilding, I wouldn't change," adds the master.
The mother with the daughter then went from a hundredshot-timer apartment to smaller with 62 m2 board and the tattoo of all packaging was divided.
The action was not simple, the things were based on friends, and the progressive arrangement was nearly a year.
The new apartment was in a whole good situation, but they had to carry out the requirements, such as lacking the door or window scrolling.
The previous officer built a nuclear, however, the leader of the officer was the most in practically resolved and too large presence, and, of course, a small coffee.
Two rooms assembled multifunctional space.
Architects used for the exclusion of individual areas and the membership of the chaircardton room that allowed the new light location.
The first step that he decided for a few years was to remove the case in the rest of peace.
This place has changed the accessibility of 2 + cc, but the room has received air and opened panorama view on the round green.
The next step to partial improvement of the standard was the review of the PVC for lamination.
Ivan didn't know the advice with the cockpit.
I received the magazines of residence for years and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered a interesting implementation.
So I've made the young architecture of Kamilu Douder.
"I was the most important step in the future," says Ivan.
Thanks to the transfer of the bucket was made to modify the currently available.
The architecture attached the WC space and the cups and two doors with the open rings replaced one of the smoking place.
The cup is overtime and also enough without barrier.
The quality resources represent the pizzle, in the springs are more appropriate seat, in the box of bids.
A successful cooperation with Camila Douderre continued.
In the order of how the dream dream has come quickly, but the basic variable of the resident room, in which the architect Martin Čenika also shared.
In the field that connected two small rooms, we had to get three functions, food, residence and spaces, we should not help classical principles of optical department, such as explorers or Japanese walls.
"It would be in the result the openness and unit of space," explains the architecture.
It was originally possible to separate spaces and parts of residence.
It was enough to turn back to them two cups and put between them a room of a cup on the ground.
The grounds are limited to the shadows of the bottoms and the smokes.
On the board in the coffin and the food coat used the architecture of quality marmoleum, the dressed door living by the board with the model.
The kitchen coat in the case of the need is hiding the smooth panels with the tapet.
The new board of anti-alergical marmolea has the front of the lamination of the lamination of the outcome: mixed unleaven grounds without slow and better sound isolation.
The exploitation system and views of the high color of the squadcard is an indication of how to work in the panel with space.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted to be happy.
"I love the original, the same range I had also in the previous apartment," says Ivan.
The graphic graphics with the theme of the magnolie is practical and creates an explicit estetic element.
To the temperature of the energy tone of the architecture, the white architecture chose to subtract modern function style.
In a small village, the books were able to save others and to the space under the window parapela.
Everything's on a dose, the lamps are comfortablely controlled on the end.
In the transformed interior, Ivan's great contrast with the elders, for example with the ten years old Christian luster, and with the quality artificial purposes that Ivana collects the whole life.
Last on the line, the kitchen came.
The skins were located on both sides, and the manager looked a little in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and overlied the location.
The residence in a single design is manufactured on the law, the white board is decreased in a lot of perle ground.
In a small space, the ideal solution of the skin, the shoe and the shoe.
In view of the small kitchen, he survived the full-closed storage of the wall on the worksheet.
The uniform graphic graphic with digitally exposed theme is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana chose a magnology flower that reminds her a favorite fourth of her years.
Now she looks happy here.
In the original coffee, there was a small van and a mixture, and the new manager chose a neutral district.
The big smoke is locked on the door Ronal.
The task was to create a clear simple space in which functions and devices will be harmonized.
We've made the interests materially and colored and tried about his elegant, amazing, not too full view.
"The further condition of the task was an unbarrier solution with the minimum transmission and the possibility of easy movement around the household and the performance of the needs of the day needs," adds Kamila Douderr.
The Supreme Court decided: We can smile at least.
The Supreme Court decided that the ancient Premier Peter Nevertheless, even for accidental crimes, which could be allowed to be allowed to be released before the brain of the Potter's dreams.
She protected him only the process immunity that is related to the indications in Snimona.
In the case of ancient ODS Ivan Fuksy, Mark Snajdra and Peter Tluchore, he decided that it could not be made for accidental crimes during the time of the ship in November, before the ship in November, the execution of the missionary manada, he said to the Supreme Court Peter Knötig.
The Court rejected the proposal of the State Deputy Iva Istvan, who wanted to continue in the criminal rule with the elders.
These, according to him, adopted a bank in the form of lucrative positions in the state firms for the mandate and do not make problems in the approval of the laws.
In addition, they can continue to shoot the former premier who offered them these positions.
With Vit Bart, the officer of the anti-corrupt police was also held.
The Bart's officer Oldrich Chudoba, who also acted in the case of the VV senters, did not want to explain too much, but he described: "Yeah, I'm taking the customer and in this case, but in the regard of the protection of the reality that I can't even comment."
According to the information of the Right case, the General Security Inspection (GIBS).
The server showed that Barta could buy detailed information from the police.
According to the preliminary server, the case could be related to the case of the ancient copy President Peter Lessy, which was called to Barta a lot of extent.
The last information of the Rights but show that the arrest of Vita Barty with Peter Lessy doesn't agree.
The speaker of the police president Eva Rejected the question to comment on the case of the town's defence.
"This question is not to comment on the protection of the reality rejected," she said in the fifth of the Procedure of the Civil State Agreement in Prae Stephan Zenkl.
The officer of Barto observes the matter rightly, and it does not mean that the writer or criminal management is led to the execution mode.
The Reporter Newnik has been able to steal the wife of Vita Barty Catherine's Classe's morning before their residence on the Club.
She just put the coffee in the car and went out.
She refused to say to all the events.
On Friday afterward, the Leader of Appearance of Tomio Okamura was declared to Bart's arrest.
He doesn't know what he's in the case.
"Barta was one of the many candidates of many parts on our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, there was no member of the Usvite of the Right Democracy of Tomia Okamury," added.
Welcome to Barta, who has not successfully candidated in the pre-time choices in Snemovny in the Plovenia country for the right democracy of Tomya Okamur, is known by his corruptive rate of approval of the elders of the public.
In April 2012, 18 months were injuried with 30 months.
The judgment was changed, and Bart was excused.
Slow: I want the agreement in NHL.
I've still got a happy, a wish, and a superstition.
She was always on the first place of her family, so she wants her to be fully understood in her 38 years.
It's going to get a job in the sea, and it's still longing the carrier, or the hoke ends definitively.
"I want to fulfill the role of Dad and his husband."
"More happy to it," says the hookie who still waits for the offer.
Although it's an outcome worker that never makes anything.
Although he's always showing a heart, he's able to strike it as well as the co-player.
In addition to the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus in the highest session.
"But it's the one to show all in me is still," she reports decisively.
Maybe it's waiting, and it's about New York Rangers, who didn't enter the meeting and also have two shots - Rick Nashe and Ryana Callahana's attackers.
How does it look like your coming to Rangers?
They're just speculation.
Until I have something on the paper, there's no price to take it.
I know the article went out in the New York Post journal that they should sign me, but that's all.
It wasn't already added that it really happened.
I'm sorry, I'd like to tell me I have some contract, but it's just not like that.
Didn't they call you out of the club?
Such communication in NHL is day-day.
It's going to be in the situation when the contract is really coming.
When the player is needed or it's not going to go and mancheaft doesn't sleep.
There are many different factors that must be agreed to get this contract.
But in New York, it's just like that circumstances, right?
Rick Nash was destroyed with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't go into the meeting, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I didn't get any more.
That's the fault of reality in which I have to live.
On the fifth of you go to America, are you waiting for something that could just cut down?
I have the expectation from July 5 when he opened the NHL market with free player, and still nothing.
You're going to New York to remember?
Of course not, I'm going to Tampy for children and his wife.
I'm happy to the sun and to see you again.
Do you have some planned your program?
He's given me that I'm a father and a husband, and it's all about it.
Now, I'm not a hookeist -- I don't have a covenant and I don't play a lot.
So I'm gonna fulfill the role of dads and husbands and I'm so happy for it.
We've already got two hookies in the week, that's for me and my whole family of the feast when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the challenges for a full rate?
Of course, a man can think about a lot of things.
And this can be sure.
I tried it three years ago when I left 50 shoes because of the round operation.
And it's a lot to me.
One time it will be achieved in such a phase that all the goats, winds, and games don't replace you what you have home.
Because family and children, it's the meaning of life.
Let you have the job you want.
I had a job that was the best thing I could see me outside my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of the family you want to be in America?
Because I'm hokeian, so on the first place, except the families -- there's also sport success.
NHL is the best conscience in the world.
And it's a family life from it.
My children, so I'm sorry, our children - my and my wives - were grown up in States, began to go to school and soon.
And we would like to be serious if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to do, the possibilities in America are in somewhere.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning you're staying in America?
We're going to practice it as an end.
That means we'll be in the Chess at the Deep and around the Chess Budajovic.
And in the shadow again in Tampa, or there they bring us our steps.
It's completely ideal, being still in the team.
I had great luck in my life.
It's going to say I went against him, it's still a lot of power and disappointment, and it took me a lot of things I've spoken.
But put me on the shoot, he offered a lot of possibilities, and this is one of them.
That we can choose to live with a woman.
In the world there are many people who want after this to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will in your age, to treat and wait for a gift?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.

The Internet's end of travel agents?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully separated by this trend.
The Community has updated the annual weight and expects a record cycle from the restrictions in Australia and the Great Britain.
The officer now expects that its year-based rate will be moved between 325 and 340 million USD to 305 to 315 million USD from the previous prognoses.
If the current development is maintained, it will be represented twelve to seventeen per cent of the growth of 290.4 million USD from 2011/12.
General Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre has created eight percentage rate in the first half of the year, and the second half of the year has started a high growth in particular in Australia and British traveling outside services.
“In this day, our 10 countries are driving, and some are directed to the record of an annual rate before evacuation and advancement,” said.
This is Australia and the British, which are traditionally our greatest creatures of the weight.

Greenpeace Activities held in Russia to Petrohrad
The ecological active holding from September in Russia because of the protest against the planned difficulty in Arctic was transformed from Murmans to Petrohrad.
The AFP Agency has reported about this today with a revoking to the International Economic Organization of Greenpeace.
It also says that the original accusation of its activities from piratery was not yet loaded.
"Greenpeace International, from diplomatic resources, learned that thirty men and women who were arrested in Russia after a disappointment against the race in Arctic, were transferred from a manufacturer device in Murmansca to the prison in Petrohrad," announced the organisation in the statement.
The reasons for the transfer of maintained activity are not clear; according to the DPA Agency, it was planned.
The Economic Agencies were first offended from piratety, as they were in prison to 15 years.
The past week, but it was noted that this accusation replaces a lower exemption for which a lower punishment with the top border of seven years will take freedom.
But Greenpeace, in the present statement, warned that the offences from the office pirateries were not yet reached as they promised.
That's crazy that the arrests are now accused of two criminal acts.
The powerful Committee for the investigation last week announced that the offence of piratety replaces the accusation of excuses.
However, when thirty prisoners were established before the Committee this week, the pirateries were not loaded.
Instead of this against each one, the AFP was raised up by the Greenpeace statement.
The Russians arrested the Gazprom company in the half of September three ten members of Greenpeace in 18 countries.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, which rained under the ground floor.
Since that time, they are all held in the conventions against which they have made a call, but the court rejected them all.
For the conditions of prison, the ecologists are disturbing.
The Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, pointed out today that the movement to Petrohrad is easy to meet families and consular workers.
However, there are no conclusions that the conditions in the new prison will be better in Murmansca.
"In fact, it may be worse," he warned.
For help, Willema-Alexandre requested the Netherlands King of Faza Oulahsen.
In the manual letter that he published today the letter of Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called to talk about their situation on the planned meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It says that Malachi has a large part of the renewed sectoral violence in Iraq, which is not part of the part of the fights in Siria.
Schools should be focused on mathematics, laws and graphics
At the hours of English literature, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare games, November 19th century, romantic poezy and the current British Belete since 1914.
The test will also include a “hidden text” to be moved to a deep reading;
Combined English literature and languages will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have maturity tests from language, and they will be chosen to choose English literature as a voluntary purpose.
The Ministry of School should tomorrow provide new advantages for English and Mathematics — the first subjects to the radically change.
For other fundamental objectives, the changes are expected for the next year.
In the same step of the Ofqual Office, which is regarding maturity tests, declines the changes in maturity tests structure, and it is together with the new notification system and smaller projects for students.
In his appearance in the year of Michael Gove, the Ministry of School, said that it was “the serious consensus, if we need to reform our test system to reach confidence in the company” and that it was necessary to maintain material trial to be“national, ambitional and more accurate.”
The study shows that English schools take less time of mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week – than most of other countries.
In order to compare schools in Australia, mathematics take a average of 143 hours a year and about 138 in Singapore.
However, no official requirement to take more time for mathematics, the coalition resources have not shown that the material tests of mathematics contained, together with the largest objective in the results of the results, would probably enhance schools to provide education.
The training plan will be more focused on “the problems of the real world” including financial mathematics.
Ostraw Primator Kajnar: Children in the CHSSD I am not me
Before the choices, there was a long-term sport between two challenges fighting the influence inside the islandic CSSD.
Everything was exhausted when the Primator of Ostra Peter Kajnar turned into court because of the non-democratic construction of the candidate.
However, the officers did not want to say too much that they wouldn't be able to cut off the side before the choices.
Now, the voice of the voices are numbered.
At the evening, the CSSD of the islands called the Prime Minister Ostrav to go out of the side, and it will probably also click on that to come about his function.
Peter Andar wants to fight further.
What's going on in the sports and who's on the other side, he described in the exclusive conversation for the Diary.
How do you mean the result of the choice?
The CSSD has certainly been calculated with a lot of better results.
Did she beat her before the choices solved in the media sports inside the sides?
I will imagine that social democracy could have better choice results.
But on the other hand, it's responsible for the situation in which CSSD is now.
It's a side that has their internal problems, it's inside sick and people know that it's not all right in it.
They've given it clearly.
What are the entire patients of the CSSD?
In the case of some time, the ODS goes through, and the similar things are now disturbing in social democracy.
It is that lobbysts, influence people who were expected to find their preventions in the ODS, moved to people in the CSSD and have influence on them.
It will then agree that after the officers of the officers, the police walks and collects the computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not based only from people who want good to all others, but many of them think in particular about their goodness.
The CSSD is divided on two incompatible camps and in Praece, as it is also in the current battle of power between Hashkovci and Sobotkovici.
It's already prepared for a long time.
What happened before the choices in Austria was just the preview of what happens now in Praia.
The Hashka steel had a position in order to then choose the situation that the Sobot's rod would be able to choose after choices.
Humans are in policy when sometimes need to access compromises.
But everybody has some internal border when the compromes are no longer done, and that's my case.
I originally didn't want to conspirate in the dream, but when I considered the whole thing inside the side, I agreed with Luboš Saoral that I'm trying to get to the national candidate to be as the Primator of Ostra just sent the Sobotka.
It's a hot skin, but it's got a piece.
Why are you standing on the side of God's Sobotky and not Michal Hashka?
The Honor of the Sobotka is a person who always speaks in particular about the CSSD programme and a certain peace and views for the side and this country.
I admit that I didn't hear anything like this from the other side.
Michal Hashek just fights for power.
I don't understand how the Presidency that is lower than the Central Executive Committee can just begin to call the President of the parties.
It's a lot of fight without regarding everything and the state.
According to me, what Michal Haschek now brought in Prash, he finished his political career.
As you said, the CSSD hasn't reached you to the candidate.
Political parties are based on cohesions who are as part of their members.
This contribution should be based on programme views and on the capacity of those people to fulfil these visions.
However, of course, people who don't have power or vision, but the political side is for them the cost of money that wouldn't get any more.
The problem is, when these people begin to get in the front, thanks to the disruption of the rules, they disappear the statements of the pages.
They do their practices with the political parts of the Mafia and, according to me, the laws of the Czech Republic are so disturbing.
To note this problem is more important for me than to take care of if some Yanar has a political future.
It's important that the pages start respecting the states.
Therefore, did you still have proposed the proposal to the Court on the provisional measures against the shape of the CHSSD candidate in the Marrovia?
The current period of Implementing Committee in Austria is able to ensure that the organizations which are not intended to interrupt, the new organization, intended to make a new organization, exemplars the inadequate parties.
For example, it is also necessary that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednari from the cluster's club, but he put an excuse against it, and then they were able to interrupt his excuse.
This shows that the standing of the parties through the court is the last option, but in the moment when the other ways and control authorities have stopped functioning within the CSSD, it is the only opportunity.
The leadership of the islandic CSSD in the chair with Adam Riccall is to call you from the first position.
It's a public secret that this post has the purpose of the elder Poruby Lumir Palyz.
It's right, Adam Rykla and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything because they can call me out.
They promise the people's position, they receive voices, and for those voices they appreciate their power on the side.
When I come back to the past, all that had to go around the photobal club Banik Ostrav and buy Bazaly station was only a close to them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to me.
It was incensed to me as a person who gives money where he doesn't look.
At the same time, the city was buying a mate that has strategicly a great value for him.
So how do you keep seeing this with your meeting in the primary function?
The time committee has already invited me and other people in the Sunday to assess our meetings in the CSSD.
But I think it's like that when the devil cries, 'Cause the fault!'
When we look at the results of my work for the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in the Australian Social Democracy, who would initiative and request, sometimes, even against the members of the parties, is the only development of things such as industrial areas or the extension of science-technology park.
Yet, I'm all inadequate.
I'm not reading this other than I'm ordering the others to go to the place where they're using.
Will you try to fight against these?
Because if this republic has to work well, it is necessary to work well as political parties.
I can be hard to believe that any side will be able to rule effectively when they can't rule themselves.
So I don't think I'm going from the CSSD now because I think he who makes the rack of this side isn't me, but these people who are trying to get me out.

Puts through the garden, the river and the jungle and provides the medical care of harmony
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides a serious medicine in the fields in Camerun.
Bwell and his team are almost every week of hundreds of patients
In the west African countries there are not too many medicines; only one for 5000 people.
Call here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major candidates for the price of the CNN Hrdin 2013.
In respect of the price of the CNN Hrdin year 2013, you can vote for him or for any other of the ten of the main candidates.
The expenditure has $250,000 to continue in his extraordinary work.
Without the 21 years, Georges Bwelle seeks his father, as he reaches and reaches his unconsciousness and leads to hospitals who were not delivered to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was in 1981 far away from the main city of Camera Yaounde in the car.
Before he was treated only with a smoking hand, but afterward he developed the infection that was expanded into the brain, and there she created the hematomas that made him the problems of his whole life.
“ There were no neurochirurgs in the room, ” says Georges Bwell.
We should take him outside Camerun if we had money for it.
Instead of that Bwell, he worked for years by transporting his father to the fulfilled clinicals and hospitals, where he got such treatment that was just available.
“ It's not easy, ” says Bwell.
You can leave home in five morning, fast to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die only because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwell's father died, the situation has not changed too much.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor is in Camerun for 5 000 citizens.
Only for comparison, the dimension in the United States is one doctor to 413 citizens.
And even if the doctor Cameruns could visit, many couldn't allow it.
Two of the five people in this country live under the limit of poverty and at least three fourth expenditure for health care in this country are private.
“ The only problem they have is poor, ” says Bwell.
They can't use life because of the poor.
When Bwell saw his father and a lot of his own country, he decided to do something.
Dr. Georges Bwell and his team's officers have done 700 operations last year.
He became a doctor of Chess chirurg in the centre hospital in Yaounde.
And he established an ASCOVIME non-sex organization whose members are visiting the foreign area where they provide medical treatment.

The only vehicles need to press through the river and the bathroom.
But when it comes, they will be invited as real heroes: hostin, songs and dancing and the best inhabitants that the community can offer.
In these universes, the medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide suffering and unemployed energy – is very pleased to enter the local joy.
The next day the team begins to examine hundreds of patients.
“ We have 500 patients at each exhibition, ” says Bwell.
They're coming to the town of 60 miles, and it's a piece.
During each week, the doctors provide a variety of health.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculose, sugar, parasitical diseases and highly exhausted diseases.
Others can get beauty or damaged branch or birth letter — a document that requires school, but that can not just allow many dear families.
Tonight, the team works under the local drug simply operation.
Operations are usually worked in the building of schools, at the railway or home; after the operation of the patient rises and goes to the recurrence place to leave another patient.
With the light of the generator, the operational rooms and the hygienic storage of Bwell and his welfare work in the early hours.
It's amazing, but musicians usually help the team to not lose motivation.
“ To stay up and continue in work, they play at the bubbles all night," says Bwell.
On week, the team will go back to the city, slow, but he's hungry for his work.
This group, along with camera doctors and foreign medicine students, has been carried out the last year of 700 operations, and is recognized that their assistance can be signed much for local residents.
One man said that after the operation, he could work again.
“ This is our family will change the future, ” said the man.
In addition to the organization of these weekday clinics and the work of the chirurg in the hospital Bwelle also works for private health clinics around Yaounde.
It says that this second work finances almost 60 % of its non-profit activities; the rests continue private contributions.
"I'm not sure when it's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studys medicine on the Drexel University in Philadelphia and works as a welfare for the Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization to make this campaign.
For medical and surveillance-service students, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to connect to Bwelle to his mission, it is a great practice that they would not get home.
"Dr. Bwell's, we've kept exactly the hands and removed blood branches, or we've kept him tools," says O'Malley.
It's a medical student in the second year in America, you'll never kill.
Working students are usually paying a way to Camerun themselves and often getting a gifted medical needs.
But as they go to Yaounde, stress, transport and study offers Bwell.
"It's probably a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives his life and his desire to help the people of Camerun is infinite.
For Bwell's unfortunate bullshit isn't a breakfast.
Help others to live more happy, to fulfill the promise that he gave his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this job," says Bwell.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
To disturb people, to disturb their pain, that's why I do it.

Minister Holcata renewed the Main sister's function for CRR
The main sister for the CHR should take care of health sisters whose number is over 100 thousand.
"I think it is essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized to have the healthy sisters of their manager in the framework of the Office structure - representatives who can always return in the case of the need," explained Martin Holcat, Minister of Health.
I assume that the sister's work and I think he serves the office of the office to be carried out of the ministry and from the ministry.
In the implementation of this call, there is not only high professionality but also human access and personal convincements.
"Good and all responsibilities I will try to make the steps that can improve the position of health sisters."
"We have in our health and healthy sisters, but I would like to apply also to the colleagues who don't help us with their access to patients so much to do their authorisations and help us to improve the picture of her sister in public eyes," says Alena Smith.
The new Chairman for CR Alena Smith in its opportunity to be mentioned in the function also declared that he wanted to take care of the most diverse aspects of the workshop of the sister’s health and agreed to cooperate with professional companies, professional companies, educators, other medical calls and doctors.
"I really don't want to separate the calls of doctors and sisters, but I see them besides myself, including each one has its competence and together with other health workers, creates a serious work team that provides health services to help patients."
"I'm meeting a number of problems that have been made at the call of sisters, these hate and I'm going to share their solution."
There are, for example, ensure that the review of the investigatory and health documentation is available.
"In my own experience, I know that some of the administrative activities of sisters are too courageous and drink a time that they could and should take more patients," says Alena Smith.
To the other area, where appropriate, is the improvement of work conditions, looking for the way to better cooperation in the team and with health services management, competent and workshops, as well as to maintain the law of work or unforgiving their sisters in the period and location.
Often we hear anonymous stages, but from fear of the potential position is not documented on a specific case where the rules may be required.
"Which is not an officer, there is no judge, and the function of the Chief Sister CHR could in this case serve as anonymous reserve of such anonymity and specific cases to let the competent authorities be checked," says Alena Smith.
Mgr. Alena Schmidava studied the Central Health School in the Health Sister (in 1978) and the Philosophical Faculty of Karlovy University in Prase in the Prosecution Programme of Protection - Pedagogic (resolved in 1992).
Since 2010, as a leadership of officers and other non-medicans and recognition of qualifications on the Education and Scientific Affairs.
In his professional career worked as sister in the bed on the internal division, she continued to work as a teacher at the Central Health School where she was 8 years of State Department Directors.
Since 2004 to 2009, she worked as the principal sister of the CHR.
She published a number of nice students of officers and articles in a broad magazine, renewed prevention activities in the field of vigilance.
There is no Member of the political parties.
Should not be deceived by hatred
The writer Vaclav Kahuda returned to the writer after 12 years.
After long years, when he read, living, but not written, he gives VALCLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new room of Winter, darkness, present.
The number of parties comparable to his most known part of Houstin (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahud, he spoke to another explicit Czech writer - Emil Hakl.
What's going on that you've written a romance after 12 years?
I did that, so I wouldn't be happy.
See around yourself still new and new clone of that human pottery, young organisms able to be able to be able to lying.
I don't talk about our elders, the faces broken with unfortunate desires, the deep soul, and the replacing ideals who are trying to sell their "product".
At the beginning of thousands of years, I buyed a small digital camera and got my juristian friends, surveys and hidden challenges.
I've already done it.
Sometimes I feel like my life on this planet is a brain.
I'm going to travel, and then I'm at the lamping of the books.
You're talking about a dead pound, hate.
Was there some evil in the past, who affected you, or are you just gonna shoot like us all?
The crisis has been a long time, a bird in ten years.
Then there was no name.
Well, and after that, I lived.
There's somewhere inside, but it's still a surprised silent boy.
I'm seeing another amazing cycle, every one in his torage of distress.
The book has saved me.
I participate in this exploitation, thousands of years of the movement of life system on this planet - the solution of incompatible future.
The immortal, decking complexity of life, when each stone is the right inheritance of our future.
We're players of suffering and beautiful games, when the way of try-moil brings up another and another generation of lives, which in billions interactions per second creates some super-human, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years are relatively long.
Do you know your writes as a process, or you've started from zero?
He speaks, or better speaks the dialogue that leads the right and the left half of the brain, sometimes it will spread on the famine and forms it in the book.
Like the periods of peace are protected by silent metastases of wars that may have a day - so his book is twelve years of smoking clothed in the word.
I felt that the lavine of my life grows in my brain, and if I don't do anything, it's gonna hurt me one day.
It's a file of question that formed the brain and bases it on the grounds stored in the darkness " under the famine of knowledge".
Neokortex, the seed of the brain, asking older evolutional disasters, is going to the academic aircrafts of the brain tree.
He calls to the gorgeous animals, asks the balls, looks for the answer in the air of birds, brings his face to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, the smooth law in me and the star sky over me.
Finally, my mind's going to ask the world.
Relatively, you're talking to the metaforical equa - could you get it biologic?
The brain contains in its billions of associations and electro-chemical reviews of all reminders, experiences and experiences that a person has survived.
This forest logically and emotionally designed and increased with information trees, memory records, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, has been established infinite variable attitudes, which are trying to rename and understand their environment and decode the important communication.
Sometimes, they'll be struck from overcome.
Analogically - as you would "spadlo" PC, from the language emulator and language translator, you would first enter the operating environment, for example, Windows, and after several unfortunate restarts have finished in the dark green near Biosu screen, in the basic system that leads functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the process and operational memory atd.
For those who still don't understand what the word is -- I'm talking about psychospiritical crisis.
You're sometimes disturbing about her, why just interests this type of regression regularly?
Because it's a jama.
In the context of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior, the environment will appear.
It's good to appreciate Nietzsche: "I looked for a long time when she looked at him."
It feels that a man is lost if he loss all hopes, psychically "dead" and gets a new quality.
And why do I care that personally?
I'll answer the parable.
When one fell into the throne and touched himself, fled days, months and years, he still touched and then read, and the books taught him to play - so living.
He's been a "speaking."
Maybe somebody will help me somebody writes like sometimes helped the Herbalov's texts to me.
In what way do you think of readers, a particular person who will read your text?
The one who couldn't tell anything mental, one calls it to know, another super eye, but the best characterised Arthur Rimbaud in the letter of his friend:
"I'm someone else -- this reader shares directly to the formulation of word and a lot."
From the morning youth, he read the books of the old Czech bills, flyed in the north of Captain Nema, walked after Steinandlech in the dark streets.
Finally, after all the world of the authors and their message, it says, "The suns of the light worlds of other Karla Hynka Machy."
And when is the book outside?
Does it take you to the reader's opinion?
On the back-up, who's coming to you through people who's reading the book, will you get it?
Of course, I'm concerned about people who take three hundred corners and want to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, after years, they're in the street, and thanks to me that I helped them my book in some of their hard life decisions.
The books are actually "the lives" or "the world".
They are encoding in letters, they are not experienced, the history of the regions of the language.
Every time we can get them to life when we leave their lives into the brain.
It's actually, in your way, something of God's prohibition - to develop more and more life history, small universe and time planets.
It's the fact that DNA is stored in the chair, according to the old demonological books, we are urgent of the cyrurgic.
After you're given a book - as it's -- a string of copyright readings.
I remember you ever liked reading.
You're going back again with joy, or do you feel different for years?
I'll just tell you this.
And what did I find in that?
They live in everywhere a good intelligent people.
Their basic signs - they're incidental, they don't care for themselves, they have friendships, you don't worry about them.
I give an example - in the Red Costelec City (and I hope he still lives), one red book (named according to Red), a joyful companion and a good girlfriend.
On one drink, he presented me the individual articles of the readers of my book Houstin.
I looked at them in the eyes, and then I was shown to me a broken, reading exemplary of my books.
I've just raised a dinner in the packs and wept a little bit of a man.
We all stayed there, we kitched up, and they smoked up with a lot.
Then he didn't hold the young man's robbery, and he shoot the head from the window to the dream of the dream.
It was in the field.
We went out to the night country and smoothed happy citizens, the painful souls of the countrymans and the ships of the west branches, and they smoked and smoked as a witch to the morning.
Every book is formally different than those previous.
Does it also pay for the wind text, the darkness, the presentness?
It's a statement.
It's a plane about one country for the nine-year-year-old-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt.
Ivan Bunin in his newsletter Sukotol puts into the mouth of human treatment one old Russian fear: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Buyan.
She's lying, she's lying on her.
Heavy, heavy, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were a long time in hell and lost the role of this land, we will play.
Do you need to write, or do you let it again on a free inspiration?
The answers are forever, Otokar Brézin.
The write is a wonderful way of dialogue.
A large and unnamed, similar movement of continents on the planet, influences our desires from such depths, and in such widths, that our attention is totally overwhelming - and so, with a simple self-security, we are exactly in the intention of our programmed task.
We are relied with a lot of dopamin, endorphines and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to break up, we'll die when we are protecting and getting new personal territorys.
Sometimes it's gonna be disappointed and we'll be comforted.
Only then we have the right to call people.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various struggles, standing on the ocean side of the ocean, and in the farmers made out of the skin capshes, takes the ransom of the wind.
I have to write to be a man.
Both of the health care
After the critics of the President Obama last night from his often reacted and ambitional promise that “if your health program likes you, you can leave it.”
With the revoking of hundred thousands of reports from the Republic of Providers in recent days, the President was committed by the publication of the United States.
Yesterday, Obama ran out from his original promise.
“ The majority of people who have a functioning health insurance can leave them, ” said in their statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “report in media” on explanations, Obama called Americans who received these announcements to search for new insurances on the market.
Most people will be able to have better, more complex health care programme for the same price or even more than it has been proposed.
"You will get a better gift," he said.
His administrative claims that it should not be surprised that 5 per cent of the citizens who sold ensure themselves may be taken to change the program because their ensure does not comply with the new requirements given by the law on available treatment.
“ I say this to the Americans on the round: you serve something better, ” said Sebelius in his statements before the Committee for Energy and Trade in Washington.
The Sebelius, which regards the implementation of the law on available issues, said that the execution of the Internet market has gone from October 'beauty'.
"I'm struck and disappointed as all the others," she said.
I'm trying to get your trust back.
The condemned Sebelius's world, which took the active microphone, said yesterday to the Council of the Committee on yesterday operation, which was held after the exchange of views with the Republic of Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who had been involved in whether she also had to enter the Occupation Programme.
More than three hours during the hearing of Sebelius’s repeated question, why the "architecture" Act had not been freely distributed to the Government of the sponsored insurance, and didn't buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now buys millions of Americans.
What billion will you call for next year?
Kellner, the PPF group manager, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both operations have confirmed and according to the various resources of the agent and of the scolarity are already hands in the hands.
The transaction notification should be yet arrived in November, probably before the start of the LTE network, so before 11 November.
Kellner's concurrent Karel Comark's own KKCG group.
This was under the Sazka Telecommunications marked in the LTE network's frequency.
And that's a surprise, while the poor company was not talking to telecommunication.
Just Sazku now brings a very experimental telecommunication room Robert Howard.
He started as the marketing boss of the Radio Mobile (day T-Mobile), the mission became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile, and finally led the rack pocket of the same operator.
Sazka plays a few cards at once.
She logged in August, and now she agreed that she wanted to run the virtual at Vodafon.
And it gives logic.
If it succeeds in August, it will be able to move already existing registers from the own virtual operator.
This would probably not like Vodafon's normal circumstances, but, according to the Economic News, it could be a part of a lot of more useful cooperation with both fires.
Vodafone in the present time suffers the agreement of O2 and T-Mobile competitive operators that will be completely shared by their network.
Vodafone needs partners.
And that may be Sazka.
If this success is in the LTE network (as a newspaper can treat specially defined spectrum), Vodafone will not need to leave in August, respectively does not advertise the exposure of a limited spectrum (no sufficient frequency for all).
Vodafone, so Sazka can divide on the network.
Vodafone leaves Sazk in its 2G/3G network (respective of the new LTE network built on frequency 900 MHz), which allows you to start a fast network.
The chair between this will begin to build a LTE cost network that will also use Vodafone.
They can be both companies.
Then Vodafone could lose for some of the providers of a firm internet or cabel TV.
Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovakian pool is the daughter of the Czech) immediately received a full-dependent operator with still a precious cycle and a wide offering service.
But on the other hand, it's a big moloch that will wait for restructuring.
In August, the LTE network would have received Kellner for O2 and very probablely with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already stated that the network will share.
The auction could finally end up success, but it is probably not enough with the highest parts in which the State budget is happy.
And from the next year, the advocats in Czech could choose between Vodaphone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Comark.
Or two titanians of the Czech residence against the global branches.
Do the Czech TV ever goes without signing actions?
In the field of president Zeman, the legal scene with the officer has been increasing, and it is not difficult to listen to the courage that collects evidence of persecution of the gorgeous types.
In the past translated influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Twitter, no one did this document, so to sign it under it.
True, the leaders remained editors.
However, the descriptions of the cases are not responsible for the question, since the accuracy of some newspapers are taken to the bride - whether the reaction is on the right of the assembly or that we don't use the vulgarism, the typical indication of an impropriate empathy.
And when we are already supposed to be entirely disappointed, we can't forgive the question, whether the change of the dimensions in the television is not allowed to use others, in the absence of ungrouping powerful interests that have not yet been possible.
The fact is that those who say that in public countries, such trials about the intervention of policies are not possible.
The truth is, however, that it does not mean that there would not exist the pressure of the public media.
Trusters do not suffer their independence.
They criticize mostly what they think of tendency, which is their own, which is the fruit of their subcultural.
Maybe we just haven't grown in this civilization stage, and this situation is not with us.
It may also be in the country that thinks that it's the most comprehensive in the world, the black story of evil policies and good news is more agreed than the more complicated descriptions of invisible situations in which many imperfect human habits are inadequate.
JAN JANDOUREK: Forget this country: Presidents to continue
It is almost a rule that in the key periods of the country there was no State head in such a form to fulfil its state obligations.
If T. Masaryk was physically and mentally younger than five years, the end of his president's time and events around Mnichova would be a little different.
We probably wouldn't play the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the airport could have been able to destroy the hard weapons, and the government could go to London immediately and do not work on its legitimity.
And mostly, he would have no nation of cocovin today from that capital.
Beneš was not the Stater, and for Mnichova was still in the condiction, but for the war, it was already started to go out of the cock and in the 48th.
To be a better thing, the third could go to the cycle and submit the legitimity of communists and their pugs.
I'm sorry to talk to Hach.
They chose him with that "Man President will not be in the situation that he will decide."
I just had to, even though the big decision was not in the office with Hitler's legs.
The officer of Francischek Moravec on the last days of March 1939 said what all should be done to make that the occasions he knew exactly on the day, did not go to Germans so hungry and with such disasters.
The Senial President and the ransom government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
Godwald had left the human board to reform his flying community as Moses commanded him.
The freedom humans had been definitively dismissed by the part of normalization and had to have him, full of senial, seat.
That Husaka was a ill and sick depressive age in November 89, but it's the only cost.
Havel had happy that the last years they didn't get him in the office, he was the worst.
Klaus is still witnessing tennis reviewer, but many of his causes make sure that the thoughts processes are no longer what they were.
Well, now we have this.
The head of the State and the officer of armed forces looks like it looks like and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, now isn't worse outside the republic.
Or maybe it's horrible, it's not just to see.
Then it's a question if it's not exclusively (of historical views) that the President is not fully in force.
It's normal, but it's not.
Can't we choose the President in this country again again a person who is acceptable and acceptablely healthy?
The remote planets, black films or a little fantasy on alien life on earth are not the subject that an American jazz saxofonist Wayne Shorter would overcome the lead.
In its quartet, which in the large Lucerny room of 6 November, the aeroplane of the Struny's feeding, which is all related to all.
Wayne Shorter's party quartet of jazz saxofonists are current musician feelings.
According to his task, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they're alive.
They are accessed to music as a full-comprehensive comarical matter and think of no harmony or ritm, even in film images.
This principle, however, is eighty-year-old Shorter - a stranger packaging, notebook nine Grammy, sometimes Miles Davis and the most largest jazz saxofonist - explains.
He doesn't speak too much about music, although his whole view of life with music smells.
In my eight years, I came to think that it was best to leave them to surprise.
"A lot of people plans everything and then they're crying when things are done different," says Shorter.
As the Taiwanians took the markets of Paris bar
Perhaps you're surrounding, and then you don't know that it's half kilograms of the year, you're going to eat very well.
For example, it's in the brain.
If you consume it, then you are only trends: it's environmental, useful, and you also have a unique experience.
The meat offered as the first in Paris on his food list at the beginning of October, Elie Daviron, the cuisine and the leader of the Bar Le Festival Nu.
Bar for whom the name was the inspiring book William Burroughs Nahya dinner, you would find in the 18th modem in the Montmartre's tourist a lot of visited tourists.
With a white avokate, covered by red paprics, cutting and smoking smoking in the new hosts can try not only various balls, cups or water browns, beat them and smokers.
Peacely and specially packed additives (as soon as the smoke is not cut off the feet or not covered), Davirono sends from Thailand.
Europe's first learning to eat myths, there's normal.
The manager of Paris Bar with the pioneer menu will now indicate some reasons why to consume just a mixture.
The first of them is ecológical rate, because the product of the humume is much less cost for our planet (the financial, space and water consumption) than in traditional mass.
"Moreover, it's a wheat of a wonderful white source and an ambush of 3 massile cylin," said Daviron for the Reuters station.
In addition, the young cooker will not stop his professional, just make a goal to offer his advocats a unique kulinary experience.
According to him, he makes a right restaurant of joy, feelings of sin and atmosphere.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just using a new experience," explained.
Not everybody would likely be overwhelmed as he uses the branch of the cup of the pet, but the responsibility of the Parise Bar's reaction on the guarded mixtures are very positive.
Even the skepts will finally smooth, even when they start with the smallest society, and at the end they will choose a skorpion.
The prices of these instaurants are moved from five to nine euros.
President Svazu's businessmen in the establishment in CR Vaclav Mataias: New green support should continue
The Czech Institute shall be addressed by the continuous cluster of the mandate and not to resolve the problem of investment equipment.
The publication of the New Green Support was a positive signal for our establishment, especially for small and central companies in individual regions.
It is not only a great opportunity for citizens that will take significant amounts of extraction after the implementation of measures, but also opportunities for establishing companies and manufacturers.
Each invested billion shall be brought to the State more than 2700 new workplaces.
In view of the fishing policies of the State are significant packages and multiplication effects, it is also one of the most significant growth measures.
The vote of companies in the ECR is therefore essentially not agreed with the exemption of the Government and requests the implementation of such steps that would allow further progress of the programme to be issued in its framework.
CHAPTER, 1 November 2013
Pes shocked the colberc, the president cut and finished the berlies.
President Miloš Zeman left a motolic hospital in Prase on Friday, where he traveled night on bed and went to the lake in Lanch.
In what health situation?
In an unprecedent recognition, John Kerry said that the American spionage “he came too far ”
John Kerry stated that the United States's defense position was in respect of his monitoring programmes and in an unprecedent recognition said that in some cases the Spionage “he was too far.”
The Ministry also recognized that he was responsible with Barac Obama for that, with regard to the shoes of the NSA spionary activities, which appeared by the reporter Edward Snowden, they were working as “autotopilot”.
The public information were called diplomatic forces between the Government of America and its connections.
Mr Kerry, through the video-connexion on the open government conference in London, said: "It is not sure that the President and the others in the government, we really have learned about some of the things that had been departed from the conscience, because this option was, with a range of the second world war, difficult war, and then, of course, 11 September."
It was therefore the first statuted member of the United States government, which recognised that the American spione has passed through the border, but it has not shown that there was no right to be done.
He said, “In some cases it came too far.”
And the President is determined to try to explain and explain it to people, and he now cares out the precious investigation that nobody feels that it has come to disagreement.
I assure you that in this process it is not possible to disagree the rights of innocent persons.
However, Mr. Kerry continued that the NSA organization encourages the good and that her monitoring operation has saved many lives.
He added: “We are involved with the new world in which people want to burn themselves.”
In the world there is radically extremism that is absolutely decisive to kill and cast people into the air and attack governments.
What if you could take it and stop before it happens?
In fact, we refused to disappear the aircraft, to explore the buildings and to not be prepared, because we can learn about these plans before.
The President of the Secretary-General for the European Affairs in the fourth century said that the American lawyers are income to Europe to respond to the fears of the frontiers concerned with the additional American spiones, and the European believed that they should still be attached to their forces in fight against the terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke with the members of the European Parliament and other persons and that they take care of their expenditures to stop participation in anti-terrorism organizations because they are developed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the National Security Interests of the United States, it is really important to stay with us in one ship with Europe, and this regarding common efforts in combating the terrorism, he said in talking with Washington Murphy, Democratic Party members and President of the Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs for Europe.
And I'm going to Europe to clearly show that we must continue in cooperation with terrorism, not on their relationship on the NSA programmes.
The reports in the medium that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, interrupted relations with some American connections, even though the leader of the Agency said this week that they were unexpected and refused to unconscious metadata collected and shared with the United States,
Next department citated documents under Snowden that the NSA had seen the phone of the German offices of Angely Merkel and the other to 34 world leaders.
The manager of the national reporter James Clapper's sponsor of partners had a need and said he was one of the two sides of a regular case.
In the middle of Murphy said that his office plans a parliament route that should be carried out this year, and he hopes that in the delegation the members of both sides and comor are appeared.
In the next days, the names of other lawyers are published that they are able to introduce.
He said he's still working for the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the path is to help improve relations, it adds that they will be prepared as well as “the good-minused initial measures”.
He said that the European leaders should be respected to their own people, in the case of the spione programmes which they use for years.
“Before we edit our monitoring programmes to protect the rights of the Europeans, they also need to know that we are not the only one who leads a spionage here," said Murphy.
In the middle of Mr. Kerry, the plan of this week on the Middle East and Poland, to react to immortality, has already chosen American strategy in Siria, Egypt and Iran and American monitoring activities.
Australia was called against the residence in Thailand
One-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sent to the fifteenth-day prison at Phuket Island, when she was unfaithfully stated that she was attacked by the taxi, was called against the currency and was released to the ship.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by the land court on the island Phuket of a cruel accusation when the Taiwan police said that the taxi manager with two other men who had been arrested it in the morning hours on the week 10th.
However, the record of the industry television later discovered that after what happened to his Australian friend, he returned safely to his hotel.
The police from Phuket's island took a conversation with Bamford two days before she realized that it was a matter.
Before the court process, it was held in the local police target.
Bamford was judged for 15 days of prison in a manufacturer equipment with low care for periphery in Phuket, where to be placed in prison for adult women.
He's a daughter of an older Australian ring player Peter Tunks, who, in case of his daughter, asked for help of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks said to the Sunday Telegraph letter that the whole family had a "extreme fear" about her daughter and wanted her to return to Australia.
“ Obviously, it's a serious period, but we hope that it's going to come back to us first in security, ” said Tunks.
Bamford was calling against the judgment and was released for 50 000 baths.
The reports from Australia indicate that it has been allowed to travel in the Recreation Area of Krabi on the south of Thailand.
The right source in Thailand states that Bamfordo was attached to the local lawyer in Phuket, but it had been aware that the revocation could lead to the court guide that her punishment increases and leads into prison for adults.
However, after the recent killing Australian officer Michelle Smith in Phukett, Thailand can also try to fix a surrounded image, which may be likely to be freed.
Jagr smoothed: golf from the bowl?
He's getting a puck in the box, and nobody's got it anymore.
In addition, the job changed after a quick cut.
Jaromir Jagr thus smoked against Tampa in the middle night, on Friday after evening, 119. The NHL winning hair commented on the Facebook social network.
"After looking at this video with my agent Peter Freedom called the Cheese Drah director and asked him if I had no interest to make a reklame on their most moderate street Pendolin!" he wrote to the Jagr's presence.
We're typically similar.
I think I'll have to finish the night training so I'm not faster yet.
"I'm afraid that you could then call the Ministry of Protection and want to make a reputation on the sticker!" he added the smiley.
New Jersey also wrote the second victory in a series.

Royal choices are less than the winds have brought the buying.
They are not only parts that have not been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be achieved (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and the ultimately and the CHSSD for their internal area.
The politicians have stored us in the place of the Sunday Sights for a week of allowance.
By the choice, Andrea Babish had been a shooter, who had promised to change the appropriate political style of government.
The distinction of the election results and discussions in the victory side is replaced by Mr. Milosche Zeman, without regarding the exploitation of the elections that the president Zeman publicly supported, and did not choose to the messenger's dreams.
However, the President has lost a strategic smoking before other policies, but he remains a few ways to reach it back, for example, by the election of the future premier.
While the CSSD's opportunity to get the premier cross in my eyes, the company of Andrea Babiš is close to me.
The optional development is, however, for a mile of remote and hot creation of stabil governments, but in comparison to the pre-selective scenario of the Lewiss Government of the communists supported by the Commission, is this development for enterprise in the CRR and then the economic is only better.
With regard to the vote of ANO, agreements with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most probable variation of CHSSD, ANO and KDU-CHSL (all 111 pounds).
With regard to the cluster in the CSSD, which has become unreadable and weak partners in the exhibition, the results of coalition operations may be sufficient for the CSSD.
The minimum government of the CSSD composed with the "Neighbors" on the Garde is probably not going.
Furthermore, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be disagreed by many social democracies that can lead before or later to the next group on the side.
So I ask myself, "Don't we need to be along with another previous choice?"
Other options would have already been referenced to the power of the volcage Mandate of ANO.
The CSSD plans for the implementation of sector data, more explicitly highlighting the data from the achievements or the construction of the State banks have been achieved under the table.
The CHSSD, ANO, KDU-CHSL and Application is also agreed on the support of the undertaking, a serious fishing policy (governmental deficit under 3% HDP), support of the employment of disappeared persons, reducing low DPH in the selected goods.
Third desktops are most available in view of social policy and the size of the State.
ANO is now, but now, so the program is the most probable coalyce ANO, CHSSD, KDU-CHSL would have closed the way.
All of my view is finally better than the left program with data on everything that is still in the economy.
