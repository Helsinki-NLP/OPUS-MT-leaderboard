Promoted Livingston 建立Rangers 建议Steven Gerrard 只要他的第二次 defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's streke proved the difference as Gary Holt's side moved level with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side remains without a far win in the Primership this period and face leaders hearts, who they track by 8 points, next Sunday.
到此之前,Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, mientras tanto, extend their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste defense since replaceing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston miss chances against blunt visitors
Holt's team should have been before they scored, with their direction cause Rangers all kind of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but draged his effort through the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could just direct his effort wide after sliding in to meet Craig Halckett's head over the targets.
hosts were content to let Rangers play before them, knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces.
然而是那种主要目标来的。
Rangers concedid a free-kick and Livingston worked a opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combinating to set Menga, who took a touch and scored from the center of the box.
由于那站, Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defenceless and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was greatly untrusted,
那个パターン依然进入第二半,但是Alfredo Morelos 作为救世主从 Kelly 。
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set game.
Crosses continuously came into the Livingston box and were permanently cleared, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's problem on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were waved away.
「Phenomenal」から Livingston - Analysis

个基本工程度と resultat for Livingston.
为了一个人,他们 were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
他們的 style of game and personal has scoredly changed since their return to the top flight,但大信一定要去Hall for the way he has gavanised the team since his arrival.
他有这么多英雄。
Captain Halckett was an enorme, marshaling a superbly-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll on their toies.
Rangers were short of inspiration, however.
當然是在時下 Gerrard , 他們就好短於那些 standards .
他們的 final ball was missing - 只一次 they cut the home side open - 還有它是一件事 WAKE-up call for Rangers, who found themselves in the mid-table.

"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the U.S.A." he said.
"Quando aucune confidencialité in the U.S. , 我们的国家安全 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
即使 Ri reprised familiar north Korean claims about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which北朝鮮会提供了 gradual steps, his statement appeared significantly in that it doesn't reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang in the past.
Ri 跟一位服务总统和一位北朝鮮指挥官在シンガポール 12  juni , 以Kim obligated to work to the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised warrants of North Korea's security.
北朝鮮是在寻找一端到1950-53 韓战,但美国说Pyongyanga 第一次给她核武器。
ワシントン也抵抗了 calls to relax tough international sanctions on north Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the " declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us.

但是,USA Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 提出 U.N. 保安委員會 十二日 , 說: "Forcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue effectively and without fail until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclearization."
安全 Council has unanimally built sanctions on north Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and balistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly 以后说他会再 visit Pyongyang 到下个月准备为第二个合計。

Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: メンガ目標下降 Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another level of blues as Dolly Menga's streke consigned by Steven Gerrard's displaced side to a 1-0 defeation at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to register their first win on the route since 4--1 triumph in St Johnstone since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, mais Gary Holt's team's team just the second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side 8 points address of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Menga struck 7 minutes ago half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling.
既然Rangers现在降到6位, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there could be more in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was obviously rip out from the distance end.

Holt, 另外手下, 跟同 Livi 11 , 取出点了心理事故昨周, 他就会感到好运他的好-drilled 利益 suffocated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston done more with the ball they had.
他們應該 scored just 2 minutes when Menga's first-time lay-off send Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's destination, 可中fielder tighted his great chance wide.
深深 Keaghan Jacobs Free-kick 然後找到skipper Craig Halkett ,但是他的守護 partner Alan Lithgow 唯一能站长大在背後郵件。
Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than faith about their game in the third.
Alfredo Morelos 當然感覺過,他應該有一件 penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but refer to Steven Thomson wawed off Colombian's apps.
Rangers managed just two first- half shots on targets but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was just troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a fame Ovie Ejaria streke.
当Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of game, 没人能否拒绝他们为他们的格式。
又是Rangers 交易 עם 深 Jacobs set-pipe.
Scott Arfield didn't react as Declan Gallagher closed the ball to Scott Robinson, who keeped his cool to rip Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at the break when he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided a immediate impact as the winger locked in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raceed from his line to block.
But Livingston continuously sucking the visitors in playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sueing long ball after longball.
Holt's side could have stretted their leaders in the final stages but McGregor 站立好为了拒绝Jacobs before Lithgow leaded wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he touched with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away.

Johnny English Strikes Again review - subpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spaof
