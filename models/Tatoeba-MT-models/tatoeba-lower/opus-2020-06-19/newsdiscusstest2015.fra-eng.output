UKIP residents who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that NHS does not need to pay for those who are coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with the spirit, he answers yes when the interviewer asks him specifically if people live with HIV are included in the indesiderable.
First, you use special arguments, then discredit them by a cold homophophobie.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to make the cronical hypocondrie behind them.
I think it's you who use special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right chickens, does not practically exist.
I think it's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the UKIP parallel universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A citation from a turchon is not by a evidence.
Yeah, then take the messager.
The mail has not written the report, but he just commented it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be explored by promoting such a popular propagand as if it was reality.
I don't think you know what's a special argument.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, then you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by homofobia accusations.
The phrase of Farage was very surprised, but only because we are talking so rarely about this problem.
He did no homophophobe notice absolutely.
It's gonna need you to make it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come, but I imagine you don't like when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rare because, contrary to Farage and his single disciples of Thatcher, who think that the sida and inondations are a sign of God and not a thought on their own incapacity to understand that the complexity of humanity is something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is too severe in Ireland and Spain.
With the new crisis that arrives in the outside period, there will be no arrangement.
Especially 5% of growth in 2015 is a great plastic.
Ireland's the 'TIGRE' of the EuroPE' we benefited, there are some years.
We've known the way!
This starts to read the article.
We are trying to believe that Ireland is a vermune country and that a 'Nouveau MIRACLE ECONOMIQUE' is in the way to produce it.
With Brussels' Agreement, on the lowest European society, a three-soft work market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients, it's not what's 'pool' for the time with the Polands' coming.
In the 80s of the twenty-fifty years, Ireland was one of the most poor countries of the European Union, with the Portuguese considering a constant permetrator, without new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was before.
Their development was not a long street, but the recent events.
The lowest investment of Europe?
It's wrong!
Latvia has a rate of 0% of enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France in the part of policies on multinational impositions.
If we believe a report in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only PMEs pay full poor.
Now I confirm that the road train has been greatly returned, and there are new cars (and sweet) with all the streets, exactly as before the crisis of 2008.
I lived in Dublin since 14 years, the repeating is clearly in the quotidian bowls from the rent.
Is it census to be economic currently?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will immediately fall.
In another article they are writeing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a cross-border at A140.
Does Ryanair now take the travellers from a flight to the other way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a new floor of devices, so some boats and rays on olders will be quickly forgotten.
This says I fly with him next week, so I hope it's not on one of these two once again.
So it would be totally the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay a supply to passors for additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without this type of Irish business, you can't allow you to go in vacances, young man
I never took Ryanair and the three last time I took the airport was with BA.
I prefer when the air company proposes a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to the heart of joy.
Whatever the article on Ryanair describes of the decades of people who would never take Ryanair in the place of those who love to take Ryanair and think that those who suffer other things than the base tariff are only to take it to themselves, etc.
It's too transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy for additional costs of this accident.
I'm asking what the late will be and if it's gonna need to deal with the passors and, if that's the case, if Ryanair will not pay by saying that it was a mistake of air controllers in the airport.
The travellers have been set in another airport at least one hour, they have no right to indemnize.
I'm sorry to decide you and your dreams of indemnisation.
Welcome to this British Airways fly that brings the English ISIS in Syria, not true as you say.
Good travel
Last Wednesday in Paris, the Frances-Bourgeois rue: Marais is in a large part of a pioneer, and literally the world's crew.
People don't come in mass for the quality of restaurants (which, for most), nor for the Review Hall in the Whites-Manteaux Space (hyper-intellectual and easy-bearing).
The reason of this people is that the stores are open and that the quarter is incredibly living and animated.
With many strangers who depend...
Do you think the opening of the Sunday will create works?
Go to Paris Rue of the Bourgeois Frances where the boots are opened in Denmark, bullshit of world with 50% tourists .
@aloes Faus!
The only argument that would be acceptable to me is the one of the areas that receive a major number of stranger tourists, and it is noticed by the fact that they are achieved in detail.
Tourist areas lose each year a significant volume of business number for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where cost equipment, exploits in Denmark, allows the low prices .
Dominical repose is a right that is beneficial, except except the salaries.
That is why it is proposed and regulated by the work code.
Not the Minister of Economic, nor the rest, the carried out foreign business, has no competentity to reform the work code.
So they're kidding her.
What's the law that serves?
It is to satisfy a part of the population and businesses who want to work in Denmark .
In Montreal the Sunday apm I bring my little children to the municipal library.
In my village of 30000 people where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days per week but not we!
That's access to culture...
And it is also the regulation of the work time.

What if the success of her daughter was, against her will, use to pay the successful costs?
There's some pieces.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Unfortunately his success would like his part of the ship, if you'll pass the expression to me.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of locations such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas together and add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I'm not yet.
But for five years, and only five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he held his head to other government aristes who wanted to discuss a “Agreement ” with the Nazis, and he was very happy.
With his beautiful and energy, he has one country in the idea of fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, finally, the whole world can thank God for those five years, just those five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
The Great Churchill has nothing to see with this discussion.
Their descendants sold the pieces on the free market to meet the money of success, they could even make a benefit.
If the public wants to admire one in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
That's so simple.
But we could use the money of the pockets.
There is no one that, when it was “the moment of truth, ” Churchill’s personality was a positive benefit for his country during the Second World War.
A relationship of the internal market by public works will only improve great companys, which will increase their shares by refusing to build, the infrastructure challenges are not renewable by definition.
With regard to social reforms recognised by the Ministry, they reflect the real français: the disagreement in the dialogue
Return to the main values.
A reform of the assessment is not contradict.
Let the lowest of us not be in the need!
As solidarily, we are coming to his help, or he has carried out DROIT in switching the services he did or made a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer the smic corresponding to this vision.
There is also the bathroom that sees income of its properties.
There must be a difference to those who invest for a return at the time of his retrait and who lives from its costs.
A good to praise two for a couple on the top, it's fast
The small genius of the Finance misss a single imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of carence in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are surrounded.
The need of infrastructure is marginal, therefore, a new agreement may be a solution.
In particular, at a time when the issue of decrease in response to a recession that is only a brutal decrease
You would have been right before 30 years ago: more (or possibilities) of bargains, carbon mins, authors...
But if we want to reduce the future climate-energy choc, then the need of investment is crying: isolation, renewing of the ferroviary network, town transports, transport and energy storage etc.
A fiscality that favors high revenues and rewards.
Who's in power?
I've obtained smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's benefits are made bad by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same game
Introduction in September half September by AppleTM most larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 More Maybe seduced compounds that would have buyed a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not Apple's benefit.
I think it's essential that we have a alternative.
When Microsoft placed this philosophy, we knew a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
Moreover, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I'm tendency to buy Apple, because I love their subjacent philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some persons don't appreciate any value to design, for them options, functionality and price.
There's nothing bad about it.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there a better builder, not really different, but similar.
I would like to see a industrie of the flowering portable, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's more healthy and must be encouraged.
This is our interest to everyone.
I'm happy that you've found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not a Apple product, even if I did a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our humpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight the ideas and not men (in contrast, even on Paris bobos ), could tell us what the authors they fight the ideas of the genre and indicate us the works they hear right to fight.
Or are they just attacked to the type as described in The Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Okay, Jean, I love you well, and you're someone of intelligent and cultural.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vineyard who called Holopherne, a nearby who didn't come to me (I didn't have his spirit lives).
If, in the "back", because you're going back, this matter doesn't interest me, and I really don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get me out of my arrival, because I'm late, but I understand...
@ Jean : Remember that, culturally, send Judith to Holopherne, it is.
Who's afraid to ask the World?
But what are we afraid of those who fear?
Furasato and @ gives us answer elements.
The first calling Judith of the Bible, the second qualified Judith Butler of a very symbolic branch.
We see how much these studies touch the most intime in their house.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much more deep.
@ Have you read, Jean, that the World has published a article on the need of the theology?
@: I thought he was supposed to go to the sources.
Presenting to fight ideas from the only exhibition of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theorie of Genre or X Lacroix, theology ), I don't seem very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our unpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I don't think he's understood the nudity.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic training, I felt of the "The Second Sex" (and it was more than my time) which I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's vows.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was shortly shown when the clouds were opened.
This sudden apparatus of the red moon had its charm and a little compensated the deception of having sometimes the view locked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of the last night would really send the coast of Victoria and NSW, while the largest part of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash of blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey is responsible for the Labor.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give him his real color since possible.
That obeys you, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne, then, naturally, I just saw clouds.
Melbourne has also succeeded to cover its rain throughout the week of the weather rain of Persides and practically all important astronomical phenomenones of these last years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to stop the inhabitants of Melbourne to see whatever is from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for a observer, even if things are greatly improved from the other side of the Cordillere.
There were a period of 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipse because of clouds above Melbourne's balance.
I'll put a TAXE on this eclipse.
QUICONQUE looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I think your first thought of the day is for Abbott, even as the last before you sleep.
Who or what will obey you when he will end (forever) by disappearing?
It seems that you had a lot of time to read the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Government of Abbott to accuse them to be obeyed by the EUX.
Super picture of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
It seems that Mars's going to get in coalition with the Earth!
Nothing on the wood and immobilier specification.
Nothing about the illegality between the income of the work and the capital.
Nothing on the fiscal fraud.
The other liberalism is trying to kill Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article said too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these preconditions are not given.
No hypertext link to original documents to make a opinion.
Today, March 15 October, see the results of the wonderful recettes: in Spain, exports are lowly five years.
Greece, the bullshit flows.
However, this appears to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notebooks would generate an indemnisation request for 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy indicates that these indemnization requests are not based.
What if the Economic Ministry is wrong?
Will the decisions who have enhanced the political benefit resulting from the brain attack of notebooks have the same courage when presenting the facture to the state budget?
The sequence in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol No State is not comparable to payments in respect of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is infinitely infinitely when the minage is born by the life of its members.
Furthermore, less than considering that public expenditures are inadequate, these contributes to finance material and immaterial investments from the growth of tomorrow and thus future receipts.
Some of the answers.
A regulable decision.
But remember the sacred blessing of Hyppocrate: the health of the benefits of world pharmaceutical society must be maintained before all.
Good theory of the complot.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't correspond to your fantasma.
The medical personnel would like to use it, but they have the hands linked by the law as written by the policies.
It is the same situation as for the product that provides medical advantages instead of risking cirurgic interventions, the sales of sales sales for toxicomans instead of have them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, the politicians want to enjoy inculcate masses.
In fact, doctors don't win money with medicines.
That's why there are pharmacians.
Doctors don't win money with medicines Vis that Liberals want our health system like the United States, you should learn how it works.
In the world, the doctors are in the same way cursed, but it is more or less visible.
Perhaps it was a mal formulation of mistakes on toubibs, but the reality is only many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of business and research.
Read therefore some rare reports on our expenditures of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies related to other countries.
Compare the world prices of medicines partly, as well as the differences of one country to the other on what is free or only on order.
This is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific, direct or indirect process.
In fact, some enterprises do tests on marijuana inhalations against oncological sufferers, unless the laws that discharge them and the needed allowances.
Although the manufacturers of some medicines risk not to be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version offering good quality products to known doses will be widely benefited.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're threatening, it's a lot of things in the cools for doctors and pharmacies.
With regard to this hospital, they were happy to serve them until someone puts the puzzle in the ears of a responsible for this hospital.
We can't get a letter on the herb...
If researchers in social scientists were investigated instead of political and networking, they could be used their “employment. ”
A researcher, he doesn't compare a fact to another.
It's not looking for comparison.
Comparison is to make a pedagogic not research.
We can't say "the search is obviously needed to apply it" and then in a same jet "we need to experience everything."
If your research is achieved, why do you experience?
If your research is not surprised why you ask us to apply them?
May I explain how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who can't like mathematics only can easily make the mathematics and other materials?
The new technology allows you to learn the conditions that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they be learning new technologies if they don't know learn?
Pisa tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that we are satisfied.
What is it to build a indicator that reports you about what you arrange, an autopromotion voluntary, a trompery?
Only one track to form teachers: leave sophistics and ideals from training and teaching practices.
Fabrice refers to the paragraph on stages (which heas is not very argumented) and you will see your conclusion put us to the most ineffective conservation: "It is a device that leads before the reproduction of in force practices, and that does not allow to progress the system " .
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, only practices teach practices, even if they have all their place in a modern training of teachers
The theory of education must have no place.
Praticians, they must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a chirurg whose formation is purely theory, and who has never put the foot in a operator block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of educational problems.
Giving more risks to the theory of education, it would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogue is totally fair: if I wouldn't want to be operated by a practical practice that has only a theory training, I would still like to do less than to operate by a chirurg who has no theory education and who has learned on the board.
Mike Weatherley, the conservatory deputy carried on the fight against the violation of the author's right by David Cameron
Why don't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR Exmaires thank you.
If a day I begin to feel guilty to violate the author's right, I'll be enough to read a article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of the author's right = vol.
That's the same because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Sometimes, getting a licence doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of the author's right.
Not the same thing.
Using content without the appropriate licence, you take the artists of their guarantee.
You can always discuss pending hypotheses - but it's a flight.
And you can repeat it as you want, it won't happen for so true.
It's a violation of the author's right.
Come on, repeat it again.
If a day I begin to feel guilty to violate the author's right
Of course, it doesn't deserve you to private the artists of their income.
If they think they should receive the money for images used in school debts, a definition of nearly perfectly what should be a reasonable use, then I am glad to private them from this fixed income.
The Lex No. 1 should be shown how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they leave all intellectual property at the site according to the general conditions they have passed by a click.
Perhaps if they share the auditors of their mp3 baller with a copy in the school bus, they should be exhausted to have violated the law of such way.
Ah, if we could export this resource we'll regenerate, the roller who says that it's wrong...
If it's a PS deputy who confirms it, we must believe it.
I have two children, and when they're age to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France throws people down in assistants continually.
I don't want my children to support the debt that this policy would be created.
What the France takes to the bottom, these are the talks like yours.
@gus I work in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies guided by excellent companies: it exists in France but it is weird.
I'm sale because I know I don't have the competences to lead a company, and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the zero bodies I'm often meet.
In my baskets, I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: He said the terrible truth!
@gus, if it is compared to German companies that the French leaders continue to ask reforms in France, in Germany, enterprises have structured their industries for competent rate, particularly by ensuring the link between large enterprises and the media and small - What are the French patrons expecting to do so?
What does the State hold their hands?
That state they accused of empire?
@Jacques L.
Always this anti-leader of your party!
Remember me, what have you created as an employment, as a added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is confronted to an insolvency problem: the incompetence of non-competent French undertakings to create employment and to build and prevent by expecting the permanent assistance of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: elimination of the Code of Working, patron charges, posts, work 45h/week payed 35, and some, walking on eggs, are able to call down salts if they are disappeared!
I have not seen all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic see how people are always pleasing from the First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us.
They tried to keep a floor instead of transforming themselves.
It doesn't mean that the ways for schools are not better since Last is busy.
But they were also improved with their foreheads, including British Rail.
We don't have the power to do this, healy.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't.
But good, the Labour's gonna shoot us out of damn, isn't it?
It's an international office.
They already operated trains in Germany.
Nothing stops people in the United Kingdom to create a more moral business and to take part in offer calls.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our private services end by being managed by a stranger operator.
I remember the scandal and critical when First has submitted the Virgin contract, all that is that to finally cancel the decision.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has submitted Crossrail's exploitation contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they repeated to us during the Referendum campaign, is totally for the common and sharement and think that the workers all have to go through the borders.
It is therefore possible to suggest that they will be happy of this decision )
It may be because the management of the Netherlands is on good rails while the British is not it.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner, but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the latest possible choice, but the real problem is the crucial franchis system, not the franchisher.
"It was a bitching girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
Suppose that the fact of being "batting" is a higher quality than many others, the consciousness of others, the understanding, the hearing, for example, the fact of being "batting" is nothing to see with that to survive a disease: cancer "battants" who are not less dead, I know the palanchets.
Get out of a disease, there's nothing to see with the merit.
Come on, let's start again.
I don't tell you that it's the condition to guarantee, I tell you that it's AIDE.
There's nothing to see with some kind of merit...
When in your life examples, you only have to judge them.
I'll start again.
Instruction, isn't it just a moment, that we may have a worth to get out of a disease or that we can measure not to get out, it's just monstruous.
The body follows or doesn't follow.
A body that leads from everywhere, although the will, although the confidence in the medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I would like to think about the contrary, if, having a solid moral allows more easier to accept hard treatment and to prepare it, try experimental treatments such as this woman did and not refuse them with fear..
Someone who is fighting medically is before everyone who trusts the medicine.
But if we prefer to get back to the "Master" is something else.
Not with the merit or with the strength.
These considerations are proper to the moralists.
When you get a sale, a real thing, you're going to make sure you're going to become a zombie.
Personally, I got two, saleties, big, and if I'm "battu" as they say these psychological purposes, it's totally missing me.
Although this war is not only to smoke the dents, to suffer hell and to smoke the shoes.
I thought the accusation against Milosevic was decided and ended for a decade of years.
I didn't see this name in the journals at least this time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A birthday forgotten.
His process has been carried out quickly and then fallen under the tape.
Is that the story we told you at the time?
The communist became nationalist who declared three wars in Balkans during the last decade?
The Communist President of the Social Republic of Yougoslavia?
Please, ask what we wanted to leave on the side: 1.
How could the OTAN bombards be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack her?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you not mention that OTAN has destroyed the same building by killing citizens, and then it was considered a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to go out of it: if he would not defend his country against the OTAN attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defends him, he would be cut off by the western compressor.
Westerns used a smoke screen to disappear a part of a Sovereign State, which later declared its independentness and was immediately recognized by the West States who then lying on the situation on the ground.
The Serbia population has now completely lost (ethnic cleaning).
Vojilav Kostunica, which is mentioned here, has been dead politically after his first mandate, so that he has not understood the situation that was developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversy figures of the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not be the Milosevic of Tyran (ever if we don't love him).
My knowledge is only in Greece that a method of prevention of seems walks nearly closely, measured the piézo-electric level in the quarter.
This kind of study is increasingly useful and thanks for us to share the results.
So a hope is, but the proudness is the setting This water has nothing to see with the named HAT-P-11b exoplanet, located at about 124 light years of the Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be the “the smallest and frost planet to introduce detective water molecules”, according to a study conducted by Drake Deming team and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
So the method to follow.
Like those who influence animals feel a threat to come.
Thanks to the Scientific Passory for us, often, of these experimental evidence that are realized in the world.
How would animals escape (forward)?
No doubt, by the understanding of other elements which the tax is developed in the case of seisme.
Like the radio, for example.
A gas has an inodore priority for man, but maybe the animals are dealable.
All these methods are indetectable for man, but not for the measure instruments that he provides.
But we don't have faithful results on these tracks...
It was noticed (and since centuries) that some animals do a few hours amazingly with a seisme, including eggs, dogs, but especially fish and serpents.
I had seen a report on art reporting the fight of two scientist teams, one California, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that led animals to the sensitivity of animals to the earthly magnetic fields, and especially to their change before a sexy.
So I'm not scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me!
Or are we on these researchs?
Why is this track so much worse?
We should learn to hear the nature...
If we examine the things quietly and rigourously, it is published in a serious review, and no one disturbs it.
While we are talking about the "signs" given by the animals, it is the same weight: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seisme the red fish turned out weirdly around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did it too much as a lot in London.
When we listen to the LBC program, we can't stop think that this man doesn't know anything and that he always trys to divorce with a blague.
He never answers directly, although it is.
He also said that he was agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made a lot of promises to make himself elected as a master and he didn't hold it alone.
That's just to subline the rest of the Conservatory Party is just a fucking ramass, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's drunk.
He was in “Have I Got News for You. ”
Because it's a celebration and we've inculcated people the worship of celebrations.
The Londonians voted for him, and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and if) he takes the direction of the party, the popularity cost of the Tories will burn the ground I'm sure.
Let God help us.
I'm not so sure: people love false men, but they don't want their first minister to be one.
That's exactly what we said to the Londonians.
He should have brought his friend parpaing with him, more smarter than him.
I think he's trying to copy R. Branson.
The Americans have made it as President.
Frances are really and always deinterested of the History of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been given the pain of reading a few books (that exists, including a French and excellent B.
Milot), Solomon’s and the “herrail destroy ” speak, so unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
We understand that Australians, who know (one of their hard cross, Australia, must always be there by the background from Savo's battle), have not allowed to return there.
We are actually fulfilled before Savo's field, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission touchs its end.
That's the little ones.
But the echo cost is a total fumation.
Calculate the console cherozen to achieve the objective completely decreed the concept..
It's enough to explore the list of sponsors than philanthropes.

The vacuum, it's too living!
I'm waiting for the web series with impatientness!
Your rect makes me review, by identifying me a little while in the past (I also learned to ship with the Ellon Crocos in the Brest Moulin Blanc rade!).
Chapter also for the environmental message, meet if some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us back, and show with faith that Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red good that has shown against the impositions is happy to know that this travel is sponsored by the British Region and Brest City.
I feel seriously that local collections and public organisms of all kinds should not make a sound of our purposes to finance the dreams of some avenues even sympatically than those there!
Is there a player in the current Serb training that is cosovary origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, early in the Juventu and now in Fenerbahia, are from Mitrovic, but I don't know if they're still in the team
It's Bisevac's Defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of land or before in the 70s and 80s and entered many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he played as a attacking in the great team of Velez who, under the lawyer Suleman Rebac, ended twice in the Yougoslav Library (and also counted points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsenne Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thanks Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
We said he was going to be a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he was appeared on my radar screen he was connected to Blackburn *frisson*
There I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and I know there is no titler.
Maybe he can do something else, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Really, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're near.
The thing is that this drone's drop is not the track of the real Albania today.
It seems that it was the flag of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Happy, there's no too much dealing (I know).
In fact, it was a albanian travel with the map not of what it is called the Great Albania, but from Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give up of the country to the neighbor countries.
How can we feel "a joy explosion" seeing two tours smoking out of knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
This is a bit of me in this "the testimony" is that the only thing that could have been, is it only, to joy spontaneously of the terrible death of thousands of people, testify my eyes of a "border line" person, which all "the witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Unfortunately, at the short time of "joy," we will not have thought about the dead or the reality of the infected horror.
We would just think, a moment, that, for a time, Muslims had succeeded to do real and apocalypticly bad to the great wicked Satan in his heart even.
To make a powerful shit.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims rounded by their feelings of humilation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic shaden happy.
We've got a little bit.
The West "Christian/Blanc/Gulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, wrath, hate of museum when he contempts the general measure, social and cultural development of the Arab Arabian world today.
I'm talking about Chair or Alger's faubourgs, not Dubai tours.
The past brilliant, of course, is not a consolidation, in contrast.
How did the muslim world go out of this diabolic tone?
Totally in the phase, 2 major fish disregulars the Arab world l: the conservative behavior of powers and fascistness.
The common point, the yellow of the thought and the excommunication (douce or army) of its critical expression.
What we have understood before, you don't have to make the Musulmans back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I think it's true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the highway marks the beginning of six long-term, humble and depressive months that affect the welfare and humor of many people.
In addition, everybody's sick.
Saison depression.
I suffer it myself.
When the light goes, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamine D should be helped a little for humor and goodness.
The highway is beautiful in British, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the suffle in a car.
Not so much to cut the suffle as the green of the age when everything is alive instead of be on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you have the chance, the age falls a weekend.
We've been a beautiful year, don't make your kids that turns the cuts!
Not everyone.
I'm ill in the hiver.
But now I'm at the retreat and I'm not developing immunity in the outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about death, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of inverterous orphans, with a febrility that smokes with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Noël, the risks of injection and full of other wonderful words.
It's enough to stop doing things!
This is my recommendations for the feasts for you.
Yes, these dark and green months make me really more happy and more happy.
For the fiscalisation of the majorities for children , it is the cost of the State which is essentially providing decades 8 to 10.
However , in respect of the number of feeds that have seen their imposition to increase after this measure , it is particularly the decimal 4 and 5 concerned ( medium income ) in accordance with the graphic 2 .
The elimination of half part of the widows in particular is not of all the Treaty in the article or at least its effect is completely assessed: 230M euros is a pleasantry that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and understood that it is indolory.
And it's not ready to get up.
Well, we're not on the wall, but singers.
For one time the PS makes a policy instead of the left, we're not gonna cry...
It is clear that those who are part of 20% of the most rich must support more than 75% of the highest of the imposition, why not 90%?
Let's continue and encourage these 20% at least work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm telling it once.
Live the Trots and the OCI recycling in the PS: they all included.
Adam, you see what you look at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrein: 20% of the population is 80% of riches.
A equitable imposition is when he prohibits anyone to do so much as he can.
At a certain limit, the money loss all its use.
And once the use of money is over, the money is not more than to do money, it's ) to do the worst of the greatest.
We are part of 20% of the most rich.
Unfortunately, 20% of families working most (and create the riches which a part is logically relied).
A equitable imposition must allow these families to benefit from a part of their efforts.
Or then so much down the arms and live social minimums, especially if we have a social apartment .
The outops of the heads of the red khmer have happy lived.
I made two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have been in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present us to the receipt or to face the front of tracks.
It's enough to go to someone, to sleep there, to rent back and to split.
It's my first option when I'm in the travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Please check your confidence before you praise your house.
In most cases, you will need a type of property insurance.
Please use a service with the good logo!
Oh, sixth hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risked" It's not true.
You just missed happiness.
According to the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's answer was quickly quickly, fast.
In 24 hours, after a mail offered to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a lock to change the locks, took provisions to pass a week to the hotel and transfered 23 817 dollars (for which Airbnb is ensures, but even).
So why does this article quote the Teman rejoice that it has not received support of Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello, I'm looking for people who have already used the bnb air just to save me.
I'm looking for a payment and a month to pay for a couple, but I'm a little afraid to send 1 600 £ to a site that I've never heard talking.
But where are we going?
“ Support the bodies, ” says Bu$herie over all tons...
So unopenive weapons.
I'm sure that this will make it pleasure to families and near the thousands of dead cords in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have hunted something else than the chemical bombs of home saddam.
Although the contents of the article were rarely modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (for staying poli).
Furthermore, what would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered about 20 years later were still useful?
It isn't hyper to clear the style of the author: "for the search of massive destruction weapons.
We're all agreed.
You think it's the time to build the army to strengthen education
It's never the time to strengthen education, because we're still in war.
Alternative: TOJOURS is the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
The education would have already been strengthened if we had 'they' worked 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
At the time, our teachers now win more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers will pass 18 hours per week to prepare their programme.
But it doesn't seem because the National Education doesn't have ways to provide a office to college/lycea to his profession, so they bow home.
A kind of telework forced, except that the employer does not pay the computer nor the Internet connection, nor the providers.
Furthermore, it's so the plane at 17 hours per week and 4 months of vacation that we don't get to fill the Math CAPES, come, we're waiting for you.
How doesn't you want to cut you out bad educated cards that parents crack you up in the treatment of branch?
I think the priority in this area is to disarma the djihads so that the khurde population may be better scanning.
There we see that the Bush administration has completely done through.
My first employment was in the sale, London, to win three times nothing, and it was a place for which he needed a diploma.
One year later, I saw an announcement to be opened for the London metre, it was paid $5,000 per year, and we didn't even ask the letter.
I've never made it.
In this regard, don't do that if you don't find a diplomed job, try to find something or paying good, or if you like to do.
If I stayed in the diplomatic works, I would still pay my student payment.
I don't like the business work so much, so I hope to go in the public function or in the university world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I received my diploma in 2011, there was already three years ago.
The best way to reduce the number of diplomas without work?
It is to be disappointed by bicycles such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is what we call the coma diplomas.
I have one of these diplomas, and I've finished the production director.
It appeared that the matter was not the diploma, but, as the article above, a good professional park, starting in school and all over the university.
Of course, the department salary was lower but we've moved quickly because in the real world it's the results of knowledge.
This discussion of engineer and artistic daughters has been a long time since years.
The scientists cannot resolve all the problems, it is more important to be able to rise on the morning, to get work at the time and to interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and arts are bisuan philosophers?
It's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about diploms of a type of medium study or whatever the unconscious philosopher you've gone.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and arts are of real daughters.
We need people who can explain the major issues to the schools, which include the importance of culture bases such as literature, art, etc., and make them value.
Does it not be better for a real territorial policy to disengorge Paris and dynamishing the rest of France?
Personally, I see the inhabitants of Eson and Val-d'Oise to make 80km back every day to come to work in Paris.
The inside walls and small ceintures have already many transport methods in common otherwise more practical (meter, bus, tramway).
> More safe and closed parks, as already exists in North Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the tour.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2RM.
Incidentally, we hope that Paris City works with professionals of the Netherlands and Denmark.
To benefit from their great experience in the area.
Well, we didn't find a place for UN SEUL steaming device.
The motivation seems stronger when it's going to find a office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Okay, it's not all right.
When they are discussed with pietons and other users of common transport for reasons for which they don't lose, I think that the main reasons that are resident are: 1/ is dangerous with all these bathrooms, these cars, these scooters who roll over quickly and disappear of the surveys 2/ are filled with pollution in the head For me the cyclable tracks are going, it is necessary to reduce automotive circulation (urban type of loading), reducing the visa (Paris = 30 zones), respecting the code of rolling in the system-wide (which is to prevent that the code of cycletable tracks is going to go to ship, it must reduce the automobile circulation (invisible type of loading), reducing the visa (Paris = 30 zones), respecting the code of the rolling in the rolling system with the grounds of the same (the cyclears needs to prevent the code to be write the write the code for the write to write to write to write the rolling for the rolling rolling for the ships of the ships of the rolling rolling rolling, and the box of the rolling ranges of the ranges of the ranges of the ranges of the rolling ranges of the ranges of the ranges, and the ranges of the ranges of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the ranges of the ranges of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the ranges of the range of the ranges of the ranges of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the ranges of the age of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the ranges.
The cycleable tracks are from apartheid, we need to cooling but to re-equalize the occupition of the town space.
Nothing on the floor in the Great Paris?
Not a word on the place of the floor in common transports?
EELV is right.
The objective of 15% of velo movements is ridicule.
I'm starting to believe that Anna Hidalgo rolled the green in the farine.
In addition to what OR reports, the EELV annexes seem sceptic.
I prefer to be optimist.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hide behind this massacre.
Indice: it's not Russia.
Not sure to love the way the world develops.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial activity.
A lawyer expressed his intention to take the case before the CEDH, but I didn't hear that a statement was actually deposited.
Furthermore, it should be that they should first put a statement in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases are replaced by expecting the result of the investigation report on accident and criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libia didn't explore Pan Am 103 no more.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault is committed to the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukraine Government.
Did the accident be previsible?
Other aircraft had been attacked before, Ukraine launched in the area of aircraft attacks against rebels, and all aircraft could certainly be considered as an immediate and immediate threat.
Does the Ukraine Government have taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has chosen to play with the life of innocents to pay air companies the rights of override of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev thrones that defend their user-pattern government / the ultra-nationalists of the West Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate greatly that Poutine has attacked the MH17 floor.
As I know, there is already a statement against the Government of Kiev because they are responsible for what happens in their heavens.
Previously: A decision of 1986 of the International Court of Justice concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the rebellious forces of the Contracts in Nicaragua does not mean that the United States were responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia leaves this case to the CIJ.
It is fun to think that Abbott means to Poutine that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to establish his allégations.
Before the investigators haven't said anything like this.
It's called Ricardo and being such a scootin, it's amazing!
It's called Poland is to lose the north is happy.
One only question: is that the poor today is more poor than the poor yesterday?
I can't try to note that those who criticize most virally the Picketty's book didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I've put a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of work investments, capital property, value and heritage in the term.
He shows that the concentration of the capital today is at the beginning of 20th before 1914, he shows that it is the two world wars that have been low to the concentration of the capital, from 1914 to 1945, and how the concentration reaches after...
Bernajuzan: You don't say anything.
I ask you how long this has taken you to read this box knowing that a person's concentration capacity has some limits.
Then, the question is not to know if it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central threat given the pressure is just or not.
If it is true, we can discuss it without reading the book which the essential is to argument in a unique sense for it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you set for reading this?
Is that the central threat of his pope resumed by the press is failure?
I didn't read, and I didn't read it.
So I believe in the summary of his central threat, and this is the one that appears to me pure fumestery.
The notation of disappearance between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Isn't the humanity increasingly?
And this increase added to a growth of the population is the true political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive person and measures the price without doubt.
But remember that she's just 17 years old.
A age in which most people begin just to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a farm for the young girl and she will find her way to bring a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of the West Governments who want to prove the old addition according to which the colored pervers are the incarnation of the evil.
All my bodies of happiness in Malala, but she must be considered that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or others - even in the popular quarters of England!
Someone thought his conversation was a little strange.
She thanked her father to have given her a lot of freedom, but she mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married for 14 years.
Does it not be part of these "colored perverse"?
You shouldn't have any 'anti-time' on this site.
You're a terrible pervers.
That's absolutely revolutionary.
No, his father didn't want to marry her for 14 years.
She had 15 years when we shot him up.
His father leads a school where girls are schooled and it is for the equality of the rights for women.
He is, and has always been, to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide himself from her marriage.
In the same way, there is a man in Pakistan in the way he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that a medium Pakistan girl often needs to marry for 14 years without having a word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't make it a lot of lot for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe she wants to say that if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married for 14 years.
Plutôt discovered by this input in saison 4 and particularly by Jessica Lange, which seems to be a little bad to find his personality of Marlene Dietrich's society.
I came to look at the last two inches that are very different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best horrors, one of the most obvious!
A first fascinant episode.
The realisation is near the perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing the Life Anachronic on Mars of Bowie is just turning around.
I haven't still looked at this new saison (which will be the last for me, without Lange Bof Bof Bof).
In the case of the American Horror Story, I prefered to have a chance of looking at 13 episodes at 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is, outside Jessica Lange, is especially the risks of scenas and mounts sitting in me.
In AHS, we have an alarg of original plans that do not redicule the adaptation of today's production.
It's a little bit of me to see you get the episode for the next ones we're inside without even waiting for the power to fulfill the quality.
Jessica Lange is sure a piler of this series, but you say it so well, there are other things still.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially his way and how it uses it) is actually UN of the series pilers outside the technical qualities.
And a good bar I'm looking for her very much.
Then I find that the series of sins by writing, she wants to do things too much at the same time.
The saison 3 was easily low, in the 2 was too spread, although some excellent episodes were spread.
I don't see them doing 10 insects of American Horror History or it's gonna end like 24 hours of time.
But everybody does what he wants!
It's because I say "I'm not going to watch again" that everyone is obvious to do this!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she's gonna be fatal.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less than the heights of posts, please - we're cutting in the expenditures of the State.
No, let's increase the expenditures, please.
Those who wanted to save in expenditure failed.
Declaration of polemics on expenditure relatively small, such as development aid
The problem is that it represents less than the error margin in the expenditure of the Government in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuds instead of the change of orientation that the electorers seem to call their own heart and all this time, in each camp, they look like these nuds are very important and substancely as they are - and the electors see clearly in their game and find them bad faith.
1% of the expenditure.
The "dependence" is essentially employed by financial institutions in this country.
The "date" is nothing to be concerned.
I wouldn't see any problem that the Government applys a third of my income (before even speaking taxes on consumption) if I thought he was going to use it as well.
But this is not the case, and many contributions have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not very honest in how to reduce the impositions but well, if you add our net contribution to the EU, high speed 2, subventions to the Olympics at least inutile and nuclear centres that cost the duplicate of what they should, you will come to a number that makes well ridicule the labour and Lib-Dem's contribution on the most luxury residences.
Your first 10 000 £ are not possible.
This means that someone who wins 35 000 £ per year about 50,000 £ (the seventh of their salary), someone with 50 000 £ would pay around 10 000 £ (a fifth), etc. and someone with 200 000 £ about 70 000 (a fewer than one third).
What about social quotations?
More than social costs, more local pockets, more staining costs and car rental wine, and it is before the TVA.
Exactly 30% of my money is preliminary to the source before the local pockets and the car wine.
I'm paying a decade, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my imposes.
But don't let us believe that the money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billion books are passed.
How can a camera who looks for work at the door can prove it?
Even though, 20% of the colmonists wouldn't look for, it means that 80% are looking for and not finding.
If I'm a coma, do I have more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recipe 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances now.
In fact, I did not have any news from Pole Emploi for months, that means that the agents are more occupied in control operations than to really return employee announces?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not the State to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough posts, then it is necessary to pass from Pole Emploi.
What is it about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and debts, in the case, it is ensuring that the officers fulfil their debts in contrast to their rights.
As a controller requests their transport titles to users of a transport method, a service captain, or the payments of their work, etc.
Nobody calls the scandal in these cases, right?
It is really good to remember that the officers have rights: the only two times I had done at Pole Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been wrong established, and on one of the items, amputated of 40%, he had not had to fight close.
This takes time!
I'm not an expert right.
The fixing and control is currently taken, while statistically Pole Emploi is near to be a security company.
I would add that the subject of the indemnisation should be concerned only the salaries, these are those who pay the costs.
The non-Salarian politicals and non-Salarians have the rights they have not!
It's not normal.
I would add that an assessment insurance is worthy to participate in the assessment of the salary work.
More than waiting for twice killers in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military answer in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not expect this conflict area.
The situation would then seem like the propagation of the black pest in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the movement of populations at the time.
The Saudians had the presence of interrupting the Hadj to Mecca to the Muslim Pearls from three touched countries.
The country reports that 7 400 have seen their requests of visa refused for their origin country or their recent travellers.
In fact, there was the case of a pearl come from Bosnia that contracted the variable to the Mecque during the Hadj in the 80s, probably counted by a pearl come from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Does it be without heart propose to prevent Ebola's diseases to take a fly for Europe?
I thought it was a simple sense but apparently those "who knows" decided that we could risk the life of ten thousands of people...
These countries of West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be set in 40 strict.
Nobody's lucky.
Only the health personnel can enter.
21 days after they had treated patients before they could go.
If they contract Ebola's virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healthy.
There are no dracony measures.
Nothing that the last week, people have been counted after having contacted with people in West Africa, well they have taken “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the adventure of this disease.
She is mainly propagated by air companies.
Let's interview them to offer flying to these countries.
Furthermore, the douan agents in the airport should be formed to repeat people who represent typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they may be immediately in 40.
That it comes to pass the message of the first and group (including religious) second, and he will measure the Nobel of Peace.
I doubt that it is able to be in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in function.
It's still far from this concept.
This is only 20 years ago that the information appears as the first data of humanity, while the religion, out of the brain leads our actions from Lucy.
What is interesting to become a first protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, the Catholicism is a largely minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere it.
Those who criticate do not put the feet in the church anyway, only to see the low number of protestants in France.
What's the next step, we remove sin notion, too anxiogene?
@loise: Sorry the church has no limited view in France.
And in the world, it may be possible to touch more than the world...
@Martine E, to be honest (come normally), the respect of others as you consider it is preexistent to the Christian.
He said, "Don't do to others what you don't want to do to you, it's all the Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study."
The Christianity is well far from a simple reciprocy but brings the attack.
Your "do not progress justice, peace, brotherness" but without God?
Is it a return to the communism? :-)
Next step: We remove incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has built the moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to achieve their role in the ethical discussions of our society and to progress justice, peace, brotherness.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the low number of protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their elders have been extermined and turned into the immigration a few centuries ago.
I've been too much between buying this, the new game Alien, or Wasteland 2.
And Elite's the new game out soon.
It doesn't happen.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his funding campaign) but I don't think that it's 30 £.
If it's the PC version you're interesting, Green Man Gaming is currently sold SoM to 30 £ and also offers a good reduction of 20 %.
Green Man Gaming is currently sold SoM to 30 £ and also offers a good reduction of 20 %.
I'm gonna look at it.
Of course not to work.
The information department's joys locks all the sympa sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ and 20% reduction, or does the 30 £ include the 20 % of reduction?
However, attention: PC version is only for DX11.
I'm surprised, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I buyed him on Steam, so there's no remuneration, it's no.
It's time to buy a new video card * do the eye*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emperor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would have fear that one day they would do the effect of your library if they decide to sevir against people who buy it there when they are out of the foreign region.
So gather Elite's beta version: dangerous.
So, the France in 1940 was it a putrid land?
So say, this Nobel price looked for me as a present gift.
You need to love France's 40, the "the strange default"?
When we see who get the literature Nobel is asked if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we can't even read the original authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano who is already hardly readable in French and who describes a universe so limited and egocentrated?
I hope the other Nobels are more confident but I'm sure it is.
Modiano, Levy, Musso has only a remote report with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel price?
It would be better to judge.
Don't worry about Chinese, Brazilians and others.
Foreigners are very sensitive to literature and French culture, they.
They will be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his right value, if they don't know him anymore!
From your side, continue to fresh Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
Then let's see who has received the literature Nobel: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello. Hi, honey.
Since I led one in Iceland, I can't stop see Kia Sports all around.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to overwrite me?
Or was I like the horrible Superman III computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate her?
Hello, DQ - no, not today, I took my medicines.
It's a mercredian!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend, I went to the fish and circle of Nottingham.
It was a bordel.
I succeeded with 19 different beasts, Wobbly Weasel as one of my favorites.
I was gratefully surprised by the medium of people there, there were only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the fanatics of the camera).
It was really hard to drive on the Sunday return.
Monday we went to the Grand Dad of a Pop to play the nine brag card.
Thanks to a real chance of starting, I could share with several decades.
I hope if I get 95 years, I'll be as alive as he's.
I went to a chick cocktail bar last night to Farringdon.
One of my drinks came up with a lad smoke.
I admire M.
Read a little Bouddha, and you will understand what mistakes you do, darling Christian.
This says, without trying to contrary you, I think you're going a little away from the subject.
This fame totality, she prohibited the search for the Djihadists at the exit of the muscles.
She signs without late weapons trafics.
So we have great eyes open, such as Meddeb and Taija or Boubaker, and we have the eyes closed.
We need to choose.
It's not keeping closed eyes that we're accessing the light.
Excuse me, darling Christian, but again, you make a monumental contrast: the totality of authorities, organizations or associations representatives, Muslims or not, having formally condemned the EI and its crimes, French, Muslims or no, have nothing to add to these official offences.
He doesn't say a word.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, sweetheart Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I said thousands of times, some dozens of the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and independent of the accusation of them before and require them publicly to prove the rest of the French society that she was wrong to do it.
This principle is to me the negation of the Republic and can only contribute to deliver the French society.
I'm not sure that it's like to say.
Who doesn't say a word consent, but what do you agree?
A neighborhood with EI or the EI condemnation.
The silence is well practic, it's the main weapons of those who want to mix the chair and choice.
Your position is intellectually honest but practically intentable.
Alex Salmond predicted that the Ecosse could, when elections, "gain" parts represented in Westminster because a great footnote has been broken between their decentralisation proposals and what they have promised in the view of the independence reference.
Cameron needs to be petrified in the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron needs to smile.
What's these threats?
The Conservatives were fully disappeared from the Ecosia seeing they have no sitting there.
They can do what they want in all electoral immunity.
I don't think that even Cameron is so stupid to believe that the Labour lost seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna make a lame for the Working Party.
They will be fully eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their head in the north.
Ed Miliband was joined to the "PROMESSE" thinking he saved his party, but without acknowledging that he signed the death of his economy deputy.
It is not wonderful that some of the Works Members ask accounts to their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in the Parliament, even if the seats don't come from the Conservatives, they will then be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can strengthen the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they have promised for a maximum decentralisation.
I think it's the most important thing.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatory want to be held a day in England.
Call 8% pomps at detriment of 85%, it is not a super electoral strategy.
Furthermore, when the Economic Deputys will not vote any more on the issues concerned in the English, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he's.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband is.
Maggie made it with Ulster's unionists, and that's what happened to him.
However, it is still lawful to be the first Minister in 2015 and since he has submitted the direction of the Working Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look up and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the top.
It's "The Life of the others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
In terms, it will be at least a sterilisator effect.
I'm waiting for the next ballet: Amazon VOTRE fabric free by VOTRE profile and this automatically through an algorithm of its secret!

Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implied, I remain reading of pirate files, books of the public area or buying to some editors who have the intelligence of offering files without mugard.
Looking at the price I paid Kobo, it's unreasonable.
I am avoided from the generalized addiction of users against the generalised approval of their private life.
In your large public library, you will notice systematically that everyone gives his faithful card (fn*c, d*itre, ...).
There are also required officers, where opening and completed rates are doubtless disorders.
For example, “Finegans Wake ” of James Joyce.
@Thomas: During the Big Data age, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention to not put all literature in the same bathroom.
The anonymous data collection when there's a profile...
The collection is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo, which are not allowed to identify the readers or the authors.
But Kobo has all these information, he.
There were such exaggerated, misunderstanded and contradicts of the Turkish government in the last days that the country seemed to be guided by a full room class of skizophrene children under acid.
It's still worse that if you take care of the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan.
It is interesting that some party of Erdogan thinks that islamist is such an insult that they suspect your comment but not my.
You see:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot a ball in the feet, less to win something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will answer, so it's actually shopping a ball in the feet.
A diplomat on his blog writes: "The AP report that Iran has kept the United States that it would be a mistake to reverse the president of Sirian Bachar Al-Assad because this would be in danger of the security of Israel.
It is not clear in the article if Iran sent there a serious advertising of representatives or if it would just advise proudness.
This second option is more probable and, in all cases, what is really surprised is that today the Iranian and America's diplomatic enhancement on Syria, Israel and the Security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to recommend strongly to anyone who take care of the details instead of the c*news balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read by maintaining the previous observations of Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are those “modified ” who are seriously fighting the terrible Assad laick and at the same time the perverse of ISIS?
The policy of the pipelines takes the world to the surface, and I would suggest those who refer to nonexistent "modified" to make more attention to the facts and alternatives before they send children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"Is it still worse that if you take account of the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan" Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East power?
I got one in my head.
There would be a process of Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide commissioned by the Turkish.
Does he “beyond“?
Do you know that no criminals or victims have the chance to be alive?
A little later for that, my boss...
Isn't the criminals going to be age now, about 120 years?
A little later for that, isn't it?
Especially on the CUP triumph that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the first World War for vengeance by the Armenians, and sending by the bulcheviks in a poor place of Central Asia at least at the same time, when there was dreaming to fund a turc empire there.
What a damn thing!
An impressive master of the sophism of the fatal pent, but in addition to this, we only look forward to contact with the real.

The importance of the matter is that this practice is covered to limit the "marching" of the body.
But the ethnic chirurg, cosmetics are not also marching the body?
Anakronic Variance...
It is sure more elegant to grow a good in remote countries through Internet and Pay Pal than to get its responsibilities and or to escape the scandal in another century nearby home without crying him at this time on all bottoms! ...

There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
It's not less than the body exploitation is a real problem.

I don't know why there's so bad comments about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for some years!
I think in the sport section there is a article on the foot that waits for your comments.
Super article, very true.
From the film of Tony Parson, there is a penalty of reports that really reflect the reality of the North England culture.
Nothing amazing that Paul Mason has made well the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul has always lived, but it has been vampired by capitalism and today is a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can shoot a ears if you are in the region of London in November: 99psoul will go again from a soul wine, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Bethsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "alway the same story," but this is a little writer and well thought.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentation.
I suppose you're happy to get out in Newsnight.
Last train for Victoria/Exchange and descend to Wallgate.
They're kidding pills.
What's the garage before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes on the feet of Wigan after I bought a ballet for the stop after Victoria!
The starts of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently titled Gently Northern Soul, which goes to Newcastle in 1968.
The matters become more increasing.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never takes an opportunity to raise a opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou doesn't seek peace because he wants to continue to occupied-coloniser (in addition, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electorers all prefered the occupation-colonization of peace.
He took his clothes, put them on the rock and entered into the water.
A Israelian had fled them.
The representative of Israel rise up in anger and voted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even here at the time."
The Palestinian representative (ONU) is raised and added: and now that the things are clearly established
Israel and the most people have no confidence in the Bipolary Government of the Palestinian authorities and will not be able to cut down the guard...
This moves to ancient Israelites is an evidence, it is not the target searched...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translated: the World Geopolitic Report ...
And it's still so since the political is globalized...
Evitation, evitation...
In the conflict of Israele-colonialist, for the creation of Palestinian state, it's sure, it's lost!
You don't answer for the creation of Israel.
What strength report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Antisionist: the conflict of Israel-Palestina is still a strong report today!
You're doing it?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In addition, it doesn't just turn around Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a bad way to go over whatever it was not to say.
Many of what he says is only pseudo-chomskystes written not others.
This is the one who proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a sequence of personal attacks and injections (a 13-year-old daughter loves it well, which would mean that it's a question of immorality).
A very vital charge, with just a suspect of conscience that Russell Brand says some truths, maybe truths that we prefer not to think.
Come on, this feeling will be more increasing!
I can understand why Brand is horrified: sometimes he speaks pretensively and after all the absurdities of the tableds, he actually gives the impression of being a starting population, but all this story of not voting has been completely interpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be just to speak to people to not vote and more than to cross the arms and ignore all the political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/video that he has posted, he says that vote once every 5 years only for the Labour or Conservatory (or Lib Dems) and limit the democratic engagement to this is completely inutile, the two parties (a lower degrees), which are essentially in favour of parts, multinational and riches, he does not just say to ignore the political party that the political party should not be entire to our local organizations, and that they should not be intended to achieve the more political levels, but they would not be intended to be increasing the political levels, but they would not have to do so much more.
I don't say that I'm necessary to agree with his solution (cause I think it's politically active by presenting his requests can go to peace with the fact of voting, seeing that politicians are turns that will change the opinions if they are really risking to lose the elections), but it's amusing to see all these consecutive answers who say that this unbelievers who says to the young people to not take the pain of vote and just hope that everything is better because it's really deforming his arguments.
His solution is extremely discreet and it would be well if people discussed about what he really said, instead of just to label it as an irresponsible and to put the concerns of him and a large number of persons for account.
Yes, thank you.
The vote has been completely deformed.
The unfortunateness of rolling a bulletin in an urin every 5 years I am deeply seeing my vote really doesn't care for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and deputy who are located in the presence of their electorers.
In addition, I believe that the proposals of Russell Brand are not his own (written by others).
It is enough intelligent to have its own and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the type of thoughters and universities that Suzanne would like to roll under the "Pseudo-chomskystes" label.
I am immediately convinced that in a discussion he would succeed to convince Suzanne.
Perhaps this is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne makes as Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, and even the r heads added to the mount!
As Max Keiser, who at the beginning attacked Russell, but ended by being one of his fans and invited him to his emission, is too easy to attack him without really understand where he wants to come.
It is in a political talk that exists from generations, but it has been marginalised by traditional media - including the Guardian - from generations.
This "frande" reveals especially in my eyes that the intellectual debate is not longer at the RDV of the History where the medium story storys have become minor and where specialist changes have appeared to the benefit of prejudiced type Sciences Po for pressure folders.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu, as well as the Michel Foucault, a need to take a criminal, an emissary bow.
They develop one and another of very rational reasons, but this rationality reposes on these emissary bows that are the key of their thoughts.
In addition, I believe that for Foucault the State was essential as innocent.
This reaches a very archical thought, the sacrificed thought, which is also the magic thought.
We resolve the problem of the report to the other in eliminating.
There is an anarchistic, neo-lib and / or / or /libertary pente ( from two terms the second marks a duration of the exradication desires of the State , the first knower to go to search for the security of the State for its markets ) in the meaning of at least / not of all State in Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is very organized.
His thinking is built on the crime of the State: without this sin, it does not stand.
Who says guilty, the elimination, the murder, the victim.
This is not a position against the three cited intellectuals here .
No support else.
The left totalitary remembers the good old time, the god of others, Staline, the little father of the people.
Oulala, you've probably read a choice too fast if you took the texts of Foucault on the Iran revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent wouldn't be happy to attack Michel by this...
Left is a deep thinking on the contemporary individual and collective, on the difficulty that represents the accession mechanism in our advanced Liberal society.
Whatever we agree or not with him is a original and respective thought.
See this challenge orchestrated by human researchers in the left hard sciences that don't support that we're able to pass away from their mantras.
Narcicism and authorism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add, I seem to be the posture of these "rebelles" which is only intellectual and theory.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows ” which I was witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't happy to hear our Australian friends about that, then.
And where was Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese last time.
In London and they were sympatical about me when they learned that I was Russia.
In Russia, in 1990, the last time in a market.
The Chinese thinks like the Whites!
My family lived in Australia after he arrived from Hong Kong and Guangzhou for a long time in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them to have anti-Blancs violation proposals.
My father's not happy that his old daughter's gone with a White.
I believe also that the attitudes have changed in Russia since 1990 and especially during the last years: they are more rich, prosperity propagates outside the large cities, and through this prosperity people walk outside and see how others live.
From what I said, the Russians had especially prejudiced against temporary workers without the original quality of Caucase and Central Asia, working in meters and areas where they have a great chance to be explored by their employers or confronted with an elevated crime and violence.
Although I lived on the rivers of the Ienesi River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of the Australians on the Chinese and the Aborigians.
It's really amazing that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met them two in my life (with one foreign), I didn't keep bad reminders, all people are worthy and, in fact, the Londons were very gentle. That's the only reason that I remembered that they were Chinese.
If we don't remember whom we meet, all people are worthy, how to remember who it was.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And however, you're always going out with the White Leader.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
No one, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would attack them.
There are no measures of the impartiality of justice.
However, it's the mother of all wars and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the guidance syndicate...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the judicial environments are frankly marked.
When at the Office Syndicate, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality may be made from relationship with the implementation of the laws in the courts, it orders to exceed two obstacles.
This is the political view of the observer as the actual interpretation of the Court.
It remains then the necessary tool of the law to recreate the evaluation on fundamental assessments.
The measure of its inobservation in all the courts acts of judges, including, forces to operate a distinction between the error and the partiality of the judges.
It would be just to suggest that the acts of justice would not be divided between these three groups.
Presentation and unconsciousness does not relate to a target analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, how would the justice be improved in France?
If it's only by statistics that are implicitly clear that it's a lower part.
The previous preambule allows well to write what is followed in the third relationship.
The Corruption* of the Government.
Sensible subject in proportion of the power of noise* which is convinced to the judiciary institution capable of such heritage.
The area considered is the spoliation* of heritages committed to the procedure* by successful genealogists mandated by notes.
This profession reaches an evil year 150 million euros by benefiting the coverage* safe by the presumptuary judiciary* of the French note.
For the understanding of their mechanism, one part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is ladite statistical improvement* amended by the previous commentary, the judicial institution has produced in many differences between generic and heritage to be so spoiled, all of the jurispruddens against all the laws concerned with the hereafter.
The presentation of European statistics that ignore this kind of racial criteria is then a form of liar?
Prices, sure, totally prohibitive.
More of the material to arise the hacked.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these tricycles all the grounds, built on a measure to its size and its steel, and it really allowed him to use the full air as never a normal roller, with roads and pneus, couldn't.
As we say, gold and colors...
The Tankchairi seems that Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a deficit in Top Gear.
The Tankchair is the EPIQUE.
I think Whill's inventioner has never been cleaning a dog crazy on a cheek.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the ground, but it's just too sweet.
The long-term long-term steel would be perfect for a hacked with a long-board penchant.
There are collines that would like them.
The prices seem to be effectively high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a floor, then “see. ”
The tricycle all the grounds looks particularly useful.
All the happy are not poor, however.
Many of them have the provision of assessments of a reasonable amount.
Only if they were hunted.
The thing is that the market of the ruling steel is a smoke, so they can perform high prices for things they know constantly that we are needed.
We can't really say that Whill is minimalist.
It's a excessive design example.
Unfortunately, it's just a crazy, it's not supposed to make it.
I am convinced that the running "long distance" is not on the market, because there is no way to drive this fish.
20 000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, in intensive bombs of resident quarters deeply deeply robbery.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blog of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupant power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
The half is children and young people who have less than 18 years.
Eight years old children lived all their lives under Israel's blocks!
Single situation in the world, inacceptable situation, illegal situation, even because this block affects a “collective pain ” with all Gaza citizens.
" Employers who work on their projects turn a little from their circle to the black market " ...
Oh, that's not the wood language, at least in beton, and the lady's armed...
The references are here to support a argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
It's good to the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's true, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blog of Gaza since 2007.
Only situation in the world, inacceptable situation for everyone who has a heart and moral sense.
United States have a well-guarded area: Saoudite Arabia.
Morsi has not been the time necessary to govern because the dictature (only by whom you know) has excluded it!
Don't forget it even after you got her up, Morsi had restored the block!
And I'm a West, so I agree...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel and Egypt...
Gaza's children live on a subterraneous force, building around the population who chose his masters!

Couchsurfing is more cool than Airbnb.
This is the definition even of the party economy, without a luxury purpose.
Many are looking for a couple of night on Couchsurfing.
So it's going to pay (or at least hope) in another way.
It's still lower than a hotel, if you need to look for the good addresses.
Furthermore, the owners and lots who trust themselves are often stopped using Airbnb and treated directly in species, around Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
“What does she put in place on ”?

The increase of riches between the hands of the most rich is a reality.

The capitalism doesn't open!
The high finance, particularly, plays with our companies, therefore, with our first materials, so our achievements, we give our food, and our health structures, so our health structures, so with our gifts of our institutions.
They're a threat in our daily life by the same and our money they're departing..
All this is for the benefit of some hyper-mega obsesions of the fridge.
Before the evidence of the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is the financial."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he called an elder of the Economy in Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of the banksters, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Is there anybody other competent?
You're calling this how: return his clothes, down his pantalon?
Primary and popular reaction
In fact, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because Germans refused to save the survivors.
I am not sure that Spee has really “rejected ” to save the survivors.
One of the aspects of this war is that no part seemed to be sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was holy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it's still the case at the end of the battle?
In the same way, the battle ended after the sun's sleep, made all more difficult safeguard operations.
Compare this with the next battle, the Malouine, where, on photos showing survivors in train of being saved, we see a quiet sea and full day.
Furthermore, the safeguards knew that there was no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, that doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading on this war, so I made a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion was ruled among German ships about two cooked cross, who had lost in the black after they had stopped the shoot and a cursuit started.
Leipzig saw something in fire, but when he came near, he lived that it was just a shoe.
The Nürnberg, less than the other German ships, joining the battle lately and see Monmouth, pitched and severely threatened but still moved.
Following its projectors on the ship pavilion, the proposal was refused and opened the fire, finally the ship.
Without faithful information, van Spee judges that the Good Hope had to escape and stop research at 22.15.
It is concerned about reports that indicate a British cooking in the areas, he sent to the north. ”
So if that is true, the Germans, in the darkness before the radiar invention, didn't know that one ship had been cut down, and so they couldn't look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important coward of the King Navy in the area that would have made them seriously endorsed, so in the confusion they were disturbing to benefit their advance.
They were far from their base, and Spee had well conscious that they should travel through many ships of the Kingdom Navy.
The victim of Cradock had already caused them to fail, and he had covered them around half of their munitions, condemned them so when they were finally taken.
Many votes are exalted to the UMP to ask that it is insert in the law and a finally condemned election or that is definitively inevitable.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the right left elections on.
But noon, it's a blague.
CETTE IDES AND PROPOSE OF THE INSCRIPATION OF THE MEDICAMENT OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the prohibition of syndicates in the already protected sectors?
How long will you take this equal distortion between citizens?
The vision of the society is limited by policies (s), which will always be able to enhance those who will benefit from their immobility to enter the actions of real policies, which are really trying to move things, not the beautiful talks which immobilism is in the measure of their sufficientness.
I met them in the metro to midday with their small pancarts" from under for justice" they came from province and didn't make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political syndicates, which members provide the great power that they depart from the service of its party.
She would not defend the same threats if the right syndicates, the right extreme, designed for the purposes of the persons of her border and were going to meet them a legal-mediate war.
Your statements are totally free.
If the right currently defrauds the current court is just that it has committed facts that are raised!
There are no examples of left personality that have done so much with the Justice but all those who have taken their attention did not have a favor treatment.
On the other hand, it is necessary to remember that the guidance syndicate that is left is not the only officer syndicate and that it is minority.
Let a Ministry support the syndicats with a lot of engagement show how they can be useful.
@MCR The syndicat you quote may be minor among the judges, but its influence is great in Chancellerie, it is not a secret.
We are then asked if the "mission" of certain judges is not more to go out instead of teaching.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What do you like?
@Pivoine: You forget that the officers are not officials as others: they are the only ones to have the power to make accusation and incarcer everybody.
Jade Goody?
What if no of the participants would never come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most dealer of glory is considered that X-Factor can only mean the end of a carrier, then I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many are served as tremplin to start a successful carrier.
The One Directors fill the towns of the whole world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or went to West End.
Popstars, the president of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, part of jurys.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the concourse of the Eurovision, as well as others.
While others, such as Frank Sinatra and all the rest participated in concurrences in the United States.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks have launched most of the lower divergence stars of the British TV.
Of course, some have fallen in the forget.
But this is what happens in any way in most stars who do not participate in competitors.
Weird they are those who, after a tube, succeed to do others.
Yet, most of the songs/groups can at best hope three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name, there's no fans just in the United Kingdom.
His celebration comes in part of his marriage with a footballer who respiras by the mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
can only mean the end of a carrier
In fact, it's more chance to move on a carrier than the typical rock path, even if you think in your dreams all the frimers to guitate who flew from herb in the garage of their father and balance three agreements on a primary school level will be sure stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even get out a album.
And worse than ridicule: it sets a complete artificial distance between the West Public and the student people – a distance that comes quickly to the racism, because sacratic ethnology presents us these farmers as infinitely superstitious and ritual bigotery petris, while most of their ways to do are strictly equal to our inspired, such as our, practical considerations to day.
Unless you interpret immediately inverse.
So, but instead of saying that the bubble is devoted by holy character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières have a little holy character?
Our bias is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumcised to the religious sphere.
The article is very interesting what it is.
It's the deco defemery to build the empty.
Nothing more.
Super article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of Illustrial figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred is always living.
Who still believes the archeological interpretations!
Any other discipline would lead to the orphans of interpretations, not of all scientists that are during the life of a mandatory, rarely less.
When is a compared criticism of disciplines for a bit of rigoration?
Because what is worth for archaeology is also for interpretations that give other disciplelines.
This would bring a dose of health modesy.
Your mistakes for archaeologists are actually unjusted!
It is grateful for them that it is constantly discovered by tresors, precious witnesses to reconstitute the history, understanding society, and the example of comparative archaeology is passive .
This method is not very old and the archaeologists were in their “instinct ” and their knowledge, and they could be threatened.
From our days, technical and scientific means are so performing that the interpretation of fools is better but can always be delivered by other discoverys!
It is full (and old) polyemic on the advanced callnism Jean Clottes (cf his book "The Challenges of the prehistorian," particularly the increased re-edit of the scientific controversy, compared to the editions The House of Roches).
Thank you for this strong instructive article
The helicopters love the anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put it out.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This journal is considered serious, done for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canvas?
No, but we're not against a teater party over there.
We couldn't see a musical comédia over there, that would be too gay!
We could wait to have this type of comment of your part.
It seems Mary Whitehouse's returned from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, I can suggest you to pass to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more home.
He prefers mykedow.
I could suggest that we were all looking for a journal that pays true journalists, courageous, to write them on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and losses.
Instead of ridicule with these puerill smokes.
Not very bad.
Let's go.
If these "pourly smells" are so shooting you, you are not obligated to participate, isn't it?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is actually possible to do both and publish a article on the anal sex?
Is that the subject you're shooting, or is it that people's riggling?
Nevertheless, we find the crash's amateur video on the net...
The tracking video on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images is only to protect its interests in any case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, she would have gone out safe because at the moment or another vehicle (e.g.) entered on the circuit.
But it had to be quick before the type that we knew he arrived, but for which the FOM has not judged the time of the department (right TV, pub, money...).
But on the other hand they're protecting the pilots.
I see, I also share this opinion.
But there is even if the very British FOM makes enter the SC, she will allow Nicko Rosberg to restart a chance to fight the English then...
You're leaving on this blog my beloved Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to destroy all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There were conspirations in F1, but there were never one who puts commissioners in danger of death for a lot story of a pilot's victory at the destruction of another.
It's not the FOM that goes out safe because it's the FIA.
It's a big dimension.
In view of Amateur images, the absence of images allows the FIA to escape the genetic issues of the type: How is the commissary acting a green track in full intervention and continue to do it after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it isn't because the video is too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because it is clearly seeing one of the commissors acting a green track, signs that the course can normally take and that it is more under yellow track regime.
Some comments show a serious misconnaissance of the F1.
Yes, honey Ethanne, the course is no longer under green track APRES the location of the accident, from where the Green Draft is acted.
It's the normal procedure.
The commissary position just on the bottom of the accident (as in cases, it may be at 10 meters as to 100 meters after the accident) acts the green to tell pilots to take a normal driving.
Sensionalism is sold from the pub.
Before I thought that the media were an integral part of the propagande of the government's patriotic propagande, but I'm very afraid that, at the end, it's just for money.
And the sex, don't forget sex, fear of not have sex, pub and media are good for us to sell things census to improve our sexual life.
Infos do exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information that we really don't need to be satisfied is just to continue to fear people to continue controling them.
“ When the tablets arise about Ebola, we all attract the fear, ” it should be “dealing, not“ all of them. ”
By means of the medical reference, “allusser ” is better to say in this context than“ discharge. ”
I ask if all the people who feel that Ebola could be able to propagate through a air path are considered that they now believe in the evolution?
You make them too honorable.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse that approaches.
Ebola is Antechrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and conscious article that requies pleasure and solidly this pseudo journalism abject.
That's good to fuck me.
It deems that the media speak about most of things with this optimism inside.
The goal is again to keep us sufficed and anguished (because to happen to historic) for the government can make us delay when he needs it.
I believe that it is perfectly logical that if we have to get a budgetary urgent in absence of all crisis, a terrorist urgency in absence of all attention, why don't we have an Ebola's crisis in the absence of any event?
He seems that this government seems to save us from the crisis he has invented himself.
Isn't there something based on problem with the idea of governing the fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world about 35 years later.
More than at the beginning, it had to be terrible, see the context of the 1980-90 years.
I'm bluffed, living with the sure of there for years .....
Perfectly inutile witness.
Like always when we talk about sciences.
Not only witnesses do not serve anything: taken isolally, they can't use scientific materials.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of facts.
@trafic: The witnesses can't use scientific materials.
Perhaps this is why we refuse to question patients in psychiatry when we have faithful observations in the neighborhood.
My psychiatric folder mentions that my mother explains that I have been trained telepatically by her beautiful mother.
So this is a target symptom.
When I say it's failure, it's a subjective witness without important.
Ah, because the warning of a fact (= this witness, who tests of pollution and effectiveness of new treatment) does not serve anything in a scientific approach?
What are you based on the research, then?
On the fantasies?
Do you put the same level of fantastic teories and facts (= giving place to checkable witnesses)?
“Resilience”: the word bidon adjusted by the grandmothers, J-L Delarue fans, which take for great psychology after reading D'ansemburg.
@Jim: There are plenty of buzzwords in the psychs.
Cyrulnik made us the “resistance. ”
As it's a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he'll cut us a loyal measure to quantify it, this famous resistance.
I ask if the Air Sentineles could all save us from Farage and Company?
Doesn't you think about Team America?
Seriously, it's not just a good idea to resort the air Sentineles...
And why?
It was a great series, and it seems that those who reserve it are conscious!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to all powerful who can do miracles.
But how are they going to do so that the kids grow up?
The only solution that comes to me to the spirit is the humor of pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It's already a series for children.
The kids were across.
Oh, because it's a series for children?
The UKIP works for Mysterons.
So keep your team American team.
Always in Supermarionation?
It's not like if we don't see the sons and that animation is done well. :-)
I'm quick to see this (which as adult), but I hope that it's gonna give the idea to a string of reducing the olders.
The series has almost never stopped to be divorced here in Australia; it makes at least 40 years that we have episodes from one hour at the Sunday and Sunday at 06h.
Since the free digital television has arrived a few years ago, it is on one of the trade strings of second order and we can always see it at these hours.
And in addition, the episodes of a half-hour pass out of time at 05:30, from lunch to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a "sound" man of 60 years, but I don't look at this series every day!
There's no "Mount of the temple" in or under the muscle of the sprangers!!!!
Radian missionists have invented this to give a political legislation to colonise Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israelian footballs below and around the mosque of the splanates since several decades have nothing allowed to find.
The mountain of the temple if there is existing is another.
Could it be in argentin?
This mountain is not searched for the simple reason that it is the colline on which the mosque exploitation has been built.
His room, or the rocher's drop, makes a smoke in the middle of Omar's muscle.
For the Muslims, Mahomet is gone to the Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is the Mount Moriah where Abraham was able to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since she has been taken and contextualized, there is no propagande, but information, looking for K1K1.
Israel also considers its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, this last plan had accepted it to 2 states, and he continued to take it away).
It is so good to show how the Jerusalem's annex is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his people?
The shortest of the Jewish blague: "God be praised!"
In order to prevent our tourism in Israel, we are often showing youths in half dressed, smoking on the ground.
The reality is, as usually, different from what we show publicity, as we can see it on the picture that explains the article.
It's a little scared at any time.
And this photo is a beautiful propagande!
Dommage that the photograph of Reuters didn't take the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Mount of the temple and that would prevent the Jewish faithful in contrabate, praying to the wall of lamentations.
@Mat, If this picture declines you, it's right, it's not the journal or the photograph, but this woman and ideal she's transmitting that he needs to condemn.
This system is not able and will end in clothes.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to go in the freedom, large enterprises have much benefit from their employees.
They succeeded to convince their salaries that they have the chance of have an employment and that they can not be allowed to increase the salaries, while in the same time and without hiding, they have always given the most important remunerations to the small election in the summit.
You're right, it's not tentable, but it's not gonna change in this country only when the workers will really speak of one voice.
Instead of rolling and ploting when someone else makes the green, support them, prove a little solidarity and understand that their green is not only their problems, but also shows your employee that people do not improperly.
Except if we leave the democracy, in what case, it's tenable.
I'm totally agreed.
The only thing you forgot is that the British and American businesses have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy that's got it.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The transatlantic trade and investment Party (PTCI) is to increase the benefits of the society held by these people in short circumcision of national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but it is exactly what it serves for the regulation mechanism of differences between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the Agreement.
The Greens are against this project and try to warn people about unimaginable disagreements that this agreement will be on our lives.
This is just recently beginning to talk in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is going to be negotiated in your dose.
Didn't Churchill say " blood, sugar, and lambs"?
That's what it makes good back, while the digital money doesn't have reason to fall and still be less to put on the trees.
The next low maillon will certainly be the car market.
This Mr was right, at XVIII there were syndicates in all rules.
In the very Catholic army, there is a sacrifice size.
Let it (finally, its officers, others, no one knows nothing) believe the forever values of France, and she will fight and shut his mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, shortly: the resolution of the Nation's idea, having this small religious, is comfortable.
Even if she's, it's more incomfortable...
They're still missing the syndicat with married men, cylibaters, married women, cylibaters, lost dogs and I don't know anything yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm syndicate.
You're predicted, that's your fault.
For the defence of category interests, there are already enough protection professions of syndicates, which have created an equation of equality with other citizens.
We are praying not to ride about the fear of the risk of a officer.
A system that ensures a certain freedom of expressions without syndicates, or then without gravity rights as in Germany, in contrast of the protection they play.
If you're safe.
And with the charlets that are prevented, the Government welcomes them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignore real...
I ignore Sybille ignorance, I made allusion to military and other officers, because this is the subject here commented...
We will remove "for the period of its delegated delegated" in Article 8 of the preambule of the constitution of 1946.
It will be: "8.
Any worker participates in the collective definition of work conditions and the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely indispensable with the disruption of the information power.
And however, you have opened, probably read and commented a particularly titled article “The Great British Bake Off Review”????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought he had to start the conversation.
It's Joffrey's marriage that I looked at, and I can tell you that some have been well murdered.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage, we have one of the best moments (quake trompeur: it was the wine) in the TV history.
That's what you're doing.
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time of reveal that, strangely, the emission ends with a victory of bulling at least the worst; nobody did a "boom, here's my fucking ship now buffle it and incline before your master!"
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally affected them?
Previous weeks, all these external persons were held out.
And there is also this idea of "playing security, always the next week" who lost the last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm infecting this.
I am grateful to those who do it and give us a great divergence and put us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last deficit of the last year, the marriage ship was absurd.
Professional workers generally set days to do them and they had to break up at 3 to 4 hours.
The three deficits were very difficult to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luz, the only real failure they could find it was the base of a little sequence (but if I am agreed with Hollywood to say that the green glass on the museum of Richard didn't live, in any way Richard had already lost this moment).
I have to advise that several deficits of this series seem to be a little artificial because of the expensive time.
There's also the cancer that winds, with the sun winds.
Decisively, all of us are successful at this time.
A bad moment to pass for humanity, we hope it.
You confund solar winds and ultraviolets.
The UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer that is just formed by the impact of residual solitaire and UV parts.
So even if the magnetic field was able, there would not be enough solemn wind to throw out the ozone of the stratospher.
There would be even more, and so less than UV and 'cancers'.
Happy that ozone layer doesn't lock the UV.
They have a useful task that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they're interested to allow us to have bones (Vitamine D synthèse), we're chauffering (infrastructures), moduling our immunity system and, like, to improve our moral.
The ozone layer locks the canceric UVC and allows the UVA and most UVB.
Do you know that you are not obligated to be condemned and consider your interlocutor as a permanent when you put a comment?
Especially for a small precision that was submitted in the comment, who himself hears to be proved of pedagogology.
Unless I'm a melanome habituate, the UV only makes ACCELER their development.
They're not PROVOQUENT.
For evidence: all bronzed persons do not have melanomes forced.
So, when a toubib tells you that you need to lose the sun and live in the ground of a cave, it is better not to listen because the UVs are needed for all humans.
The excess, in contrast, is like everything he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs provoke the melanome directly.
Can we get it up?
And, more important, can we go to the mixer?
or go to the mixer...
I believe that most of those who are interested have established that everything can be increased if we apply a sufficient force and the strength of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use to which it is targeted.
I think the army would have needed something more resident and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as the first-line communication material.
But for others,
That's a good choice.
the majority of those who are interested have established that everything can be raised if we apply a sufficient force
Except Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is he already raised?
We're doing this fraction in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
It's the fourth fraction on the layout I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, it is imagined that the phone has been removed from the main production string and it is bad to see how it could be returned.
So, uhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
The most probable is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and that is therefore consistent with the installed use code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But do they put test software on everybody?
The photographs on Ebay show clearly the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo by exceedingly.
We want little favorite products and we are surprised that industrial products produce in » industry' You're raised up above you but all teachers and subjects of the small trade are concerned How buffer good, bio abac 1650€ (medial sale in France)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After everybody is free to make its priorities where he hears it.
For my part, the food is one.
Get out of here, I'll put you up.
It is called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through a ideal "software" that brings them to disconnect realities.
It's the total degree of thinking.
They are experts in gestyculation, for example, suggesting to save the planet because they refused to take a dust.
They are also experts in the tartufery, with the left-caviar, which sometimes they are exhausted, for example, condemning CO2 rejects, even through their vacances to Maldives.
The greatest majority of our citizens does not support this medium of severe ideal and tarufery, too, is not surprised to meet often critics on them.
Waouh, thanks for this complete and exhaustive theory, as well as for all associated details (aeroplane, douche...).
I'd like to be party, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complex.
The boboeculars are monoplate.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And well you are in order to understand the concept of the boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just a ideal nune.
The classification would be more complicated if we interest in all short schools.
The boboecolo in fact, but it represents only the most visible fraction of the schools because it is the one who infects the media.
That's a beautiful girafe.
Look, nobody wants to look at this turn in face.
She's so bad that she seems vaguely like a noble female.
Chut, you're near the place.
It must be part of the art microscosm to understand the stupefactory of the truth of this work.
But you just have no legality to make a comment because you haven't past innumerable decades to study and flatter great artists.
The matter is not the fact that Emin does not know drawing and seems always obtained by the same subject.
The matter is that she has really succeeded to become fabulously rich and honourable in having no artistic capacity.
That's the art.
No, it's a cock.
The fact that Emin doesn't know drawing
That's the one who isn't really an accident.
It is more than a opinion.
Except if the only thing you could appreciate is realists of dogs flying in playing a billard.
Judging the art may be difficult, but not in this case.
Drawing, it's more than just representing the reality.
If you don't look for this, a photo device will do the business.
The author also talks about the expressions of Emin.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the type of design that you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is yet something to do: equitation activities, number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals that are not active...
L(honesty) is obvious to say that France decreases its efficiency, but as all countries have done it, sometimes more drastically, beginning by the United Kingdom.
It's just half encouragement...
The operator without support, it's quickly found his limits!
A single approach, at the time we observe the weaknesses, the insufficientness of our defence tool, in particular in Sahel.
A bad cause for local collections concerned, which lose a size of their activities, see a part of their history.
Where's the promise?
@edmond: That's exactly what I said, look out elsewhere to make economys but especially not in my house, it's not really possible...
That's exactly what you're proposed to do, look forward where the gabegie is sure.
Let all those who have cooted the military thing come here, the eyes in the eyes that there's no money played in this period, and that's without crying...
To apply the same position to the whole public function and public financials will be a little better.
And for Josi: Very excited: look at the inflation of public employments in the other ministry and you will understand why the Defence may be a little loaded!
Well, yeah, the economys on which everyone agrees to say that he needs to do them, though it's going to see somewhere, isn't it?
There's no poor poor, those on which it falls to the murder when it happens to them, the poor dears.
It should be done, but especially that it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and an economy.
Guignols, go!
What will the Valle of Grace make our defense tool in Sahel?
With regard to local collections, the story is repeated to every post closement, maternity, hospital, cash.
But everybody's for good economys.
It is amazing, a UMP master who wants compensations and does not rejoice the economys made in the public expenditure.
This article is really the worst thing I've never read!
This is the moment that the three first persons who comment the same bad failure.
It's the depression to make his Facebook son disappointment and see that 80% of his friends have started their states by the word "This amazing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
He will certainly be based on hilarant scenes where someone falls by haard on his ex in the bus to go to the work and only counts that his egg is back into his culotte.
It's not amazing, it's completely with.
Not really, after me, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who we have always learned to smoke his emotions and to smoke the dents.
I'm sure if you are a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return on the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you know that your comment is now in the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have "Internet".
So I don't think I can't comment.
There's no computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before he died!
I can't believe what this article is the most incredible thing I've never read!
Charlie really comes to show that he's all over the cosmic universe that is the satiary journalist!
I'm falling on the back!
I have absolutely needed to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illillillance and find the unbelievable fulfillment and the insufficient genius that cut off the keyboard of Mr. Brooker as a godly light.
Oh, my God, it was really no.
Especially if it's not women or travestists.
I'm a parasit.
This shows positive development in the democracies: amount of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Before the new order, we make the right to save our planet by States who play the targets at each meeting to save the planet.
So we decide, citizens, to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they have planned for energy, all these beautiful recommendations have been affected ....
Translation: Eoliennes and Solitaire clusters are the Rond points tomorrow.
The entire funded by the consignable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear conversation.
The pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radio activity is much more negative at the level of its decades and in case of accident.
While the philosopher is not dominated in its integrity, it is better to limit the laboratory.
Renewable energys are our only health, as well as we hear drasticly reduced our consumption.
The electricity by the renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France is nothing concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emission to production and epsilon for other steps.
The electricity by the renewable eolian or PV is already more than the EES on other steps and especially the gas, or worse carbon as in Germany, to compensate the intermittency.
Replace the nuclear by the renewable oil or PV would go to the confrontation of the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insulte you I'm a doctor of State in physical sciences in 1981 more I've made research in nuclear physical physical physics I put you on the deficit of testing the contrary of what I said.
For what I didn't say is you to give me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany, in fact, you didn't answer what I said and as all the right people to demoly the interpreter I never do.
In addition, I consider the conclusion of experts sent by the German government: the current Germany's renewable energy programme is an ineffective and ineffective way to reduce the EES emissions and should be arrested.
0 emissions if you don't account the extraction of urinium and the construction and if you don't count the water vapour of gas in fact of serry effect that the Co2 is really reminded of the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear central part in water vapour and a little in the river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "German of South Asia"...!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised, most Indians who put comments do not want to read and make comments only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it shows your spirit status.
It would be like if they had qualified the Indian Gentle of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistan players participate, but have a Pakistan version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a Pandor's full corruption and mafiosis box.
With regard to the ISL, today's opening match has been very interesting, Kolkata's Athletic is 3-0 against Mumbai.
The Pakistan has a lot of way to do.
In comparison of billions and billions that India consists to the IPL cricket and now to the football, how we can raise a day with our "bruying neighbors"...
The course to the low cost is paying cash.
Dommage for a so beautiful project.
For the incidence, the eventually conceptual failure is only shown with a very frog helium.
Perhaps we're not in a conception failure, but in implementation...
In contrast to the airspace that is a private society, it seems to be zoouz in the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own security.
They can pay the satellites in fregate who knows..
This is now more easier than many media repeated on the only titles of articles - and that many readers reach only these titles .
In general, it creates a false impression against the contents of the article itself.
In fact, in accordance with you, the title is not appropriate, he makes it unjustly due to the project while it is only a launcher's problem.
