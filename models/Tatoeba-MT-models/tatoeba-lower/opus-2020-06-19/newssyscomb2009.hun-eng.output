Working people in Austria, they have 29 per cent
The earlier majority of two parts and the right-old population parts have brought a significant strength on the first previous results of the Australian Parliament's elections on Monday.
In Austrian Nepart (OVP), where the current president was truly attached to Wilhelm Molter, especially a strong loss.
In this regard, President of the Assembly for the future of Austria (BZÖ), President of Karinthia, Jörg Haider, is prepared for a victorious return to the national policy.
On the basis of the previous results, the country remains more stronger in the Social Democratic Part (SPE) with 29,8 per cent of votes, however, the votes have lost 5,5 per cent of votes for the last 2006 elections.
The EVP was more worse than 25,6% of the votes, which loss the nearly nine percent of the votes.
These two large parts have been the most worst results in the Australian war history, and, in addition, the results are catastrophical in Nepart’s previous elections.
At the beginning of July, the EVP coalition was a significant advantage of the people park before the SPÖ.
However, the electors were able to be disappointed because they had left the government to go.
In the first reactions given to the results, speculations have already been voted on the possibility of the participants Wilhelm Molter and the current incident.
The officers think that it may be a weekly row in the party's apartment.
This development would probably be easy to facilitate the most probable rate of the election results, as well as the SPÖ and EVP biggest coalition.
With a view to ensure that a part of the two rights population, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), the 18% of the votes and the BZO, and the 11 percent of the votes, were also afraid of the social democratics, in the same time, to the review of the 1999-1999, when the community government was established in the public government (FZO was still one of the peoples (in the time of 2005, the BZZ), which was also previously submitted to the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he's ready to cooperate with any party, and I'm supposed to return to the national policy, clearly interested in this solution.
The Green Party came to the Parliament, however, from some of the lost population, and between the political parts of the islands from the third place returned to the fifth.
One of the other parts did not step over the four hundred limits and didn't come to the Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Choosing Indian connections
If you would not succeed to resolve the problem of cheque scientists mentioned for the unlawful collection, Karel Schwarzenberg Chah's Ministry may have a certain decrease in the chehical relationships.
The Ministry published this today after the meeting with Pranab Mukherdz, the Indian partner in New York.
"If it's not going to resolve it, then, yes, there would be a certain decrease," she established after the meeting, whose training has come from.
After the negotiation, he said that the executive power could be difficult to income in judicial cases.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Swacha, who has been saved and punished by violence, the Central Government may be undertaken with the local leadership that the case is required for the law.
"It's her problem could be resolved," said the Ministry.
The three years of prison, Emil Kucze, however, says Mukherdz, would be the best that he would be in the highest court.
Then, in the contradiction of a liberal position, he explained freely to the court.
Schwarzenberg justified that his partner was likely made out in the negotiation.
"He recommended the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to save him," said the Chief Diplomation.
The only way you can income to the whole case of the Cheche party, the "competent law support" sent to the Indian Ministry.
She said that Indian fear has already ensuring them such a help.
"We're most interested in India to maintain the best relations with many years of age.
The Indians also recognize this," says Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as the CTK said, his partners voted that the Czech Republic properly properly properly for the problems of the Cheche enthomologists.
"We have a very severe conscience of these chicken scientists to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be attached."
At the question, whether the Indian half has received a vote to employee the Agency, the Ministry has expired the answer.
"But I got a lot of promises," she said.
Czech courts continued to fight for the seafuncture
Get out of the valley electronic map where Australia and the neighborhood sea areas are visible.
But it's not interesting the earthquake, but one of the lost points in the ocean blue.
"The island is the Australian island, and with him is the neighborhood of the sea.
In the area, as you are the continent," says Luigi Santosuosso Italian law, which is in the ENSZ Division Sea and Sea Affairs.
Your Boss, Vaclav Mikulka's law, the Division Manager, take care of the explanation of sometimes.
It's a monkey and anxiety rules here.
In natural resources of the sea, it is rich, that has been known as the world.
It is possible here to be stones, hair and other gas materials, but even known living organisms, such as the key of the development of medicines against the rabbits.
More sea ground than the ground
In our days, the party is intendable for new areas under the sea.
According to the ENSZ Agreement, the same rights are approved from which the Montgo Bay was established in 1982.
First, it is about the area of the continent plan, which often goes from the parts of the country given to a few hundreds of kilometres.
According to the agreement, it has the only right to all sources of the continent fund.
"It is easy to make a continent basis for the part of the sea inside and under the white map, which is naturally proceeding under the sea.
The part is over to the sea borders, often two hundreds of the sea mills of southern southern southern, just the front of the Economic Area,” states Mikulka.
The request in which the country is presented to the Commission selected external limits of the Continent basis should be completed with a number of customs research and extensive scientific technical documents.
This is the result of many years of pre-progress work.
"Our task is a legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has discussed five requests, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have gone through success," makes it Mikulka.
In the recent world, Australia has successful, which first increased the country under the sea.
But the New Zealand is also opened - the field of the maritime area for the Commission sent to be about 1,6 million, or six times greater in the country area.
In the investigation, two countries were more than million dollars.
The use of the future of the sea is increasingly increasingly increasingly.
In other countries, other countries will continue to review their requests.
This can be done in ten years since the ratification of the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continent plan is finished, the field of the ocean area published by the Agreement is opened by the "Common Health of the Humanity".
There's no simple situation for one country.
The law of exemption shall provide the international institution established by the Agreement.
"It's not Klondike, but it's not Klondike," says the leader of Mikulka, "the same areas have been clearly obtained and restricted in the Treaty."
Shut up on the Czend Ocean
The sealand is part of the Management of the Czech Republic.
This east block is divided with other countries in the framework of the Common Interocean Organization.
On the basis of the agreement, in 1991, some other countries have received the state of the "investment investment" state.
It was authorised to produce Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the ClarionClipperton area in the Cendes Ocean.
The investing area is more larger than the Czech Slovakia.
The seafuncture has arrived there. It's a copy of the Tata's under the sea.
"This range of 75,000 square miles can be exposed.
The rich polymetic feelings containing nick, skin, cobalt, and mananna's polymetic feelings," states another law, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, his division worker, shows another specific example.
A burgh, or a little fantasy, remembered the pergamen of Golèt's pergamen with a little fancy.
German special forces were present for the freedom
The Egyptian Government requested a help from Germany to resolve the sustainability, and the officers came.
When the situation changed seriously, the special units were ready, however, they were not income.
The liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt will be more detailed to the day.
In the relief action, the Ministry and the Ministry of the Office were also participated in Germany special forces, according to the data of the Office and the Office.
Except the German Hadserge Hadseller's aeroplane of GSG 9, the German Court of Justice, and the Federal Criminal Office of Works and the German Musical Services were also logistical experts in the area of delivering.
According to the last week of the Ministerial Districts, German forces were not required, however, because the travellers were allowed to run their prisoners, and then they went away when they recognized the signs of the powerful reserve.
The Egyptian Government accepted aid by Germany, therefore, accepted to ensure as a powerful supporter.
"It wasn't for happy," she declared the officer of the Ministry of the Court.
The taxers were broken from five Germans, five of Italian, a Roman woman, and eight Egyptian experiments in the southern part of Egypt in September 19.
Following a human railway in the southern Egyptian area, the ships of Egypt, Libya, Sudán and Chad were cut down here.
The exception of the travellers remained unclean, just as the details of the delivery of the ships or the appropriate change payments.
In the age of time, Cairoba came in the building.
Steinmeier told me that the released ships were under the protection of German followers.
The freedom's details were not published.
In Berlin, there were no information about when they return to Germany.
According to the "Image" day, five tourists and special forces are welcome to the German Legi Haders Airbus machine.
The United States Photoshop rejects the chamber.
With a small majority of the U.S. Congress underways, 700 billion dollars were proposed for financial markets.
And Dow Jones's worse.
The United States Representative House 227 did not vote against 206 to the Government's passenger group for financial markets.
George W. Bush, President of the United States and the two parts of the politicians have not received a majority of the program, with which they wanted to achieve the financial markets.
The supporters were tried to review the need for 700 billion dollars during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, a democratic party called to support the representatives, even if the plan is still invisible.
"It's hard to get a political support to avoid something that hasn't been followed."
Dow Jones was still under the vote more than 6% and 600 points.
The purchasers were concerned that the State shipping group would be the same.
The index subsequently mentioned before the conclusion of the vote, that it would be replaced after the publication of the cooking.
Experts are considered more severe turbulencies in international financial markets.
The programme is required to ensure that the Conference House and the Adoption of the Secretary-General should be approved.
The lawyers are registered more business.
It promises to German traveling systems.
According to a study, the training of the next months was significantly raised to the previous year — more than 30 percent of the television sezon.
In contrast of conventional views, German traveling was not cut down according to the study.
The traveling offices have received 31 per cent increase in the past year - known in Berlin in the German Utah Covenant (DRV).
According to the GfK marketing institution, the number of previous months is also higher.
In October 11 per cent of travel offices, the DRV was transmitted in October 2007.
These results are based on GfK data, which estimates the 1200 German traveling office and extrapolates the full market.
The institution has taken into account travels taken until the end of August 2008.
The DRV had been carried out, especially because of my donor currency, especially the travelways in the United States.
This is one third of its investments.
In particular, Germany's favorite road objectives established Spain, Turkey and Greece, and home taxes.
In addition to the organizated routes, Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
For the current energy and food costs in the case of the organized roads, the costs are "increasingly calculated for travels as to the individual organized travels."
In the case of the travels, there may be a payment of money, or all inclusive offers - she made Laepple to her.
It was very good for the late months, so it would be possible to promote a growth to the past year, even though, according to another study, it was less to the German company in the past year.
The first October
Ballerman lyrics, literal lyrics, and damned news.
Development in Wessen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I have not many similar to each other.
He's a smoke, a television manager, and he's a lot of smoking wine.
My hair's dark, I'm a dick, and I took my clothes in the train.
However, one thing has been connected to us: we are at the Weasne along three minutes, we have already broken our photographs and fill their memory cards - very famous, and all of my first visit in Weissen.
That's what we can do for friends.
It seems that the smoke is doing the planning.
From the white colbs, the white colobs has been raised to the north of the Wiesn tourist, my compulsory is still limited to the people's community.
But when you arrived to Theresienwis, it's not so bad.
Almost everybody takes a threat or a scarlet; no one looks in a striking or awful - it's all right.
It's amazing moments at the cycosiban stage, just my worst bond.
A munchian woman calls my attention that I'm wrong with the living, "Balra's free, you're driving down, you're on the right hand, you're a widow."
In my secret, I've moved the mass on the left.
"That's good," he says, and his name.
Others have a smaller tracking around the nice flatch techniques, and they're going to get a simple kitchen, "I'm too nice to kill me," and they're not requested to show their field backs.
The young man named Bob's exhibitionist exhibitionist, and also the first visited in the Oktoberfestre.
What's very amazing to find is the aaaaaa long.
After all, he told me that he was free from the content of his cut in the past.
Just at one of the fires that looks like everybody's eyes.
So Bob's one of the news of "the leaders in a lot."
Others are not so happy to save alcohol in such ways.
Tonight, eight hours, the travelers walk in the army until the location and take care of the poor parks.
The patients always appear in the team — once four cicles in the tent of the tent to a pitcher.
This works as the most of the Wesn trainer: the valuation is empty, the training is cut off.
Whoever steals in the alcohol based on the ponyba, it doesn't seem.
"These who are perfectly ready," he cried to me one of my challenges and then in the market.
The police named the fat victim.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who hit a vehicle in Essex and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood's famous residence of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, had the challenge in Shenfield Roadon in the city.
The Romford Queen's hospital was sent to the hospital, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51 - year - old man was arrested with an unexpected guidance.
They've been released since they've been watched.
Turkish Diplomacy Horizon
Before Turkey had been attached to the European Union, Europe's powers were heavenly from the desire to deeply attach to the Turkey.
On the east side of Bosporos, maybe 20 steps from the European border, is one of the most important national currency.
The Hydarpasha bathroom built two Germans, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu planned in neorensean style.
At least the travel arms are writeing this.
The building turns around the end of the perons, one toron to all the other strangers, and looks like something in German cities.
The stone's cool.
The whole building's a little bit.
Nevertheless, in particular, the front of the bold office of the office of the field, the biggest company was the best door.
The state of German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation opened in August 1908.
Germany, the "common future" of this Damaica Bagdadon, is requested to ensure its efforts to promote the future of the Neighbourhood-Arabia today.
During the I World War, German changes were joined.
The Arabic Lawrence and the Arab party party were supported.
Department of the environmental regions, which have been disappeared by the frontiers of the Clean War, has lost.
The British Army went out from Egypt, and decreed the rulers and German covenants from Palestinian and Siria.
Hyderpasha's station hasn't gone better.
In 1917 he broke a shooter and destroyed the building's best worked team.
According to the resources, sabotage action happened.
Since it was late, and it's fine over my story.
In the same time, today, as the gate of the ship of Anatólia and the entire east region - at least the symbolic understanding - Turkey’s exposed diplomatic horizon.
The Party of Justice and Government in the Government - the ACP - has worked a full new external policy for the country.
Department of the environmental regions, which have been disappeared by the frontiers of the Clean War, has lost.
The new policy refers to the procedure.
It was noted that the law Government had a good relationship with Israel and Syria, Hamas and Fatah's Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran, and, naturally, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to meet the parameters of the new external policy, so I went up to the head of the Court in Ankara to see the ACP's foreign policy expert, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, after ten and half hours of darkness, he gave a new new document film about the old world, the ritmus of the Night Mail, - I came to the head of the Turkish. The new city is the new world's symbol that turned back to the house.
However, the ACP's paradigmation of the ACP's consensus of the race.
It's been a range in the west, especially in Washington.
I went to the AKP room, an ultra-modern, stone, and a rock, and a rock, telling to the building prepared for this target, which is in a developing foreign quarter, hotly prepared income centres and coffeees.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have introduced a better central policy in any other European countries.
I'm sure there was a Blackberry's even with him.
"The party's foreign policy objectives to help Turkey's renewable introduction in direct environment.
The Hidden War has broken the rule," he said.
Turkey's separated background.
He had to turn the east and the west once once.
He couldn't choose one of the two.
He had to open both in the direction.
"But it's possible that you're going to be a choice before?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to answer."
Afterward, it sounded that at least all I spoke here, and again: Turkey is not only with the Neighbourhood, but also the relationships with the Caucas and the Black Sea are serving to Europe and the United States as to Turkey.
As if you want to direct the message that - in the meaning of Turkey - with Turkey, all Europe can go on to the south of Asia and the Neighbourhood.
When I was on the Hydarpasha Station, I thought about the two German men who had been carried out for this entire building for 100 years ago.
It would be wonderful if they know that Europe's nearest emotions are now in Turkey's hands.
And as I was waiting for the board to get back to Bosporus, I came to call Turkey in the time of the European Possible Man.
At least there was no question for which landscape would be promised to this merciful country.
Remember life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: Since 1962, Guildford's music leader, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nerologue, sect. 11).
On the basis of the musical plans for the citizens, Proteus was based on a wonderful young sickness in the next year.
In 1979, many of us have already walked at the end of the 20 years - we were just not to be able to change the sickness.
The name of "Proteus" (methological change name) was in accordance with the distinction and capacity of the hospital to cut out with any coffee that they do before - to be madrigue, or a Messiah, without an experiment, or a larger disease.
A young man’s popularity of such a curious music was often smoking, and we could thank the man who was inspired to the music that our soul was increasingly changed in the years.
How often Todd told us to "lay his music out of you."
He always said, "The musician knows what he wants.
It's all in the coffee.
So sing a song!"
Carmester's technology was always fully understandable and exactly, but never diktatorical, or overwhelmed.
Everyone was with the music color, he always put it on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about this:
If you ever lived as a man who had to fight the horse, Vernon Handley was.
I was well known in the two-year-year-old, which, from 1962 to 1982 Guildford's Philharmonics.
In the past 40 years, I wrote the criticism of more than 100 concerts, but never, no eggy, and often involved with them.
Todd Handley was together with the biggest and the assurance that's very ridiculous.
He hated the leaders who lived with his words -- just "the two of the well known challenges were galoped until the end of the world."
You'll miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
According to your William Woodruff, September 25, "In 1946 he continued to study economic research in Oxford, and in 1950 the Houble-Norman Research Institute was designed... while the fundamental diploma, the Master diploma and the PhD address was continued to be prepared."
This is Woodruff from the manufacturers of the "Beyond Nab End" address, but heavy.
Between 1946 and 1953, the Newtinghami University's Economic Affairs and, in addition, J. D. Chambers, the PhD disarmament was completed from the British Gumiipar, which was then given in 1958 to the address "The British Gumiipar".
In 1950 to 51, he was held in the United States with a Houble-Norman restaurant, and in 1952, on the Ilnois, New York and Harvard university.
Finally, in 1953, he left Nottingham and Illinois.
You can't know why Woodruff has built this time.

Second records to London
In November, Honda begins the second generation of Jazz.
Yes, it was too big enough for the travel, but the new model's internal area was still more efficient.
Everything is compared with the mechanism that makes the leading and increases the exploitation.
Evolution results of revolution.
That looks like the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although it was very similar in the new Jazz view, many internal changes have ended on it.
These are, for example, the innovative disease, the new army, the largest sizes and the new mechanism.
But before we turn to the detailed recognition of the new model, we need to say that the new Jazz has been signed six years after the first generation market.
So, first we can be able to prevent that Honda's shorter time has been able to get this model than for other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz was a lot of known, but it decided to sell records on other markets.
Such markets, for example, Japan, where in 2002, and then, in 2008, Jazz was the best car car.
For example, from the marketing of Japan, about 1 million rates were given from Jazz.
The second market was an old continent, about half million years ago.
However, Honda wants to grow more in the area with the new Jazz.
Thus, while the Japan's total 83,000 Jazz has been distributed in 2007, the investment seems to be $100,000 cars for 2009, that the growth of 17% would result in the European market.
Since the Spanish market, Honda has been estimated by 8,000 of Jazzt since 2002, Honda has 6,7 per cent of the total Spain reduction.
For the new generation, the managers of the Spanish girl company are calculated by an example sold under 2000 under a year disruption.
In addition, the new Jazz arrives in greater rate to reduce the return of the Honda Spain.
The representatives of the company shall apply the same example of 22,000 sold until the end of this year, which is less than 4000 data in 2007, thus 16% reduction.
In contrast to the price conditions, Honda increased Spain market participation with 1,6% to 1,8%.
In 2010, I just want to grow in the same area, to 2%.
According to Honda hopes, this may be the introduction of a new model.
This would be the Insight, a compact and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which Japan’s companies would take 200,000 dollars in the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the insight market shared the United States until the number of the continents spent between the Old Continens and Japan.
Insight trade industry after the official currencies planned for January, it is in its first months of the year.
First generation, the new Jazz has become more detailed from all the points.
The length of 3900 mm (5 cents longer), the width of 1690 mm (and two cents larger) and the water distance increased five cents, 2500 mm.
His height is increasing 1520 mm.
Besides the sizes, the straight ground has also been cutting.
The biggest inner area is the new armory, otherwise the investment container in the middle of the middle - we can already know this solution from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, it grows up to the full rate of a double pattern, which is currently 399 liter, which continues to be the first generation capacity of 19 liters.
Although the above sizes are included in the type of 1,4 engine, the same is the 1,2 Honda Jazz composer 379 letters.
Some external changes can also be developed, for example, back-border lamps or the selectable panorama and the easier accessibility of back-up seats.
Furthermore, the opening of the doors for behind meetings were added to 80 steps, in contrast to the first opening of Jazz 67 steps.
The second generation engines are also new.
In the beginning, this small model can be used with two, 1,2 and 1,4 liter shipping.
The use of both resources in the previous model, as well as smaller sandoxide emissions and excessive mechanical compatibility, the engine is also achieved in all areas.
The completion of 1,2 literal resources is 90-year-old 6000, and the maximum printing is 114 Nm 4900.
This engine - which was 78 steel in the previous Jazz - 5,3 liter consumption and 125 grams of CO2.
And the other engine, which produced 83 carriers from the previous generation, is now achieved by 100 lowers.
The 100-year-old, 1-4-Jazz's transparency requires 5,4 liters, and its emission is 128 grams CO2.
The "motor" of the confrontation
In order to develop baleset technology with Nissan from nature, exactly the imagination from the world of the skins to a new finding.
The Japanese company planned a robot that follows the smoke of the balls.
Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step for the development of technologies in the context.
In collaboration with the Scientific and Technological Research Centre of Nissan Motor Co. Fejlett, this small robot was built in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, the Technological PR and Research Research Market Manager, says that BR23C is the further extension of Nisan's 4-year security market.
The robot makes the capacity of confronting their products.
In the airport, every meal is raised up your oil personal area, which is very similar to the Nissan Security Bank.
However, it is more important to the skin's eye covered in all directions, whereas it sees more than 300 steps in each direction. In the following way, the smoke can be flewless in its own personal area.
In order to copy the entire eye function, the migrants planned a laser range (Laser Range Finder).
The manufacturer identifies the academies, calculates their distances, and sends a sign to the federal microprocessor, which is currently operating on the basis of the operation for the disagreement.
"As it happens, the small robot changes immediately after the movement of the rocks in smaller or larger angles in the movement of fighting.
The system is less distinguished from the available arts that in this case the manufacturer will be completely automatically carried out.
If not so, the robot couldn't react enough quickly to react to the accommodations," - says Toshiyuki Andoh, the Mobilitatic Laboratory manager and the project officers.
In separate ways from the skins, the railway manner cannot be directed up or bottom, and not transparently, he can only move in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotativeness, or in an infinite direction and way as it happens in the case of the skins.
That is why Nissan also used a rotation function outside the rating and delay in the robots.
"All of this structure needs to work for a few seconds and react to them.
It is not necessary to store data or to logical logic based on previous manufacturers, so it can only work with some of the KB memories without interruption.
Maybe this sounds surprised, but it's not really gigabyte, but we're not talking about a big memory yet.
This is the first step for the development of the technical service of avoidation, which, based on Nissan's estimations, can be entered within ten years in the cars of sero-free transport.
The robot litium-polimer assumulators are easier and maintained than the change of litium-ion.
In the future, there may be further application opportunity to build the unit with the GPS manufacturer navigation system to bring the car to the end with the performance of the incidents on the road.
I'm afraid of the report
We need to recognize that the United States Ministry Institute is too much investable, and they have noticed.
Since the crisis has been a conflict and that the Americans don't have to carry out in the resources of paying capacity, they have created a brown and informatic network game in the Bad Credit Hotel.
This is the "Ross trust hotel" or the galiba.
The reception and, in particular, the reception buscomore is suggested, let's think again, two times, at least three times, actually, if the time of the credit record is now come.
And especially where we need faith, because it's probably the goal.
It's really useful, but less detailed.
It's more than the grandfathers.
But what would happen if we could finish the game?
For example, the room of dreams will be shown in the hotel.
Well, it's something, because we don't have to dream about the apartment.
Morgan Stanley opens his head for MUFG
Morgan Stanley reported that in the capital of the Midsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japan's bank of 9 billion dollars for 21% of the undertaking head, after the cost of Morgan Stanley has increased in the board.
One week after the previous agreement, two banks said that MUFG was sold by 9,9 per cent of the Morgan Stanley officers to $25,25 for $3 billion.
The currency accepted remains more than 19% of the value of the book on 31 August.
MUFG increases more than 6 billion dollars to the purchase of valuable papers which are insured by 10% of the funds, and the transitional costs are 31,25 dollars.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on the average cost of 29 dollars, which is higher than 28% of the current market.
However, Morgan Stanley's party process, according to the Greenwich media, returned to 6,79%, and it was locked in $23,07.
"This strategic cohesion has a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to quickly translation of the bankholding company," explains John Mack, the American company manager.
Morgan Stanley left the last week the new statement that can differences its activities, even though the Federal Reserve is under control.
The MUFG agreement reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires greater attention from the companies mentioned in Wall Street.
From the conditions mentioned in the week, the agreement has been changed in the last days: Morgan only indicated that about 20% of its participants would give $8,5 billion for Japan's enterprise.
"Then weeks ago, we thought that the participation will stand out of the entire trials," explained Toshide Mizuno, the MUFG manager in Tokio.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we would like to minimize and protect possible risks."
The severe average of the MUFG is more than 7% in the book for Morgan Stanley.
In the conclusion of the transaction, I'll be reduced to a party at about 20%.

Letters - Culture "Merge"
In the center of the newspapers and the actual election campaign, the current life is related to the financing of culture.
We can just be happy.
But our cultural life will continue to forget a spirit.
Who will repeat the voice to explanate the numbers of small museums, writers, ancient events and national history memorys?
What political marine is to remember the Covenant Government that it does not take care of the structures of the cultural heritage?
Or do they not take any laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government was translated to the restauration of the Chinon in the Loire street only for three and half million euros?
And the Institute of our American citizens says that cultural heritage is a part of the American culture, and it must be protected in accordance with all national citizens, representatives of all selected representatives and government authorities.
The Quebec Treaty (Federation of the company d'historium du Quebec), in the framework of 211 history, with cultural heritage, exploitation and genealogy society, is more than 40 000 alone in the study of the history, as well as the maintenance of the largest arcade and archaeological detail.
These organizations are immediately protecting our heritage with a weakness, and the last force of the smoking, when the developers and decisions are directed to our old buildings and forgotten tents.
When will anybody call for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
A part of the Fortis bank of Benelux governments
The Benelux states help the American credibility crisis, as the first European, in Belgium Bank, Fortison: the three countries support the financial and security institutions of the United Kingdom with 11,2 billion euros.
The Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are the highest level of the case at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission.
Fortis bank in the Euro-government is the first great crisis in the clusters in the framework of more than a year-in-country international financial crisis, therefore the decisions taken in the case of the bank may be precededed from certain points.
In accordance with the decision born on the Sunday night, all three nearby states (in 49%) shall be raised in the bank's owner.
The bank sells a part of its interests, which has been insured by the Netherlands of ABN Amro, in particular, the security activities.
Fortis participants started to steal the past week, and at the second of the seven were already shown serious circumstances to the institution.
However, the representatives agree that with the 85,000 major employment of the bank is too big to allow you to go to the ground.
The companie's papers were cut down in a total of 12 percent, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the parties was reduced more than two thirds.
The current parties are included in the full market capital of the group around 14 billion euros, but, according to the companies, it is not real.
In other cases, the company has obtained non-profits of the sea market related to accepting 700 billion dollars of the American equipment.
The papers have already been a lot in the week.
In the Peninsula Philippi Dierckx, the new manager called the bank lives.
Financial institution has also been looking for self-controllers, but no one has been mentioned by an interesting proposal.
The Belgian government has already stated that the investors have no need to be disappointed, they will not lose their money.
The bank customers haven't seen a panic, the boys haven't been disappointed.
In Hungary, the Fortis's own sons, and he also covered the shipping.
Rook and tick
In America, life- and health security assessments are often approved to ensure a contract with the reporter.
Data protection officers are concerned that the data must be uncontrolled by the market.
"It is a data protection program that involves the use of medicine data in any case to contribute to the person concerned.
This should be independently, except we trust the stick" Richard Dick, the developer of the program to follow the medicine records in Washington Post.
Security companies are dependent on the health stage of the employer’s assessment costs and risks, and if the risk is too large, they do not have any assurance.
Recent medical tests were sent to the patient and the Treaty was linked only to the knowledge of the test result.
Dick has found a longer process: from medicines, based on the customer's identification number, easily makes the medicine whose medicine has been buyed in the past half years, and this program decides how he has suffered and how healed.
For example, if you usually take a high-cool dose reduction, it is the way to use an immediately high level of blood, which is increasingly higher risk category.
The program also has more changes, some also define the risk number, so the securityer remains permanently outside our paper, although small difficulties are taken.
In the areas, some medicines may also be used for more objectives, such as some collections can be used in migration or helicopters, but also effects against depression.
The latest assessment factors of significant risk growth are not previously.
For the data processing and processing, individual companies have been developed, and they have requested the advantage of the needed information from the medicines.
This is now connected to the authorities, although they have not been punished for their permanent destruction.
Certain companies are also working on the results of the laboratory studies, together with the medicine processing data, so they can still serve a higher picture of the patients’ health situation.
More companies have been added to the data and the use checking of this will be more difficult.
There is special health safety law, but the effect is only for health services and security services.
There is a law proposal before the Congress, which also provides control rights on the data services.
Dick Richard says that it's not enough: so he continued to develop the program that would offer the data transfer to the relevant contribution.
Another question that the concerned may deny the contribution, otherwise, the guaranteers do not agree with it.
So, then, all the balls are able to be worthy of the rock.
Global Marseille plan
Duplicates the trade of the European Union and India
While the European Union and India, in particular trade partners, the fifty-centrating period has also ruled this theme at the end of the global problem.
This is also a French Indian smoke, where the atom-energy cooperation will be mainly.
The European Union recognizes that India is an excessive democratic greater capacity that should give greater inquiry in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to achieve the common name of the new membership in the Security Council of the ENS.

In this context, the legal understanding of the twenty citizen aviation agreement referred to in India may be comprehensive, as well as the aircraft can be achieved in the future.
You want to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised that they're going to quickly.

Afghanistan and Pakistan's situation, or the terrorism, were sent in all of its forms, and the ENSZ conference was interrupted.
The end of the Dohai trade transfusion was also encouraging, although both of them have a large part in the age.
The EU has confirmed that its energy and climate program was made in place, as well as you want to reduce at least 20 per cent to 2020.
The India has also agreed, even if the future climate conference should be attached to global principles, and the production of gases that are exceedingly gased by 50% to 2050.
I also want to adhere to the measures of foods, and have been submitted to the conference of international understanding to the transparency of financial crisis.
The Indian Government is now going to the French headquarters, where the two-second meetings are prepared for the peaceful use of atomenergy.
In Paris, they trust that Indian atomreactors will be convinced in $20 miles of euros to build Indian atomreactors.
The Agreement shall be addressed to 15 years.

They found a billion of missing a year, Steve Fossett's airport.
They found the rest of the billion Steve Fossett Airport, which appeared on September 3 2007 on the named citizens.
On the rocks, there were 3000 meters of high pits, located in the front of the front of California and Nevada, in the front of Mamoth Lakes.
Human residences were not found in the aircraft.
John Anderson, shepherd Madera, all the existing challenges described: "We sent a team, and now we can be sure that there's a word about the machine that Steve Fossett will lose on the day of the airport."

Two, Fosset's legality, which made the Elilinois Refugee Observation, some prepared and a pool.
After a month of losing the challenge of the challenges, they have been raised.
The billion billion billion billions, which write in the story.
In 2002, the sixth trial, he had first a aircraft around the earth: two weeks of solitary air.
Three years later, he struck the earth, without destruction.
It's still a lot of records between Andok's airport, 15,445 meters high, which was achieved with a second pilot.
GLK, multiple records
An increasing, increasing and determined hobbiter, with large grounds and cutting skins.
Well, that's the last "compact creator" Mercedes-Benz, where the German car is trying to bring a fresh ship on the market.
The SUV GLK introduction campaign will also be surprised and increasing and increasing from October 17. October.
Likewise, the reclamation of the new vehicle is an unknown media-communication tool for an earlier time, among others, with a 3-D trip plaque, which was not yet used in Italy.
The horizon action from three sections will rule to November 15 to Milano's central entrance straight, the Corso Comot .
The first section of the new media-communication of this type is beginning to indicate the instruction of the car, which is in the framework of the new SUV, the Corso Como, with special eyes divided in the area, at least in real dimensions and three-dimensions.
The picture will be like a looker like the car's getting out of the planet.
Following this, the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK will be visible with all the details of the new GLK, and then be joined to a single image.
Unbelievable that Mercedes try to introduce something easy with this promotion in the car stereotype spectrum.
Do you sure you're going to make sure the interests of the soldiers?
Let's show who the Italian footballhuglians are.
Trivenetic boys, they're probably disappearing them from the balls.
But who is this 150-200 sons and girls who are now disturbed by all Italy? The group named "Ultras Italy" who follows the election since years, and who, according to the truth, has not caused a very big problem.
They've never met with the anticipated pigs.
The group should be right.
The main officers are coming from Trivento.
Something from Veron, Padda, Triest and Udine.
These were connected in Sofia from Campania and Puglia (only a few units).
The Italian shooters who were able to be identified in the southern parent: they took these in the room to not be identified.
They're following the example of the English smokers.
In Bulgaria, they looked at a real nazi surrounding team with the Levski prints.
The Italian football agreement was released by 144 for the disposal of the Italian Surkolars. These names were marks, so easier to check the Surkola team.
The Ministry of Investment was also checked: there was not one of the manufacturers in Sofia who had been processing, who would have stopped from the station.
Four Italian cycles who have the price linked to the labour were approved by the note and the shipment.
Currently, the Office Ministry waits for the documents from the Scientific police, then takes the necessary measures: those who are arrested or identified during the disasters can also be rejected by five years.
It is an international exemption that is not only Italian but the visit of all Europe's station.
So our footballhuglians can't do the legs to the only floor.
Good luck.
However, we have to keep that the bullians will find their followers, or that they will be attached to these hundreds of fifty heads, also others.
"It's not easy to save the one who is taking this." "It's the Ministry of the Office.
So it's better if we keep our eyes open, especially because it's close to the day of the serious choice, in the bed.
In Pulicia, it works like a smaller piece of Italian remotes.
Tomorrow, the Officer service is sitting, and the Commission on the Sport Security of Sports, which may also be considered in a detail of the internal security service, to the Secret Services of Short Security.
"Duce-Duce scanning and skinning hands under the Italian Himnois?
This thought was unfortunately unfortunately, Domenico Mazzilli, who was called for a few weeks to live the officer of the Office Minister (the post of Francesco Tagliente, and Felice Ferlizzi) before.
Mazzilli was the police captain of Triest, the city where one works since 2002, the Ultras Italian group supporter.
The Mazzilli is right, it is not supposed to live the Duce in Bulgaria, but from that there was even 150-200 surroundings.
I'm not a sociologist, he made him the first man of the controller service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where it is committed.
We need to examine what was exactly happened and how important it is to take.
But let's talk a little about the Italian himnous extinction: it's no crime, but if I'm free to say that, it's not possible to be called goodness."
