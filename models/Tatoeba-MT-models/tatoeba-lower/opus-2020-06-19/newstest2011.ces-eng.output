What's going to start? CHSSD in Prae doesn't know Voldemort or sugar
The new council City of the CSSD will have to convince a certain language barryer in order to understand their older colleagues from the ODS in the Prash Council and in advance.
The journal currently.cz members of the new Council of the CSSD "tested" as they know notaryly attached sounds that came to the Council during the last years when Praza ruled the current coalicial partners.
The coded dictionary, who carried out the rural political threat during the previous ear of the Prime Minister Paul Bema, describes some of the most known positions, situations and challenges in the metropolis.
It was surprised that the new advice of new advice was not too understanding.
At least it's going to say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prash policy a newspaper," he reacted to a "kmotrov" dictionary advice for the culture of Lukas Kauck.
And as it was about a political veteran, he reacted like Karel Brézin.
I need to buy the golf finger.
"It's the only expression of what you're supposed to me that I'm sometimes using."
"I don't usually recognize the dream."
With the dictionary that the journal expressions were currently published in June before the election Congress of the ODS, he chose six examples, overwhelming those who are nottically connected to the Prague Master.
The socialists had to explain the "Voldemort", "the biggest golf finger in Prase", "Go to the sugar," "sheep" "sheet" and "slove".
Three of the advice with a bird agreed, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who has to make the future to the Leader of Prash School - first promised conversation, but later he didn't take the phone.
The fifth advice Peter Doll rejected the test.
"I'm not going to solve these things, and as the civil democratics are talking about, I'm not going to be valued."
"I'm going to resolve how we'll understand in our programs," he replied.
As already mentioned, the advice of Luke Kaucky would not be considered in the title above that it was a word of influential business and a friend of the representative of Bema Roman Januško.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucke, and the only term that he was in the trial is "the biggest golf skin in Prase."
"It's a white tunnel," says Caucky, "but I know it almost from the news."
"I'm gonna have to pay some language curse," he's amazing.
The golf snake then as the white tunnel decrypts not only the master Karel Brézin, but also the joyful for the environment of Lukaja Plachí.
Both social democracies know who is actually Voldemort, and Lukaši Plachem is known and where this situation is to find - the meaning of the word "to go to the sugar" .
"I mean it means to go to some of the fresh business," is the Plach nearly discovery that it's about Janush's seat.
In accordance with Brussels, it reminds that knowledge has been cut off the news than to use such dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test frequencies, there is no similar vocabulary of sound expressions.
"I've also enjoyed the colleagues, but it looks like we have nothing like this."
"We are usually called names, sometimes the shortcuts and the names of the combined," says the Chairman of the CSSD Peter Hulinski, whose sides are considering Hulda.
"In school they called me Bryz, but I don't know if they're taking me the colleagues," admits Karel Bruzin's own overseer.
The journal actually. The name has tried and worked.
The Advisory Weinert is for the Sitters of Baby or less friends Children, Detective Miroslav Poche, who advertised to himself before the elections of the sponsoring sides, has some colleagues of the "Igrarch".
The surveys are also the only thing that the social democracies in the internal talk are allowed.
The Hulda Hulda does not like to hear, however, the journal actually.
"Doctor of Depression Law" remarks that Peter Hulinski has received his title JUDr. on the Brazilian Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the "Charodianics", brochure.
Women in Burkina Faso for the weekends have several common characters.
Often with elders, they can't get to work, for example, from health reasons, are free and don't have children.
The one who seems "sta" is sent to the isolation so that she doesn't threaten the rest of the ice.
"It might be a very damn thing."
"There's not related to young health women because they're helping to work and born children, "describes a row sister who is in the main city of Burkina Faso in the special house of more than one hundred women whose community has gone out of their order.
The local government has now decided to decline against the "social measures".
He delivered the information brochure that should help honour to restrict the chair.
But he's got a smoke.
"Only than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso can't read," noted the write lights of the Day Standard.
The conviction of the challenge is usually in other African countries.
In Ghana, who sits with Burkina Faso, last week, Ammy Hemma's twenty-year-year-old, died after her three women and two men, pulled the petroleum and burned.
The BBC server reported about the case.
The patterns say that it's been about the unfortunate agreement of the circumstances.
On the woman, according to their version, he elevated oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
He fulfilled after the group wanted a woman to "avoid a bad spirit."
Izolates "Charodianics" support people without regarding the achieved training level.
Deputy Der Standard quoted a 2030-year businessman from Burkina Faso: "The human souls have always been in danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the Government is trying to deal with the government, he still participated in Gambia in the lonely year.
"The President of Gambia Djammi after his teenager died, he broke a lot of horse on the rows that had been dealt with her death and tried to kill the black magic and the only president."
"Aid to help the chambers of the near Guinea, who, for the execution of police, soldiers, and the personal protection of the President, violated the rightly chosen men and women from the gambish former former farm in Kanila," brought in his report of Amnesty International organization.
In the farm, people had to drink a medicine with halucynogenetic effects, which also caused smoking and ledwich difficulties.
Two prisoners haven't been able to stay on the farm.
After international pressure, almost thousand prisoners were released to freedom.
Bakal's reserve: Topia in steams, highly signed
The old man departed from the door of the client center of the RPG Bty "hhlobaron" Down Bakaly, the biggest private owner of the residents in Sweden.
Under the sheep he sent a folder, and there is a new new covenant to three inhabitants: his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the trespasses.
All three just the deregulation took a ship.
Instead of 3500 months, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 corners from the next year.
"And it is not a dark water and tope must be petroma (man on the ball, name. red.)," indicates a man in the new covenant that the signature has full power.
"But I've signed it," explains the half-screen and half-screen.
The Civil Board of BytyOKD.cz, which the new minimum conditions have marked as "including and irregular", recommends the receivers to not describe and wait until 7 December when the public advice was made against them.
But the man just takes his hands on it.
"The one says it, the other it," he wept.
Ostravs becomes a big deregulator.
After the New Year, the largest majority of the lives in the Republic of the Czech Republic are still increasing.
Currently. That's why he decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
Average RPG is one of the fourth of the Ostravs and the fourth morning is already full.
Immediately, at the doors, the protection of the security agent and the calling equipment.
"Nour 2011," lights the special button on his touchive discipline.
One smoking and out of the machine is out of a number.
You don't have to read "157" and your digits are already busy on a large display under a waiter stream.
It's half the third time you're on the line.
On a minute, the old couple of marriage is coming to ask, and he was expected, but the new names are clearly not concerned.
Most people have come to resolve normal problems like one time - replacements, ensure events and similar.
The letters with new contracts are achieved in Ostravs in the mail guards of the majority of the passengers with the total of 44 thousand portfolios of RPG from half November.
RPG Byty proposes to increase the nomination of 15 to 38% in letters.
The special review to the new advice was opened on the client centre on 18 November.
"It's going for a week, so it's now in the case," the employees respond to a review for a minute of wrestling when the client is represented as newspaper.
The Deregulation and Bakal's old horn apartments are local ex-theme.
Before the choices, the President of the Parliament and the Australian Party Lubomir Zaoralek was able to be held, and now the local news are full.
"Twenty years after them, I'll make a new board."
"No bows have changed me on the west," he's in the front of a striking man.
At least, according to the employees, the officers are coming to convince whether they have a lie with the name if they are submitted during the time when RPG promises to them in the special offer.
It will also receive other rewards that submit the new Treaty to 15 December.
Average "Diregulation" review, but the questions are absolutely no longer.
"On yesterday 360 customers because of the nomination for 2011 was only about 40 to 50 people," they repeated.
RPG, however, proposes a individual agreement on the website and its prosecutions where it will be required.
However, if the name of both parties is inadequate, it must be determined by an independent judgment.
"It's not about disagreement, but information on the only possible and full legal procedure," advises RPG on its pages.
"Therefore no one will be judged," he thinks one of the RPG Bty employees and a man on the street before the client center gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13,000 officers and I have five thousand foods, I don't have to be judged," he says.
Works, but they're just needed.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek reports to them that they don't describe, so they're probably waiting for people."
The regulation of the nominations ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to RPG Bty, their economic needs.
"The staying weight is still not yet necessary for a simple maintenance of the residual fund," advised Paul Climesch, Director of the Research Portfolio of the RPG Bty, that the retainer of the residual fund is just a major reason for the increase of revenue.
During five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could be invested in four billion lives, for four years from 2011 to 2014, it must be 5.2 billion.
The large screen of visa in the woods against the pooled seats of the aircraft is still repeated some of the redly highlighted information.
"The increase of pregnancy in 2011 to 15% and less than 31200 bytes, it is more than 90% of RPG bytes."
"And it's always the best about 7,50 kg in the fourth and month," she appears on the screen.
Only at 400 bytes from RPG portfolio, 38 per cent will be taken.
"In these cases, the extern low degree of 19,66 Kč in fourth metre," notes RPG.
The next year of 2600 bytes will remain the same.
RPG Bty promises that the deregulation is not exhausted by the names of the skin, but it will be distributed for four to eight years.
Furthermore, it adds further obligations: all money from the increase of the name (see graph) gives the company back to the bathrooms, especially to the titsues - new windows and titsues.
They must first get people who submit the agreement on the increase of the taxes.
To the office is also school, they understood the architecture
The Administrative Building of Ario Point in Brna is a new seat of Arch.Design.
Nobody would expect that he also hides the ministry with all that is to be - with colored walls, ideal residence, buying the player and even the miniature on the outer teras.
Since October of the Long Year, they can visit her to the children of Arch.Design.
Arch.Design's project-architecton company, from which the ateliers have received a number of significant branch structures, was calculated with a space for her firm ministry since the first structures of the Avario Point building.
It works at least 90 people overwhelmed in the age of Babyboo, and it was concerned that women's projector and architects might be quickly returned to work.
Along with the possibilities of lost contracts is a school of benefits that Arch.Design offers his employees in the framework of the social programme.
Structurers and architectures have the possibility of employment with child.
The Ministry's employee Arch.Design, and with the support of the support of the European Union and the Ministry's work and social matters, has made them a question of the European Union and the Ministry.
The federal Ministry is financed from the means of the European Social Fund through the Operation Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the State budget.
Thanks to the grant financing (country at 2,8 miles. Kč) could buy equipment and equipment and ensure the qualified person and operation after two years.
After exchange of financing demand (2 years), Arch.Design has the obligation for 3 years to carry out a mini-country on its own costs.
The preparation of the project was a year and with a request for a question was significantly helped the Economy Rating company.
Feecher ensures the qualitative person, the child’s health sister and teacher MS, so they can go to school without an earlier limit, although most of them are older 3 years.
Because it's about "miniscole", now it can be only five children in the day, but it's going to be more.
Learning school is flexible according to the need of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regarding the hierarchie position in the company.
Although one of the individual education and training, the fulfillment of the Ministry is comparable to the framework programme of the primary education.
Children are not only playing here, but they are assured and quality study - from basic knowledge to prepare to school lavies, learning English.
The class is raised not only by games, but also for computers that children can use.
The presence of small children is directly in the business, it creates friendly and positive environments.
Family parents can control their child and disappear the stress situations with distracted children from schools remote from their parents’ work.
The parents use the work time more productive.
It is not amazing that there is naturally a loyal relationship of the employer - employer.
Arch.Design was so assigned to the Chess firms who offer significant benefits to the convention of new employees are friends to family, and through this programme he sent personal marketing.
The house of the bone fascinates even 100 years. Look at the interiors from Gaudi
The tree seems to be a grass of a honey, the board reminds the dinosur and the balls are open fishing of the mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batllo in Barcelona from the Catalán Architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house, he served his organic faces to the overseer of the house of the bones.
Organic skins, amazing colors, non-normal use of stones, cachels and mosaics, fasadians remembering shops and all-comprehensive skin crowns, all is typical for Antoni Gaudí's sessions.
The door of the house plays dream lines, colors and textures that remember natural and animals.
On detailed observation, it is to see geometric, ritm and exactly ideal line.
In the night, the whole fashion of the house is more dramatic, it is raised to get a color wood still raised.
Vision and closing faces are the same measure also shown in interiors.
The tree in the woods copys window frames, boxes, smooth elements of the door, coffee and sticks.
The house of Batlló, who stands in the fourth Eixample on the Russian Buying Street Passeig de Gracia No. 43, has rebuilt the house from Emilio Sala Cortese from 1877.
The rebuilding worked two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, the rich industries Joseph Batlló, originally continued to build old buildings and build a completely new, however, notably accepted Gaudi's idea on an ordinary and lower rebuilding.
Casa Batllo's home, but Antoni Gaudi didn't suggest himself.
He worked with his architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on his projectant decorations for representative residents of inability and the use of mosaic on fashion.
She worked on the fashion and a number of other creators and artists.
The social work on the proposals of Casa Batlló was a successful cooperation with Gaudim.
Jujol participated in the building of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and Güell park, where there are more Gaudi's work.
From the locals he served his organic faces by the "Home of the bones."
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, they started to call him "the home of the reaching."
It also says that on the top of the building is a sword of the Holy Jersey, Captain Catalan.
Hidden religion theme contains also other socarian elements.
Gaude in the house proposed a unique system of concentration with investment and typical commissions.
Weird can get their 40 and five degrees.
When Gaudi was created, he was not absolutely respected by the establishing rules, and he was not allowed to carry them.
At the beginning of the construction, the town's establishment authorisation received, however, the data on the planned rebuilding were so vulnerable that, for two years later, the town Council had been raised and requested the transport.
The advice was, for example, that the structure was driving a pilar and in a public passenger.
In addition, Joseph Batlló asked for the two highest fathers of the builder (and successfully received) to be allowed to prompt for the two highest building fathers.
The leader was alone raised up to the low father.
In the gallery in the second house, there was a community room and in the third room and private parts of the apartment.
The country was prononced by cleronicty.
The whole house of the sixtypath is cut off the board, which will be able to go up to a single throat.
The elements of the transformation were to discharge all the right angles and the right lines and their replacement with closed walls.
Gaudia also worked with the modern concept of removing space.
The Community part may be opened by the salon doors, and greater society can agree to communicate with it, and it would not also be maintained by the privacy necessary for intimate discussions.
The house with Gaudi's rebuilding has also obtained non-traditional disorders and two patterns more.
It also uses Gaudi's game with light, blue and white glassed perceived by the internal walls and lights.
The game two colors adds the maximum light in all the fathers of the house.
It was easier to make sure that the white turns light more than the darkness that the sun pattern even burns.
The house of Casa Batlló, which was held in 2005 to the world-heritage fund of Un Esco, can be visited.
In the first house's parent is the most prospective and honourable residence of public access.
For this step, the Leaders decided until 2002, in the opportunity, a hundred and fifty years of birth of the glorious creator.
At the view of the spectrum, they discovered that it was a very excellent business, and also the views were expanded on common and subtract spaces, including fire terrestries.
The income to the memory is decisively not able to do 16,50 euros and students, managers, groups and touristic tests have twenty percentage slight.
Summa is significantly exceeding the price of the incoming price to the other Gaudi Staff in the city.
If you want to read the right atmosphere of the house with smooth branches, you have to smooth with some of the residents and visit him right home.
How to choose mothers and adults: women have other requirements than men
Not any honourable frame of bed, but quality of low boards, so matrix and growth, gives the basis of a really good bed.
However, it must be harmonically fulfilled to exchange specific users.
In the choice, it decides many things, from weight, height, age, health stage and heads of managers.
It is also important to be the type of interference in which maternal and growth are raised.
Typical example?
It's not appropriate latex matrases because I'm fast "shirts."
Moreover, they are explicitly higher than the standard polyuretan matrix.
It is therefore necessary to turn regularly.
If they do not have a lot of suspicious channels in the kernel, and still lies on a strong deck, they keep the depth: it could be found under them, and the plot.
It also decides the sound when the election is selected.
Whoever traveled a longer time in the frontier where often uses a lot of high math with a smoking ground, it will be difficult to feel well on low and hard ground.
"Anybody who turned back from the NHL, I'm surprised that they're not going to get here."
"In their covered branches, patterns and sides, they needed matrace with a smoking ground line ring."
"That is the need for people with sugar who have a threat of the nervous system, so they take badly, information" from clowns and skins," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who is specialized on the locked apartment.
Many hokejists, but also the other lawyers, therefore, matrace with a lensy pound for years ago.
"Today it's all right, the correct math needs Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also the Chinese Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL box to appreciate the line.
This "shirt" works easierly.
Optimizes your tumor and face in accordance with the absorbed temperature or applies to your body.
You're not going to shoot. You're not going to be turned as a hard shot in the night.
You'll just drink better.
The lineal pound also works as a protector from the prosecutors.
If you choose the math size to your higher, add the length of the road, which is at least 21 to 34 cm.
The husband also with a woman around 180 cm so needs 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be at the duplex of 90 cm, therefore 180 cm.
In other beds, for example, in singlists, recommends at least 120 to 140 cm.
For the opportunity of a visit.
"Inak is a simple rule for the leafness of the leaflet: you should have the hands fully fully satisfied in the place," advised Ing. Helena Prokop, the chemical Czech Cell and Decorators who have the problem of health and the ethnology of the residence have been driving for a number of years and leaving it in separate schools.
In the double box, each own growth and matrix needs, however, in the case of buying in order to smooth the heights of the matrix.
In other ways, there will be nothing other than mounting growth into various highways, however, it will not have to be able to stay at each frame of bed.
Fine matrices should have at least 14 cm height, types with a plot curve at least 15, at least three centimeters count on the carbon and purchase level.
"When you touch your hand or getting to the mother's mother, you don't have to feel nuts," he warned Helen Procock.
Each mother requires a certain type of roses.
The entire bed, when matrace and base are like a huge seams, they don't have anything to do in the beds.
Mothers are wrong winds, they can't be able to spare their grounds that's already normal today.
And because we usually increase 0.2 to 0.75 l pool in the night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the math will begin to remind one of the large (and the nuts) network.
That is why the experts refuse the reviews of maternal life to 25 years or even useful clusters.
However, everything has its own.
And this is why the advice of the property from the soldiers: in the maternity is 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and works a sniper steel, but please add a mature protector that you can easily slide and spare.
Although maternity rates are usually produced today, we will get two parts (for money and size of money), yet it could be manipulation in large types (and at one man) when we take a picture of the range of low smokes in the ring with hard.
Do you have a pitch place in the bed?
Never!
Maximum on the bed set for visits for one night.
However, react (if it is no longer) wind-building, and use matracies with low cow and at least 15 cm with skins (including. Taschenfederkern) and buying grounds.
Polyuretan matrace doesn't look like that.
On the non-lame rose of 14 to 18 lamels will be appropriate latex or sandwich matrace (the latex and cocos), but you will always be paid with a larger number of lamelets, 28 and more where lamps are doubled in the beder area and are possible to regulate their tubs.
With half lame roses, matrace is not compared to a plot cart because they do not react to the position.
In the setting of the lame, the lame can be able to reach and also the ramen cool.
It's about a special smoking lame that allows to touch, or even clone the lame so that the rame sleeps well "beaten".
For men who have "margins throughout the bottom," a decisive important thing.
Even the manufacturers have already remembered her, who have started to use the amazing area in the framework.
Women also remember - they reach the smooth grounds in the cigarettes.
For the latest annual recorders, the crowds or desticks are defined with multitorical perishment.
The click is based on more points and is reduced.
In particular, when you use the correct matrix and grow a bad pool (gross and "trained"), most of the "plaus" will be dismissed.
The basic rule is easy: the boxer must subscribe the head and the hairs to contain only to the frames, so that they can leave the branches.
As appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, for example in Skandinavia.
When leading on the side, the pool should be equipped (country with a ramen round or a smooth zone in matrix) of the height of the branch.
Modern matras have only something common with the original slamers full of travines.
Their manufacturers still use natural materials or at least a matter.
The train is just in math bio.
Surveys from which polyuretan pounds produced are replaced by natural oil, for example from skin and soil.
It's just a soil. It's almost all of the products known.
"It means that the nuclear is produced from the pure nature of nature," explains Peter Yoursscheck from Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used in the production of maternal plants, one of the first was aloe true.
But you can take the microshops to leave you with the woods or leading.
There's a separation for men and women.
While the man's "whale" is a growing extract from the breasts to absorbe the darkness and smooth the body, I'm even women's throat of "tope".
Extract from the red pattern increases blood circulation, so it's the heavy head of teploy.
A favorite today?
Matrix produced from hot pound (he has more pounds with a low cell structure, it is so easier than a normal polyuretan and offers a better elasticity.
Combination of various skins and "line" hots cause multizone matrases that exactly know where to be head, hair and paths.
For the quality matrix you'll pay from seven thousand corners and high.
Those who fulfil the health parameters have the lower DPH rate are the doors as healthy help.
As the first occurred in the Czech Republic on this Gumotex exhibition.
Watching mother and growth isn't easy.
Sometimes, you can use the operations of manufacturers or vendors that offer two matrices for one price.
The Magniflex tag offers Duofreeze mother with all the memory cups of Memory to the bottom of 11 990 corns.
However, the second can be able to argue.
The driving or vicoelastic ports with a open cell structure and a high hust was started with the "cosmical" term of the Tempur material.
He was raised originally as a material for the NASA because at the beginning of the astronauts were established anormal suffering.
The temperature in the shadow is smoking, and the weather is once convinced.
Think of the human body is so perfectly applied and optimally spreads his pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the relationship, but also for the increase of comfort to sleep.
Viscoelast pipes are used not only for matrace but also for health products, needs to be special pools under feet that are departing from the feet and the living system.
The manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
People's monitoring tools want more parents, so they want to hunt their children
The fear of the child is still leading more people to the thinking of GPS.
The system originally created for car rentaling can also monitor people's movement, and thus help them in such cases as the 19-year-year-old Anich's missing.
The device is still big as a smoke from the shirt, soon, but it can be big just as hours.
A number of people raised the case of lost Aničan and began to drink through media as to protect their children better.
And for the privilege of their privileges.
"We're trying to say to all that it's not about any spreading, but on another means to reduce the probability of a tragedy," says Peter Pilin from Macro Weil company, which is one of the reviewing devices on the Czech market.
"I assume that, in some case, it may be possible to disturb such devices, even if they get into the taste of someone who doesn't know about it, but we're still not talking about this case."
"A majority of it really buys from safety reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, the kid should always know what the purpose of the "club" is to serve and how it is used in the case of noise.
The child's psicologist Dana Bočk warns that if the child doesn't want to take anything like that, it's just gonna be saved.
"And very small children show great creativity in how some things are accurately lost if they don't want to be under control."
"The great expectations were chosen before by the parents of the mobile, however, to disable the same as this monitoring device," says Bočk.
It is also sportable if such equipment really helped in the case of the attack.
"If it is prepared, the truster will always make sure that the child has no electronic that could see his position."
"Now it's a phone."
"When they start to expand the monitoring devices, they will also look for them because their selling will certainly be submitted to massive reklame."
"In such case, the criminals will always be on a step before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it advises that such devices can help in the case of an inadequate attack of pedofilem.
According to Robert Cheche, the RC Monitoring company, which offers monitoring services as for cars, as well as for persons, even if it comes to the immediate destruction of the monitoring device, it can help him.
"The device can set up a regular sending of positions after a certain period."
"If it comes to his curse, it's at least the last place of the person who's touched."
"The severe devices have built and naclometers, so even if a man just smokes and remains immediately lying, sends the device to warn with the location immediately," says Chech.
According to him such service, they can carry smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to load special software.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that it is about equipment similar to the size of the box from a series or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so painful of their loss.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, it is now testing the device that looks like normal digital hours.
"This will be the biggest achievement in that the accidental aggressor doesn't need to know the monitoring device."
"He's known until some time and it can give the police time more," adds.
While the monitoring devices are already carried out into the frameworks or tracking, they will still use the same technology that is used to monitor cars.
It is about a combination of the detection of the location through the GPS system (in which uses regular autonavigation) and the mobile phone function that is reporting the current car position.
The army's got fired shirts that they'd have the Chess, but he's only two years.
The Czech Army buyed 445 kilometers of shiner, with which the markets are burned.
The Ministry's defence has already been added to 224 kilometers of breeding.
The soldier has 225 years.
The problem is that dutyness is two, maximumly four years.
The army buyed steams from the STV Action Group, e.g. for 40 million corners.
General ships in the achievement of the purchase of such a large quantity of MF DNES branches rejected that soldiers need 60 miles of burning a year.
However, from the numbers of military pyrotechnics MF DNES, it describes that, then, very intensive pyrotechnical efforts would have to travel each year and all general, officers of military, secretariats or strippers.
The Minister of Defence of Alexandra Vondru and the Officer of the Officer of the Proprietary Pick doesn't take it.
It's just so that it's possible to cause an annual consumption of military 60 miles of burning.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's resources would be enough for more than ten years.
If it would also be paid that for the basis of each new professional employee is sufficient to the top of two meters of the shoes, as the experts say, the army has secured the pure purchase - and with the increased consumption of women or special units - resources for 225 years.
The brigade soldiers, however, have recently suffered the Ministry of Vondro that they have almost no bottles in the arms, so they are also shoes because of the noise of money restricted.
It's not enough for the ground.
"It's not my head that they're buying a lot of burning from us."
"But it's their decision and they're sure they know what they're going to do."
"For us, it's an army of a good lawyer that we're trying to explore as businessman," says the STV Group Jan Thanks.
The speaking Ministry of John Peychek's Protection causes hundreds of kilometers purchased branches and that the army will have the resources of this "munice" at least ten years.
John Thanks to the STV Group, however, talks only about four years of life in the field and police or military pyrotechnology even for two years.
"For perfect storage, it can also be those four," says one of them who's as a soldier because of the army criticism doesn't want to publish the name.
After the appliance of life, every municipality must be tested hardly if it is still aware and does not threaten the soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not increasing, and they have more money.
The next argument of the Ministry is a multiple term to 445 kilometers of the branch shirt.
"We have been 60% less than a lonely advantage of two hundred and forty-fourth kilometres," the Peace talks about the advice of the Ministry of Protection.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics who lift municipes from the second world war or here after the Soviet Army is not exceeding a few years of 1 500 meters.
And the police is always involved in such a number of municipalities to use this municipality still before the appliance of life.
It was witnessed to her for the safety of pyrotechnics, and he can also get more moderate, and then even more similar types of shirt.
The Ministry of Defence has already a significant difficulty to live ten thousand tonnes of tonnes from the time of the Warshaw Treaty when the twenty-slovakian military was prepared to tackle on Ryn.
Here's the chess based on the pyrotechnics that MF DNES raised, waits for a few years this problem: it's gonna lift up hundreds of miles of old packs that buys "lacino" today.
Today, I've got the contacts that I have received
The winning place in the Year's Conference, Lukasi Pytloun helped Lukasi Pytloun to sell the French of his hotel.
By the winning of the last year's conscience of the Year's Worker, Lukas Pytloun became a employer of Liberce.
His story is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun liked to go.
And in the foreign, he realized that in Liberia there's no quality residence for a understanding price.
From the construction of the border brigade and by the bank credits, he buyed a half-bound house with five apartments.
At that time he was still a third-year-old student, it was a great depression.
"Therefore I don't give me the dimension between quality and price of residence with us to try to do something," says Luke Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment began to make interest to the frontier employees.
All the gas invested back to the house that went on to the pension with 54 beds.
Since seven years of enterprise, he was attempted to open four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity over 300 beds of all inhabitants.
The most comfortable of them was a four-star Pytloun design hotel.
Anyway, it came to him another, the same quality.
"Now we have a contract signed with the hotel in Tize, where we sold our French concept and other interesters of the Pytloun's Franzing Hotels are reported," says the lonelian food number one.
"And on this vending licence to carry out the hotel with a large measure of winning in the Year's Worker's age," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberce and around.
"The people knew me on the streets, often welcome me, and I have to say that it was pleasant," she remembers.
The participation in the co-party recommends all who are trying to do something.
There's no need to win, every visit is good.
She says that she's still smoking from contacts and knowledge that couldn't even get.
"I started business regularly."
The honour linked with successfulness according to him has become a little bit of every employment.
And that they have about seventy.
"I'm watching the greater loyalty of them and the happy to share in something that has obtained a global recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of a good job to all of us together."
"It's just my name's shooting in the front," says Luke Pytloun today.
I'm going to get my training more calm than we had in Farmet.
Euforia was quickly exposed the crisis impacts.
Thanks to the target of the wind, however, Farmet has worse times behind himself.
For the price of the first place in the past year of Vodafone Firma, he got the leader of Farmet, Karel Judiar.
The party therefore evaluated the effort that he built from a small instrumental party in the Czech scale of the company with a millions of reactions.
"I can say that the appreciation has built me not only, but all my co-operators and has increased our self-consciousness for the concurrency," says the lonely wind today.
At the beginning of Farmet's story, Farmet's room was to do something useful.
So, when the father of Karla Jiddar was offered to pronounce a small party as a compansion for the communist's packed mate, he refused the carrier in the company where he worked then, and with several friends around his dad's father put a company on the plastic vans.
Until later, they started specializing on vegetable oil lizzles.
After eleven years, the largest manufacturer of automatic licenses in Central Europe became the largest.
The larger conscience and between the unexpected publicity of the company has been achieved after the success of the media.
"No only our advocats began to consider Farmet's mark very better, but also the foreign partners began to assess that they cooperate with the company that has been achieved in their country's greater success," says Karel Jude.
However, the anniversary was not only in Farmett's sign of the evacuation.
The assessment has resulted from the financial results of the company to 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The crisis that has not yet touched the citizens, but the companies have already stopped their investment projects and have started to limit the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, hasn't missed us."
"We have to limit the production, and we have to go to avoid," explains Karel Judician.
Life companies must sometimes be able to make such non-popular measures.
But the situations have been able to control and the company hold in the weight, even if I'm less than the crisis.
However, from what they didn't lie in Farmett is investment to research and development.
"We made a research and school centre, we sent presentations on international branches, we received the main evaluation in household exhibitions," says Judician.
Everyone proves that the crisis is behind them.
They will grow again and with them and the number of new employees.
"The new victory is a pleasant feeling of winning, but in a quiet atmosphere," says Karel Judiar.
Anket that removes insensitive provisions
Ankett on Absurdite year is a number of business claims.
Some insensitive provisions have already been able to interrupt.
The unseen winning of the next year Anket of Absurdita was the responsibility for the document offices that also are available on-line.
She decided about this more than the third of the four thousand votings.
For example, the social security management required a document from the business record, even if the officer can get it by two clicks of the mouse.
Thank you, too, it's gonna change.
"The Chess Management of Social Security Affairs will not require any explanation from the business register in the controls of the security plots, "CSSZ Jan Burañ's speaker.
Avoid all provisions and Regulations that require companies and businesses in the Sweden to fulfill, and those insensitive to abuse are the meaning of the consent of Absurdita's year.
These years are already a major part of the business claim of the Economic News and the public is still more happy.
If the votes were participated at about three thousand votings, the years were almost four thousand years ago.
And there is no wonder, the most different legal obligations that serve only to maintain business are still enough and enough.
"We need in the number of records to recognize the data in the front areas of the world," says Karel Havlíčk from the Association of Small and Central Companies and Funds.
In the last years, the assembly of business is a pronounced target of all governments.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improved.
According to the World Banks, the Czech Respect of the conditions of business was located at the 74th position, it is about eight places far more than the lone.
Absurdita was first published in 2006, and the same scenario is performed each year.
Appearance of administrative and burocratical senses can anybody, each year from April to the end of September, when the consent is closed.
To login, the Web address www.company.cz After the officer chooses seven candidates on the "anticine" and allows it in the process of October to vote publicity on the websites of www.company.cz/absurdita and www.ihnd.cz.
Absurdity that will get the most of the voices of win.
The aeroplane has been invited to more than one hundred, exceeding 105 provisions and Regulations of the comprehensive meaning.
The types sent businessmans, but also professional weddings and newspapers.
Inter "finalists" involves such as the named oceans, for example, the requirement to pay the cars for the daily and speed-behaviour, or to employees with twenty employees, two officers and two toalettes every two years.
The list of aeroplane seven proposals is published on the pages of consolidation.
The statement of the concurrency, which is always in the beginning of November in the Vaclav Objective in Praia, is part of the hapenning which is regularly participating in the political and social life.
For example, for example, the committee has assisted Eva Freedom, Director of the Association of Small and Middle Affairs and Food Affairs, or Peter Kužel, President of the Economic Communities of CHR.
"Economic prosperity can't work there where the state's households are locked under the feet, so it's my goal to cancel at least three decades of paragraphs that are very complicated today," shared the Minister of Industries and the business of Martin Kocourek.
Intended to move the unintensive Regulation, it does not take effect.
In 2007, the most important obligation of the employer to report the three days before the food Office in the place where the permanent operation was placed, the purpose to go to the board or to the board.
This obligation was removed by the new living law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was declared by the Office of the Office for its foreign employment of service travelling for 30 days, was removed by the law on such green map.
And at the third of all good.
In the year 2009, the physiotherapy Regulations have been made in order to have a great stripe, a driving, and two weights.
This was deadlined in the aeroplane year of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have an aircraft was departed.
The new category assesss the companies responsible for the Community
The values are environmental, humanitarian, education or sport projects.
The newspaper in the fifth year of the Economic News is the category called the responsible company of 2010.
I send this contribution is the support of the intelligence and fair business.
"We want to support such companies that affect the impact of their business on environment and support social responsibility," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of mobile operator, Vodafone company, who is a speaker and guarantee guarantee, as well as in the case of the rebellion of the year.
At the first year of this special subcategory of Vodafone Firma, this special subcategory was reported to the companies that have not been successful in the business of this only long-term goal.
The advantage of each of them is very inspired and would give it to the same article.
Although its activity is one of the other diameterally different, their joint namer can consider support and sustainability.
In one case, there is such a personal problems or health of own employees.
Thus, among the fourteen Celopical Finances, the ships of Et Netera, which supports the creation of non-formal sport teams between employees, which are then participating in various sports.
Another example, Isolit-Bravo's responsible company from Pardobian country is the principal contributor of the local fund of the sponsorized children.
His healthy employment is replaced by the posted paper, which has more than 70 per cent, and therefore received the title of the responsible company of the Central country and in Vodafone Firma in the year as a third country.
On Olomouck the account company MiRyz Soft, which carried out a period of work, was also reduced at the average of 35 hours a week, but without a strict reduction of payment.
The title also made her rate for the purchase of the Chess manufacturers, supports citizen activities in close areas and environmental protection.
"We're trying to recycling the best that our business and the administrative have the less impact on the environment," explains the member of the Love Rygnor.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the East country is again thinking of the health of his employees and to each notebook gave them ethnic cycles and keyboards, supporting their work from home and their business actions uses catering services provided for local protection.
"Moreover, we support the positions of a man in the pressure that helps specifically the local Roman community," says the representative of the Ondrej Search company.
In the past, there are also the activity of the Pran and the cleaning of the Carlovar country, which contributes to its employees in the form of super-standard bonds in their penalty connection.
"We give us new articles on the pain, transport, improvement of qualification and recreation," says Josef Strappač from the Bruntal Staff Company Czasch, winning in the Moroccoland country.
In the category of the responsibility of the year, all national entists of Vodafone Firma were automatically income, which answered the questionnaire to the income and sent it later to August 15.
The incorrect or unfulfilled answers in the questionnaire were issued by the officer of evaluation.
"If the members of the companies have not responded to questions, they could not participate in the responsibility of the year, but they are not discovered from the "Head" Corporation of Vodafone Firma's Year."
"Santomatical login is not possible only in this conference, because it is a subcategory of the main companies of Firma year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose.
At the Agricultural Fund in Plzni Police, the public challenges were occupied
In the Construction of the Agricultural Fund in Plzni in the past days, the anti-corrupt police was attacked.
The green detectives set a local business in the medium scene and the businessman with Luboši G realities.
This was fully tried to manipulate a public cohesion in order to prepare restitution procedures so that the resources offered in the cohesion may receive a specific interest.
He had to pay for Lubosh G. half a million corners.
"I can only ensure that the police is a person for the transaction of the public defence and public court," said the Procedure of the Chief of the State Procedure of Antonia Green to provide further details on the investigation.
The police employees of sixty-five-year officers left freedom after 24 hours.
In the meaning of how the public cohesion could affect, the minimum official information is only to speculate.
The Agricultural Fonds of Lubomira Black on the question of the Right pointed that the police policy was actually involved in the public cohesion.
"It was about the client, not any of our employment," she surprised.
The public council has the right name of the "Conference to introduce the proposals for the translation of the lands through the law of the wedding" and it will be done in the case of the offered location of more authorised requests.
"These persons in the framework of the call offer higher value of their restitution procedures to be arranged by the transfer than the value of the ground."
"After the proposed proposals, the orders of residents are established and the ground fund will then transmit the locations to the person who offers the most higher propositions," explained the speaker fund.
Luboš G., of course, had information that had been income, and because it was also a right person, because he had buyed a number of refunds, offered the interester of the posts that it was not party.
It's a lot of insect for that.
That would explain that he had such a big sum of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had standard contacts with PF in Plzni in the past.
In the case of the former boss PF Vaclava Sankota, he was punished in the case of the replacement of the lands on which a decision had already been issued on the location of the building.
Just then Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, lands designed for public communications, particularly in the place where the coming officer should be established in the industries of Borsca field.
Afterward, he changed them very excitingly with the manager in the own historical center of the city, which had a lot of higher value.
Then the railway had to come to it because otherwise, the blocking of the grounds of the grounds would be worried.
Works for households for hundreds of monthly payment
The households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and steel, steel advantages, and somewhere to be able to take.
The family will have to get out of the money from January to a hundred corner monthly more than now.
Electrical health until 4,6%, the floor will be about 2% more red, until at the decade you will have to pay for water addictions and many of them also undertake the addiction of the central temperature.
Electronic training should be households in bathrooms for a year on the steady driving than now.
The prices of power electricity, however, reduced all the main additives, is therefore a significant increase in support of energy production from renewable resources, especially photovoltacs.
Plyn's still healthy, however, in the time that people are the most tough and they have the most highest consumption.
So, yearly, it must also be numbered by hundreds of more corners.
While electronic and plots are healthy throughout the Republic, the price of the central expenditure is different from the location.
The increase of prices plans mainly greater foreign.
For example, households in Pardubics or King's Gardens will be paid from January for a central expenditure at about 50 corners a month more than 1000 corners in Liberia.
The residents of Praha are again threatened that more than 9 per cent of the water and stainless health, and that, if the city is increased in the rate of the infrastructure.
If the valuable changes are paid, 6,8 per cent will be paid.
However, the price in Praia will continue to be in the entire public comparison between lower.
On the north of the Chech, where the price is now between the highest, has water and steady to reduce 7,4 per cent.
They may, for example, increase the price of less than 450 thousand rates, where the annual ends of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Baty company, which is in the Occupation of the Lab’s own atmosphere of 2500 bytes, has to be achieved from a year to a hundred percent.
Those who don't agree with the new higher name should be given the court.
Regulated taxes paid by people in approximately 300 thousand bytes could increase the next year to ten percent.
The Children are driving by fernet and round. Pivo is out of the way, it's a little effect.
Fernet, rum, water, exclusively the best mark of whisky struck for parents.
These are the drinks after the eating of the most part of the opposition of the doctors who were not yet 15 years.
Except, there are no children who are in the hospital repeatedly treated.
It is exceeding the experiences of doctors who have similar cases on children’s division.
"My drinks or wine are very bad, because it's long before you're able to shoot them."
"Trangem is certainly a severe alcohol," shared the Prime Minister of Children's Division in the Mediterranean Czech Human Pelikan.
"When they're going to get out of the box, it's needed to be a whisky, but it's controlling Fernet and water."
"It's not so much to feel," explained the primary.
And for the truth he gives him the Faculty hospital Motel Eva Jurin.
"The most part of it is Fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in basic schools."
"In some cases, it was a promise that they brought out of the house," said Jurin.
According to the primarios of Pelikan, trety or fourteen years of drinking on hospital accommodation.
Before the horizons, where it was from the air year, he worked ten years just at the pediatrie in Motole, where the sanitaries are cutting up the high schools from the wide area.
"It's a girl with us, like, four times."
"The carrier started in 12 years when her brought her to us with 3,5 per cent of alcohol in blood, more in combination with the extase," the doctor wrote particularly a serious case.
"It's been on the exhibition of the Holeshows on some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come especially that she didn't know about her daughter 48 hours," she looked at the primary.
In fact, parents or even their significant tolerance to drink their own descendants are considered as the main cause of growing children's drinking.
However, in the meaning of the right meaning, the employees with children are not able to speak.
"After alcohol, a few years of chronic impact on alcohol with all the fenomens that are to be, and it's not for children."
"To those who use alcohol repetitively, it's almost a significant family-social background," explained the Prime Minister Pelikan.
According to Jurin's periods on a pediatric clinic in Motole, they were hospitalized at the half November forty-fit children.
However, the statistics will only be obtained with severe infections that had to stay in the hospital.
Children's opts who take their parents after a ambulance investigation, in case they're home to carry the police, do not be calculated anyway.
Furthermore, when children just sit down after school and drink railways, there are three series of seasons that can be achieved: chambers, Silvester and the end of the year of school.
"It's what they're going to drink from a bad statement, or they'll glorify the beginning of the empty."
"In particular, on the wednesday, I've bought seven kids at the same time," said Pelikan.
The medicine who keeps the detoxic night under the monitoring of the doctors is paradoxically in the absence of the one who is in the second day in the house of the inacceptable cocobine.
Morning pains of the heads caused by dehydration and glucose is also caused by glucose infusion with glucose and animals that are missing by the body.
"They're actually better than that because they're having a beautiful nightmare and a good refugee, and nothing's hurt."
"It's only a disagreement of where they are," said Pelikan, to sometimes find a favorable reward to the patients at least the costs that they requested.
Transport sanitary and hospitalization to the acoustic bed is also out to ten thousand corners.
"In sometimes I applied it as an essential media when I paid to those kids right and then on the vision, how much of their shopping stood and that they could also travel the whole year on the Brigade to work on that evening," added Pelikan.
However, health insurance, according to him, to the regression management, in which after parents, the costs of treatment are not accessible in cases of children’s struggle.
Two airlines L-159 are first in external hands in Spain
Two aeroplanes L-159 from the entire five cups, for which the Chess Ministry's defence has changed the transport airport Casa C-295M, in the outside along the Sevilly Spanish, where the manufacturer Casa - EADS was located.
It's the first thing that the machines appeared in the property of someone else than the Czech Army.
In the strangers, they were just on the ships or foreign years.
It is about a double version of L-159T1 which still carried out the Chess Army and were aeroplane.
The rest of three machines are single L-159.
They still are conserved in the Air Vodochod and the business mediator - the Omnipol company - has been over the last week.
When the air is physically declared from the Waterwood, it is not according to John Peashka from the printing department.
"United airlines L-159 for the change have been completed from the long-term of the aircraft, without any other investment and investment from the Ministerial Resources."
"Double L-159T1 has been changed in the present state and form," said the Prophecy.
It added that the army was not stayed without twice aircraft because the Ministry was signed in May 2009 with the Aeroport Aeroplane Aeroplane for 200 million corners to retain four non-necessary machines L-159 to two two-minute machines.
One new aircraft was able to move the army in July, the second we're going to the end of the air year.
According to the Peso EADS, the aircrafts are driving into the arms of some other countries.
"In the Treaty, it is clearly indicated that the L-159 aeroplane is the EADS company and they will serve for the exploitation of pilots from the NATO country."
"Therefore the things are chosen by the way this thing will be done," said the Pharisees.
The Economic News have noticed that, for example, the Spanish Army on L-159 doesn't matter.
The change of five L-159 for one aeroplane Casa and the purchase of three other aircrafts of 3,5 billion corners approved the lone of the Government Mirka Topolanca.
The Ministry of Defence was not described on the purchase of the election management, and directly the EADS.
Following the leadership of the defence was argumented that transforming the future exports L-159 to the border.
The Czech Army buyed 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24 machines, and the rest would want to sell.
The Casa airport will probably have a judicial rate.
The European Commission also invited the Ministry of Defence to the European Court because the aircraft had had been chosen on the basis of the European trend and none of a manufacturer.
The army has already reached three avenues of Casa, the last would have to go to Kbely forty days.
More indicator than the sticker means less the risk of the skin
Mans who have a shower lower than a sticker are made by a small risk that the diseases are cut off forests.
It's a wonderful conclusion of the study that published in the middle of the Britann Report.
It can be related to the fat man's hormone of teststerone.
"Our results show that the relative length can serve as a simple test of the risk of the prostitute, especially for men to 60 years," reported the copy of the study of Ros Eeles, Professor of the Institute for the investigation of the rack in Warwick University.
It would be like to help us to determine who men should achieve the test of prost race, especially in combination with genetic risks or other threatening factors, such as the family health care, added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, there were more than 1500 patients with rack-prostitution and community over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had an indicator on the right hand shorter than the sticker.
He paid for them the same probability of ransoms as for 19% of those who were lying was the same long.
In the case of those who had a indicator lower than a sticker, however, this risk increased 33 per cent, for men to the sixty-sixteen, even 87 per cent.
The rate of the length of two mentioned boards - created in prenatal period - of course, the various hormones of head hormones which the child is established in the work.
Least the teststerone corresponds to the more indicator.
Previous studies showed that the teststeron is just supporting the growth of the prostat racon.
The preceding Chinese genetic and the previous president of Academy, Professor Vaclav Pačs for the CTK said that he knows regularly about this study, but it seems not to be sure that the relationship between the length and the rabbit was "completely pronounced".

The smoking in Sweden is once staying.
The American soldiers have a new gun.
The American army set up a new "chitrou" weapons in Afghanistan. They are still known under the XM-25 code mark.
Generals hope that the new automatic puzzle affects the entire conflict with Taliban and "modify game" in their efforts.
The new weapon is something like a little superperson.
She's projected by the laser with a number of meters.
Specific packs are 25 mm, exploited for this box and containing high exhaust market, actually work as small granates.
The packs can be programmed so that they will not only explode in the narrow, but in any point of their ballistic ways.
Therefore, it can be used against the enemies who are hidden for some rebellion, walls, or captures.
The Shora is usually not protected, and when the murderer rain is rained on him, it can get it out of the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, is a new puzzle of the first weapons for a bitch that uses the "smart" technology.
"The soldier with her is based in order to find a target, send a laser ropesk that defines a distance, so he gets a targeted target point, and he's going to edit the purpose and cut out the round."
"Let's say you've got 54 meters."
"When you press the bottom, the weapons will be shooting and burning the shooting on the distance of 544 meters plus -1, two or three meters," said Audette.
400 workshops
Concern Fujits moves his neighborhood from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their employment place in July of the next year from a suitable administrative building at Marienbader-site in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese concert Fujits moves his neighborhood from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he shared the gigant in the abortion specialised on the computer and their maintenance, moved in July of the next year 400 men and women of their job location from a suitable administrative building at Bad Homburg in Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in the Lyon Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Nederrad.
According to the explanation of the speaker Fujist, there should be more than 100 other concerts, which are then divided in the region.
The nomination offer was very atractive and explorer officers in Astro Park in a lot of workshops.
Also in Bad Homburg was Fujits only in the name.
The competent officer Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central seat with a wonderful infrastructure."
The great connection with the air is just for the global society as Fujits is very important.
The recent steps of important enterprise in the region have been invited yesterday to joy in wines and decreases.
The Economic Referency in Frankfurt Mark Frank (CDU) said that this was able to get a "global player".
It's "the fantatic show of trust in this location."
Fujitsu is gone to the city, the seat is an important impulse for Nederrad.
Ancient Bad Homburg, Michael Korwis (Green), litised Fujit's decision.
The city was notified at the time by the leader of the company on its purpose.
"Obviously, we offered our company our help," said Corvis.
Aming contacts were not able to change the difficulty of the computer producer with an interesting ability on Marienbader's business.
The results have been decided for economic reasons.
Now it's about that it's a long disaster in such a prominent place.
"I hope he'll be the leader and the prosecutor of the building's cooperative."

Amazon locked server - exchanges against Assange
Wikileaks gets in the shoes.
Amazon's Internet service has been running on its platform servers for disconnecting.
It may happen to the political pressure after the publication of the statistics of the secret diplomatic depths.
Wikileaks Assange is fully maintained in the United Kingdom.
Wikileaks, a platform for the disappearance, is available in the United States under still larger pressure.
Internet activists have lost access to their custom home server in America and now look for Internet home in Europe.
In the meantime, Joe Lieberman called the prominent American senator of other countries and businesses to fight Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led to the list of searched interpols, has to be held in accordance with a new story in the Great Britain.
"Wikileaks isn't on the Amazon server."
"Free view in the free country," published a active publication to a short Twitter report in the middle of (local time).
A short time, Amazon's documents of Wikileaks from their servers were downloaded.
Internet activists used when publishing secret diplomatic depths Amazon Web Service (AWS) to control the high number of access to documents.
The Twitter services explained Wikileaks to this step, "Well - our dollars are now lost because we're working people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with the free show, "What should they stop sold books."
Amazon stopped the use of his servers for Wikileaks after the private collaborators of Senator Joe Lieberman made a training, published the CNN TV station on the basis of the information of the office of Lurman.
The President of the Senatary Committee for the Protection of the house was threatened by Amazon's fight, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to come to this step before, in view of the previous publication of the classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieutenant invited him to have a platform in the use of the servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is one illegal, irrespectively and irrespective, and this is our national security established in dangers and endures the lives on the whole planet," states in one statement of the nonstrantic senator.
"No responsible companies - whether American or foreign - wouldn't have to help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the broken material."
The manufacturer of Wikileaks Assange, who is searched for Sweden authorities because of deceiting, is on the list searched by Interpol.
On the basis of the reports in the London News The Independent, Australia's 39-year-old 39-year-old, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has always marked research in Sweden for the intriction of his adversaries.
The Vikileaks Christin Hrafnsson in London said that he also came to the shop.
"They were even calling to kill Julian Asrange."
That's why Assange's right to fear their security, said Hrafnsson.
That is why Wikileaks will be hidden and continue.
Hrafnsson, of course, reacted to the explanations from North America.
In America, Mike Huckabee requested the previous Republic Governor Arkansas, to be a person responsible for publication on Wikileaks because of condemnation and treatment.
In Canada, an advice of the Government of Stephen Harper in the television said to be an ironic, Assange should be " murdered" and Obama could use "the target air".
At least she was disappeared between the White House and Assange's word shooting.
The American President Baracka Obamy, Robert Gibbs, called it "comfortable and absurd", that Assange requested the ministerial officer Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently published spionary calls to diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we're interesting about a person with web pages," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more significant than his websites."
The American Government now investigates the security of its databases.
The Special Confirmation was called Director of the Centre for Anti-Terroristic measures, Russell Travers, shared the White House.
Travers was responsible for the development of "necessary reform in the structural" which are required after the publication of reports on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the way the whole government changes and protects information.
The Government also announced that he wanted to take care of disidents and activists if they should be in danger because of the publication of Wikileaks.
"We've got everything to get to contact them," said the speaker of the Ministry of Phil Crowley.
"We're ready to protect it, but if it's necessary."
University of Smzlin
At the "Gelato University" in Bolon are prepared for the better year-time sugars.
Basic curses for the future struggle, which remains three days, is great interest and visitors come out of the world.
Where's that crazy?
With Gelatire and Gelataio.
Gelitarier, a little bit of a smoking, produces a crown according to all rules of the Italian corruption science.
Gelataio leads a smoke out of the kidnapping box, shoots it into the box and sells it.
To find this, you don't have to lead to the Anzola of Emilia in the Province of Bolón.
But whoever wants to learn more about death, he will not be "Glato-University" of the Italian Carpigiani company.
In 2003, the manufacturer established the universe's universe in order to respond to the high Italian ideals.
Basic course for the future Gelatiri, which remains three days, is a large interest and visitors come out of the world.
However, there are also some day-specific cups on chocolate disturbation and practical practices in their own smoking.
Somebody uses in his Midlife-Crisis after a new carrier, others look at the dark rain of his worst threats.
This time is 40 participants from 19 countries of all worldwide - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a teacher of science from California, loves Slow-Food and wants to offer a quality European product in the industrial Ice-Cream country.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and she wants to start something own after years of stressing work.
Two young Egyptians dream that they're opened in Kair.
One man in Malta and one of the Brazilians want to improve the quality of the dead in their bars - and the Canadian woman in the house of Julia came because her children love the Italian smoking.
Maestro-Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of perfect destruction.
The decision is not only a good poverty, but also a happiness and a good conscience.
Luciano will not forget during his school on a south-and-law-law-shirt-shirt, "Italian Gelato is easier to be the best - and then there is still a noted dose of romantics."
The first step of production seems to be a simple.
Luciano sets the basic jurisdictions of milk, skin, melting, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which all appears to the electronic program at 85 degrees, and follows immediately to four degrees.
Then it turns to the wood machine and exceeds the pasterised white basic crowd, based on all kinds of milk struggles.
Immediately, percent of the questions are injured: Is it possible to produce a smoke only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment himself?
Luciano warns that he should be unknown.
Who's talking about "one of natural trials", of course, has used stabilisators - most natural products, such as guarantee of guarantees.
Of course, it may be possible to produce a smoke and without stabilisators, but it must sell for a day, otherwise it is shameful and the legacy is selfish.
Certain variation of basic substances are allowed.
It's better to drink with aromatic existences.
Maestro Luciano differs in the poverty of destruction according to the threshold that is buyed in the supermarket or in separation with fruit or division of graciousness.
Besides, there are traces and crowns.
"The additives will try to inject a lot of aromatic causes."
"You should have been a simpler experiment."
Be with fruits with sugar and fat fruit.
Or it is broken from the white basic flowers that will change the vessels to the yellow crowd and the cake based on all the chocolate trials.
Now it's going to take party curses to crash machines.
Luciano is always allowed to produce four different types of vanillic, chocolate, coffee and lie - or with birds or without them, with more or less vanillic aromatic or other natural thresholds.
The same experiment will also be carried out with the fruitful species of destruction.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pearls - in view of pain, it is not always better.
The smoking of the lyrics do not need to poverty more orphans when it contains more smokes.
Increasingly increasing disturbation from the kiwi produces a group that uses more fruit, less water and less stabilisator.
Before the exhaustion of the smile, it's Luciano.
The manufacturing of the smoking is clearly a number of tasks: If broadcast pearls are used with a lot of sugar, the sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
There's no need for extra sugar portal in citrons.
Luciano produces a device that defines the contents of sugar in the fruit (the winter measures the brain of the grain).
The happiness tables reduce the numbers.
The production of deadlines is no longer required so many body measures as before.
It does not only help the device for the automatic production of basic substances.
There is also a equipment that is prepared for the preparation of the commutation currently placed in the crowd and driving at the minimum of the temperature.
And over all the automatization, we don't have a little disease.
Brazílian Gustavo will suffer himself and also his colleagues to the bottom of fruits when he is cut out of the control of a large mixer.
"In every curse," Maestro Luciano says, "it's only a question of time when something is going to happen."
Revisions in double light
The European Food Agency of Efsa is carried out with the industry that experiences genetic plants.
This accusation has now published a group of experts of testbiotes, which is considered an independent institution for biotechnology results.
"It seems like a symptomical theory, but we did it well," he said in the middle of the Michel Testbiote of Christoph then.
Leading Ephs expert groups for genetically changed growth, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa's officer has a number of years of contracts with his lobbyists of Ilsi.
This is financed concerts as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in the decision-making way of Ephs control rules for genetic plants and there is so in the clear area of interest, criticizes then.
The provisions of Efsa are complied with all paragraphs with the documents of Ilsi and are not such a manufacturer of the industrie that should be controlled by the Office of the Italian Party.
It's the second thing that testbiotes advertises on the thirty of interests.
The high manager from Ephs recently passed without addition or transitional time to the Switzerland Agriculture Concern Syngent - and changed the pages.
In addition to the Middle Germany (MDR), the EU's recent personal connection for the control of industrial lobby, which has contributed to the interests as the Ministry for Environment, as well as the EU's elders.
Ephs can't recognize the threat of interests.
It works with all serial data, therefore, as well as those of the industry, if highly high quality, is indicated in one statement.
The experts who work for Ephs are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But he needs to add them.
Kuiper accepts its work for the International Life Science Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is also marked as a neutral forum of experts from science, industrie and policy, except for the risk of biotechnology without a lobby contract.
Independent experts like then criticize that they are in the present time allowed genotechnically changed plants in animals without any trial of carm and that the reactions of genetic plants on the environment.
"We want to know what it's doing, for example, genetically changed cookers in the field," says.
The current practice is only to test isolated white carbons and not all the genetic roses, which do not have the results of the corresponding results.
"If they don't look for risks, how could they find them?", said he, "If they're not going to find them."
With that agreement and Angelika Hilbeck.
The Scientific Worker studies a gentleman since 1994 and currently works at the Technical High School in Curry.
In this area, the industry is tried as in the United States, and now in Europe is still more influenced or discussing critical scientists.
Therefore, though there are no scientists who would not be connected to the concert.
Most are not published studies for critical companies.
"Industrie controls security research," says Hilbeck.
Stone rate
Out of Gsell also ordered a few, about about 400 kilograms.
On Monday, I stayed before traveling in Stuttgart, the tube on the back.
She was a demonstration.
It's hungry.
The story is known: In September, the baggers came and began keeping a large north steel.
The world in Stuttgart was not the same: thousands demonstrated against S21, billion reduction.
When the statement has been stopped, most of them laughed in the bottoms.
Dead in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Vapence from Crailsheim, a mixed throat stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a shooter in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He made a few of these cows.
"These stones are reliable."
"He can't lose."
"A lonely and poor stone, simple and properly."
When one split, he died after the cigarette.
What's going on to do with these kitchens, you don't know.
The stones have time.
Get out of Gsell too.
The stones of Stuttgart leads to the forest in Tübingen to the old deposit of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his rock rose.
The 44-year man's business with old stones.
He buyed all that occurred during the bottom in Stuttgart.
"It would be a damn thing if they were thinking about the wheel or lost on the deposit," says in his office, a tree bus that was before a rent house.
He says that they were overseating him and worried him when in September in all the newspapers he was buying the rest of the North Clock from the company that leads the demolici.
But he spoke all the days with S-21.
And he explained them that he couldn't even be a democracy.
And when it happens, then it's the most smartest when stones continue to use.
Then, 200 S-21-prohibitors took each one at least 80 kilogram hard block, price for 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some are also in hope that they will return him to the rebuilding.
Rongen buyed 500 tons, cost 25 big cost cars.
Maybe half is still in the forest, and the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardens, country gardens, households.
They came out of all the cats and departed what happened to the coffee and the story.
The sport stones of Stuttgart have been changed for a long time in "shirts" or as the border of the branches.
"This stone really is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't that political instruction."
He's sitting in his territory car and walking on the travel after his 20-year hectare kingdom.
He studied before the law, he stopped the study, after the biologist, then he was interested in the computer and finally became a stone trader.
And the lover of stones.
He's saved 40,000 tons of stones.
He takes his costs from all Germany.
He says he's the biggest businessman with old stones in the Republic.
It's crazy.
In the shadow, it's artificially operated pigs.
"They were looking at Marien-most in the Trigerians," says.
The lab's sticker, the yellow, the dark, it's surprised.
"My favorite stone."
Let's go up through the woods.
It shows the crowd: Red pizzle, first part of the cart in Karlsruhe.
Next.
"The heavy travert."
One time, these coffees were in the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
All in the dream are stones and story, Cannsstat-travers from the police presidency in Stuttgart, red border from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tub from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What kind of work, like a ship, what a pool.
When Rongen thinks how the stones were struck hands and transported by simple steams and smoking loads, it will be entirely killed.
"It would have been scanning if something's going to do."
He wasn't rich, very rich anymore.
Today, the trainer of stones is 14 people, and in addition to the top of the forests set stones, one shooter, one shooter, one shooter, one shooter and one garden.
"We work hardly, but it's nice," says he who evaluates the rest.
At the same time, he needs to go to Colina.
They'll also save stones there.
High-potencial talents war
There's a lot of people in the division.
16 students are pressed by the breads with the lake, the rackets and the smells.
Technical University in Braunschweig and Volkswagen car producers invited the architecture students and design on workshop.
Commonly with VW company developers here, they have to talk about the future cars and just to meet Volkswagen.
Many firms are trying to achieve the most clearest head, such as the VW company, receiving and exploiting cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: What can be rejected first in the most recent obedient absences, even before they arrive on the work market and they will be interested in others.
Since universities don't give a list of successful lists of their students, companies are trying to find exceptional talents in projects on the practice and get them.
On the TU Braunschweig, the car concert is trying to get talents on the second day.
One young lady from a person's division divides properties, gomes and sticks with the VW log.
Reports the hope of young talents about practices, students' employment programs and indicates their ways to concert.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig will be a project together with VW.
They see the costs for both sides: "The students will be contacted with the industry and get experiences."
"WW can actually meet students, close to meet the interesting candidates and think who would be a collaborator."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, they're not normal.
But the news is that he's so openly fighting for students.
"Inak was almost a good project," says Selle.
The battle of a fair absolver will probably be stronger.
In many sectors, companies can't choose their jobs from the long-term travellers.
He must try and try to touch particularly highly qualified work forces.
Firstly, the ingenerary officers have an excellent excellent exhibition position.
According to the data of the German VDI ingegners, 40,000 ingegner positions remained in August.
And according to the proposal of VDI, etc., the absence of injectors is still raised.
For the auditory and advisory company, KMG's Roman Dykta is on the talent lot.
Manages ancient Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern rate on the base where the participants should find a path according to GPS coordinate.
The company plans the next year to send these eight promised students to the United States.
The participants can also look at the KMG fields and contact the company.
It will be decided in two choices to participate.
Only Créme de la Crème from a lot of lunch interesters to the United States.
In the High Potencial Court of Universities, Dykty will continue to pay more important laws.
"We want to separate our Race from the others."
"It was a lot of lot for us."
It seems that Dykta's talents' love has happy.
"We stayed in contact with all participants of similar action in the past year."
"Some people will quickly finish the study and plan to get out of work," says.
In addition to the right exploitation on the campus, the small and central companies are classically present on the markets of work.
"We're trying to contact absolvency on good exhibitions."
"Come to Intersolar," says Sitha Stube, leader of the manufacturer of Solar World Solar Technics.
The company of Bonna works around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows the problems with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are written on Internet sites.
"In the present time, it's just comfortable to contain a free place."
"They're a lot of time and money," says.
Another opportunity is contacting professors on universities.
Solarworld cooperates with different high schools, such as a university in Freeberg.
"Professors tell us that we can do practice or write diplomatic work."
Solar specialist doesn't match any dear reklame action.
Instead of this, the company is trying to love other costs: personal atmosphere, low hierarchie and easy communication.
"The great concerts often can't offer it," says Stybe's leader.
In search of work, the money is no longer to play the main role.
Flexibil work time, attention of children or good options of the process are more decisional factors.
Solarworld contained in one study of the Great Place Institute, work 55, place between 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute establishs a list of the best German employees.
Furthermore, cooperators are asked how they are satisfied with their work and work environment and monitoring the framework conditions of the employees.
The Leader of the Stube's personal section hopes that the location brings its points to the interests of the workers.
"I think the interesters are particularly informed of the external employer's potential assessment," says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from German Employment Branding Academy advises firms who want to build a long-term strategy of good news as employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentics.
And according to Mr. Krieglera, this means especially internal measures.
"The best way to visit as an attorney employer leads through its own employment," says.
The internal employee Branding is well called, therefore, the employee on the market in the framework of own employees.
"The pleasure of the employees are the best expenses."
When the company is good about their people and they're identifying with the company, then they're going to make a record of their employees between friends and friends.
"It's like a game with a league," says Kriegler.
Both stops new branches
During the following years, Florida will not be disappeared before the north of the United States of the United States in Mexico.
The Government in Washington gave the corresponding command, and it was interrupted with the final fulfillment of the previous plans.
Also before the Atlantic borders, new branches are denied.
The Ministry inside Ken Salazar shared it in the middle.
The cause of the command that should pay at least the following five years is the explosion on the deepwater Horizon branch in April.
Before this disgrace, which was the eleven of life employees and led to the largest environmental katastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama signed on the ozone and the industry of his earlier, to allow new flowers in the east part of the Mexican Agreement.
The residents are trying to reduce the United States' consensus in additives of strangers.
Today, it is not clearly explained whose responsibility is responsible for the destruction of the olive pool in the ground.
In the middle of crisis, the British Energy Concern BP, which is confronted with billion requirements.
The Research Commission that Obama trusted should submit the results during December.
In October, the Ministry in Ken Salazar interrupted the command of the explosion.
Recently, there were various concerts of the requests for a new favourable purpose.
Obama and Salazar want to refuse similar catastrophes with more precise controls and strict security rules.
In the present time, the control authorities are mainly reformed by many corruption obligations.
Obama now announced that the lucrative options of the charges for the railway and plot concerns can be removed.
The industry is now openly advertising that the more relevant regulation is essentially reduced to the weight of weaknesses.
"The Government Plans are the largest rate for the growth of the flow and low industry," says the result of the current investigation in the consultation of the BDO advisory company - still before the investment in the middle.
American Energy Alliance still threatens the instance in the field, "Nobody knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investment into new hard projects will be achieved until the revoking is increased.
The area of Ogoni was scattered
The water in the rivers is wounding of oil, it is like in the pumps: billion litres of uncle ropes have destroyed the nature in the area of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People are living by the crowd, the corruption and the illegal weakness of rocks.
Celestine Akpobari thinks good.
"Netrapte yourself," rejoices the ecological activist journalists: "Those you will be achieved before the objective is still a huge garden."
The 37-year-old Nigerianian attempted to photograph the boys that are smoothed by the water, which covers the smokes: this scene is driving in the water woods with smooth colors almost even to be beautiful.
It's not to see that under the top of the plane of the wounds of the rocks, not to see.
Before she was gathered in the garden's equipment, she reported Esther Badom on the border of the Bodo-Jetty River.
At least, it's been a smoking water completely dead.
Five years ago, there was a large floor area from the exploitation of a large quantity of plants.
The fishermen of the remote town of Bodo must spend at least six hours to get into the water where fisheries are: the area of Ogoni, which is in the heart of the Niger River, is one of the most dead areas in the world.
Restaurant after the river of Manrovian bathrooms with a lot of sides is first known the entire range of running.
The engine on the member is struggling in place of light waters, and whoever puts his hand into the water, the oil sticks.
The roots of manroids are cut out of the land as a black pitch of medicine, and the sticks of the palms are allowed to see their letters hardly.
We're looking for the heavy birds that are usually shown in the large areas: When a striking engine on the article, it will be discussed in the previous paradise where it will be cutting like pumps, scared silence.
"What happens here is an environmental leadership of war," says Celestine Akpobari, "we live in a constant fear of health."
Confrontation with war is right.
The area of Ogoni is a bite field where a few decades are fighting: for more than 60 years, first residents in Europe have been replaced here in the 80s, there was the first chair with the later replaced writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Concern of Shell had to stop its production in 1993 because it was a very dangerous business.
In addition to the region of Ogoni, the company is not able to return: while the whole party area of the Switzerland is a three-size of more than 5000 branches and 7000 km leads more than two million of black gold barles, it is laid down the round field in the area of Ogoni lads, for the concerns, this situation is instabilable.
Each hundred meters are covered from the water of the oil construction as a bizarre socks: "Vanna trees", so they call very much the heads of the fair crews.
They're 50 years old, most of them are rejected.
Every moment, the head of such a fair opening, says Akpobari, and then the constant smoke of the water is exhausted.
According to the defense of the experts, more than two billions of litres for 50 years were exposed to the ecologist: each year the quantity of eggs, which were explored into the sea in Aljashki at the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" in 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in the history of mankind.
They take the sports who are still responsible for continued ecological diseases.
While the Concern Shell marks sabotage and organized raws for more than 90 per cent of pollution, the environmental protection of the grounds of animals and non-good leaders as the main cause.
Shell requires a lot of smaller security rules in Nigeria than in the world normal, the concern in 2008 American scientist Richard Steiner: Only a lot of smoking on the waters is "increasingly higher than any."
In the place that seems like a department, an oil covered under the wide sky, it comes out of the grounds: they are completely narrow and even after the oil.
Under one of many sugars that are partly connected by the leaders, partly freely separated through the land, the fire: illegal small rafinery.
The robbery is in the court over the fire a few hours, explains Michael, the leadership.
Before the leads to the locked benzine, then the hair to the end of the cherosin and the end of the nafta.
This way Michael and his four co-operators will produce each day to four judges after 300 litres: "We'll make so 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The resident party use the chronic losses of flood plants in the largest black African country.
Nigeria's own only one rafineri.
Increasingly low price of 40 cents of euros for litres of nafts, the illegal manufacturers can still survive: because they have a survey weakened.
It comes from the "bunkers" who are driving in the field of Ogoni: according to experts, it is so in the entire area of the Niger River Niger lost the country at least 16 million literary.
But only a small part of the provisional surveys are illegally suffered: the largest part of the entire organizated criminal network that they have to be a policy and the high position of the representatives of the army, to the tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debatte, whether the katastrophe of the citizens and their principles or the lax form of production, considers the activist of Akpobari as a clean academic.
"If they wouldn't have considered the worst society for a shooter, and if they wouldn't destroy the live basis of fishermen, then it would not be sabotage, none of the shooter, nor of the illegal rafiner."
In the meantime, the relationship of Ogoni in particular to Shell is so deceived that it seems to be just a concert's department: "That may be other nations as Chinese as better."
Michael's nice.
"The highest time to lose," says the famous manufacturer.
"Any moment they can come to the soldiers."
If she found them a special military unit, they don't hurt prison, but a painful payment.
Moreover, the soldiers who go from the north country - as all the Nigerians - want to benefit from the surveys.
"A lot of crazy thing has received our land in all views until the day," says Akpobari.
Researchers found a dangerous staff error in A380 engines
A380 has obviously a great security rate.
The investigators discovered the machine that has recently arrived, a potential stability error that could bring to the "catastrophical accident of the engine".
The air company Qantas wants to invite the engine manufacturers.
The Qantas airbus was obviously more happier than yet known by the Qantas Airport at the start of November: the Australian Air Security Authority detected at its steady-security evacuation on A380 engines - and now warns the possible establishable error.
Perhaps it should have difficult consequences: on one oil connection, the markets could be exceeded because of the consumption, including this quarter in the public declaration of the ATSB Agency.
This reality could be carried out to "the catastrophical accident of the engine".
It's one of the engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series.
In the middle of them, there is also a Qantas company airbus that had to be accompanied in Singapur on 4 November.
The Australian air company has now undertaken legal steps against the British producer of Turbine.
The commitment to the Australian Social Court of Sydney has been granted, which allows further legal measures against this company.
The Boss of Qantas Alan Joyce said that his company would ask a disappointment for accident at the beginning of November.
During the motor fire, the parts were released, and they were cut off the neckboards.
Rolls-Royce marked for the cause of the wounding oil.
After this event, it must be changed throughout the world to 40 motors.
Australian investigators announced that further safety tests with aircrafts are built by relevant motors.
Security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB Martin Dolan.
Security debt was considered sufficiently important for all of them to be informed.
After the noise of the Machine Qantas left the airport company for a few weeks on the land.
Singapur Airlines left three of his 11 A380 over the land.
Lufthansa has changed one A380 engine as security measures.
The two-parent airport is the biggest personal airport in the world.
The total degradation of the caos will be choiced in the preparation
Germany entirely in white: Almost in the whole country over the night.
On a lot of powers, the ships and the aircraft are moved.
At least three people died in transport diseases.
In the midnight of Germany: Having the whole Republic falled on the night on the fourth night at the dream temperatures - which leads to a lot of places to the caos.
At the north and east, there is 15 centimeters of snow at some places.
On several remote and many forces are strongly limited to the right.
At A7, Flensburg, a motor service was still in the steering, but it was not controlled by a new snow.
It was still a strong wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Community Office for the boat and hydrophography (BSH) waits on the Baltic Sea border in Slesvik-Holštenski, the finally built in the water status of 1,2 meters above the normal.
Snow conclusions have made significant problems in Sasca on remote and State motors.
Thus, according to the bad meteomedia centers, the rate of plots in Saudi Switzerland was the most highest grade.
From the part, 30 centimeters of the new snow, powerful and smooth winds have been struggled.
In the night, there remained a number of customers and personal cars.
In Saskou-Anhalts, the police officers have also reported a great challenge on the forces.
A2 caused the wind and the snow of a small driver and snow.
In Durynca there were difficulties because of the snow of A4 and A9.
According to German roads, there is a large problem in Saskou, Saskou-Anhalts, Duryns and North Bavors.
The main problems are snow on snows, transformed trees on rows or disappointed above guidance and exhibitions.
In Sasca, a lot of training was stopped from Lips to Norimber.
In the During Saalfeld, one ICE had to stop to Mnichova.
165 travelers received in the bowl of ships and safeguards of decks, food and drinks.
Snow wind war over the street.
In the large German aircraft, many years of sky winds were broken.
According to the speaking centres for the year-time information has already been spoken from Mnichova annually.
In Frankfurt to Mohan, Fraport spoke 40 years ago.
The maintenance of the motor is in an unexpected position.

Deutsche Bank seeks a purchase for travel-to-doses
Deutsche Bank wants to interpret with its signs: According to one newspaper, the bank seeks a buy bank for two officers in the main office in Frankfurt.

Thursday thousands for dead horns
More than 10,000 people took the memories of the new Zealand story, which were spoken for dead after several explosions in the bottom.
It was still not possible to save the dead, because the safe situation is still complicated in the sheet.
Anyway two weeks ago, the city of Greymouth came to a strong explosion in Pike River Mine.
29 horses in the age from 17 to 62 were cut down.
In the shoot where it came to difference, she was launched, but she didn't show any steps for life.
Since the high concentration of food plants and the following explosions could not be able to achieve safe forces.
After the second powerful detonation, the offices and experts went out of the fact that the tops have no opportunity to survive.
We couldn't even save the dead.
Now they worshiped the memories of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the south of New Zealand, ten thousand people were gathered for a suntime.
It's two minutes.
At the dedication of the pitched mountains, 29 tables were established, on them helms, lights and names of the tops.
Even images and personal things, such as clothing and surface skins found their place.
In the government buildings, the hairs of the balls were half of the grounds.
The New Zealand hoped that the tops will go out of the "great country" on the ground, he said to the participants the reminders of the Ministry President of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't be disappointed to his son until he saw his death, Lawry Drew, whose son of Zen was punished down.
Reminder actions were also participated, except the Ministerial President and Parent victims.
During the explosion of November 19, the British and South Africans were also arrested.
The safeguards started shooting fire inside the southern town of New Zealand.
While the eating flowers will begin with the smoking of high temperatures within the bottom, the police journalists, President Gary Knowles, said to the police journalists.
In the hell, warners!
Is it the horse for a lovely kitchen?
Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to reach the old border with his fight epost "Walhalla Rising".
What public thought of the Danish Register Nicolas Winding Refn when he touched "Walhalla Rising"?
The occupied Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be delivered from his muscles and in a great way they kill almost with the superborn force of their adversaries - it seems perfectly for young men's divines who seek blood actions, because our hero helps the cross of murdering methods and his enemies even inside of the weapons of life when he is bad.
On the other hand, the One, as it is actually called, does not say a word or a word during the whole movie, and also the other situations are leaving up to one or two winds, or let them be struck to the continuous dead exclamation.
Otherwise, it's lying and smoking in a very beautiful Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The movie is ideal as well as for adult surveys, the interests of existence and very quiet cameras.
It's good when he has more target groups, it's only worried when they're out of each other.
Regisher Winding Refn, after having touched his divine and stylised trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered as a Danish Reviser Quentin Tarantina, but stotically shocked, so that his work would be closer to more humor to the main dealers or less brutal to the loved public.
Most of the artificials of the artificial purchases, of course, allows all the smoking brain and inside.
The assembly of action films will be united later in the moment when a single is released from freely clear reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships to Jerusalem and will remain invisible forever in unfortunately and illness before, of course, fulfillment of manship in America and there continue.
So it's not amazing that in Germany, "Walhalla Rising" wasn't achieved in the kitchen and now was only given on the DVD.
It's principally threatened because of beautiful packs, but also because it's a fasadian person, locations to a collective blood, covers a respiratory chine that served a little attention.
In this film, it's not about the dialogue or the exact story, everything is an atmosphere, a horrible dream that became a movie.
And it's not for a weird effort.
Refn doesn't take him even a moment of freedom, and I will smooth him with his souls with his smokes and a dark hypnotical sound track, especially but unpopulable hate that passes from the heart's position.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One, leaves something as innocent, all the others are committed to evil.
From all the most unique heroes, which the motives never explain, which will be time for enemies and translators of war from hell, may be the sending of the devil.
Maybe it's a defense, but it's only for those who are able to do it.
"Walhalla Rising" is an essential film that can be happy and amazing, for disappointment, disappointment and amazing.
Shooter.
Incidental ground work
The IAEA nuclear energy Agency has a new advertising on the secret nuclear programme in Siria.
But the earth's branch of expressions, and it's not allowing controls.
At the midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israelian battle aircraft F-15 I of the fourth building in Siria.
They stand on the border of Euphrat; the largest city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Agency for nuclear energy (IAEA), its name is shown when it is addressed to the reactor, which was fully established by the Siria with the North Korea in this fourth of the field covered from the field.
Based on the reporting of the US-American Secret Services of the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the neighborhood of El-Kibar, was well occupied on the production of plutonian - of which it is possible to establish nuclear weapons.
The technology of 50 years doesn't matter anything else.
The CIA presented videos with non-contained satellite images.
The computer animation has explained where the components of the reactor could be before the destruction should be taken into a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
Furthermore, there were still photographs that showed the build of near or even outside.
Reactor was a short time before the launching, but still without a pivot article.
Today, after more than three years after bombing, it doesn't know much more than this time, even the threat has increased in time.
The last US President George W. Bush recently published that the CIA was very sure that Syria was built in el Kibar reactor, but, basically, there was no basis that the "active nuclear weapons" program was found in the country.
Some reporting secret services in Europe are still more careful and talking about the "unanimous reactor", even though CIA representatives are considered "valuable".
They have no clear evidence, like IAEA.
When he asked how he was sure he had a reactor before himself, he replied in the United Nations high diplomat in the year, the IAEA has a "materiality reaching questions."
In fact, "unused military buildings" was the Syrians quickly declined and also equipped the territory.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team was found under the leader of Olli Heinonen, an el-Kibar of the Uran, which was produced to people.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite photographs of satellite commercial vessels from a period of time after a attack that should be higher than those presented by the CIA.
They are not in the market, because they were exclusively buying an unknown lawyer - perhaps Israel.
IAEA therefore cannot confirm their rights.
The series always stated that she had never had a secret nuclear program and didn't make a reactor.
Uran goes out of the Israeli weapons, and Damashek appeared.
But it made the IAEA after the party analysis.
From that time Damashek refuses to discuss things - like satellites.
Furthermore, he invited the auditors to the second inspection in el Kibar and access to the broken buildings.
But the Israelites also are lying.
"We will never comment it," confirmed recently the official statement in that time by the Governing Premier Ehud Olmert.
The monitoring of this case is taking into account since June 2008 and the "reaching to a serious problem in regard to the confidentiality of the Agency" as a high-west diploma in the IAEA Section in Vienna, however, a serious agreement on the mandate of nuclear weapons regarding the IAEA.
IAEA considers the key to proceed in matters of three other devices to be "in functional connection" with a given reactor - and there are still a variety from it.
The reviewers therefore have not taken later, nor any of which devices are taken, nor any function or why they are understood.
According to the news of Southausche Zeitung, IAEA is internally marked as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images complex buildings, which probably is one of the surprised objects.
Of course, inside or in the middle nearest of military bases, it is clearly rejected by this reason the IAEA access to these three areas.
In Vienna, the Syrians were afraid of fishing expedition - that it would be IAEA before sending the United States to scatter military bases.
The nuclear detectives were notified on the United States secret service device.
IAEA has also the bases and satellite pictures that the material was transported between these three and fourth places in Euphrates.
In Vienny, the highest west diplomat said that at least one of the offices should be "in conformity with the production of pipes."
But there are no "no evidence of sensitive activities", therefore on the promotion of uran and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is started by an urban that is not protected.
But where the uran is coming and where it should be spread a plutonium to the bomb, these central questions have only the probable disagreements.
It is also not known whether the tracks that could hide the important pieces are held on these three places.
Jacobs have gone out of the ground of hundred costs of costs of cars, no one seems to have any information where it has gone.
Only several kilometers from el-Kibar remote and on the other side of Euphrates, a soldier department of al-Tibni, which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable cost for radioactive department, considers IIAEA as unprobable.
The last IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley gave him to be convinced with a reactor in one satellite analysis for the renamed magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the pictures of the universe show that after the IAEA requested access, Siriah made the Serian on all suspicious locations of the country's work and removed large continents.
It was possible to act about the agreement, but it was not helped to explain the subject.
Furthermore, the diplomatic crowds say that the IAEA has produced a number of months of the plans for auditors that would allow Siriah to keep an accidental military secret - only the wall shows how great it is for the auditors.
The Damashog did not reject this proposal.
While western diplomates were still calm in Vidni that they were still destroyed, and that is why it doesn't fall, there are a few months of the United States Glyn Davies, including special inspections, which is one of the most valid instruments who have the Vienna Nuclear Office on the Prosecution.
Boss IAEA Yukiya Amano, who should suggest an inspection, has already spoken about "the possibilities that are in the future clone", yet he is weak.
This option takes a great risk: On one hand, most of the Governing Council of IAEA needs and many of 35 countries invested have no decision for sculpture.
On the other hand, how one advertises, "What will happen if they finally find nothing?"
Love during war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on still unnamed regulatory privileges, there were difficulties.
She wrote the scenario himself, it is about a favorite story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbska.
It doesn't know much more about it, but it doesn't make it quiet.
It is tried to say that the woman who is a Muslim is loved during the war in Yugoslavia to a brain man who hated her.
Bosen women's communities were protested immediately, so they moved rapidly planned attacks from Sarajeva to Hungary.
The movie was attracted in Hungary and it's in the postproduction, but in Bosenska is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women War victims writes through UN-Organisation for UNHCR Jolie's support and requested a meeting with heritage, reported now the Bosnia news - Jolie is also a major United Nations organization for the aid.
It's not just diplomatic - she offered women a week ago in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting has to go to Bosna, said Hasecic.
In the campech where it was deceived, the loving storys were deceived, and Jolie’s positions with the victim are exceeding a lot of scenarios.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN-organization to help the officers to leave Jolie as a big-slankin, reports Guardian.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bossen Ministry of Culture, which has received to read its scenario, allowed the smaller inhabitants in Saraje’s attainment - not clearly, then why Jolie didn't even get.
The young author believes that in his film there is no political thoughts that with great effort conflict in Yugoslavia, he wants to show the terrible consequences of wars and all participated parties to give space.
With regard to the contents, it remains increasing.
On the Internet, there is another version of a movie that seems really different: lovers have already known before the beginning of the war and again, when she is as a boss' muslim locked into the silver room where he serves as a guarder.
It really seems to be a lot of other than "the sacrifice of humility is loved to his mutter."
The fact that the movie Jolie really begins before war is true.
Jolie says that it's a pressure on her that's "no failure and is based on wrong information."
Now they can save her already the hectares from Hollywood: Thus, publishing illegally on the internet of her scenario, how many times they have done it.

"No emoticment," says and drinks just a drink.
"Goodbye, it seems to be worried."
"Let's just call it a lonely department, completely easier, with some friends, a few drinks, a few here."
Regular practice democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America grows, as well as the support of private business.
Loyalty activities exaltes greater fear than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influenced than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer investigation, which was held in 18 countries and exclusively in the The Economist magazine.
Since the investigation is regularly completed since 1995, it may so monitor the changes in the positions, for instance, the whole area.
In the air investigation held in September and at the beginning of October, two relevant matters are referred to.
The first of them is that the Latin America has a nice joy.
The second is to increase the stability of positions directly to democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries on the Pacific border in South America has increased explicitly (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth in average of 6% from 2002, the support of the democracy increased at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also grows in Mexico, where the economy was repeated after the depth of production in the long-term year.
But only half of the questions in Mexico and Brazil, two major areas, are democratics, which loads regional average (see graph 2).
For instance, 44% of the responsibility of the entire area has expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in their country, it is the same number as in the long-term year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it has been amounted to 25%, it is a great growth (paragraph 3).
Throughout 34%, they believed to sleep in their country and 45% trusts the Government, reacts to the same numbers as in the past year, but it is a big difference in comparison with 2003 (17% and 24%).
10 years ago, the democracy in Latin America has submitted the economic crisis.
The support has increased during the world’s financial crisis, probably because of the reason that many Latin American countries have suffered only a short receipt and have been satisfied with a strong survival.
In addition to this stronger social security network, the poor people helped protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the level of Latin Americans who live in poverty has increased in 2009 only in comparison with 32% in this year.)
But it changes in a wide spectrum from the ground to the ground (see graph 4.)
The strong economic exercise of Brazil and the popularity of her departing President Luize Inácia Luly da Silvy is turned into the width accepted meaning for progress.
This situation is greater in Mexico and Central America, where the review was seriously serious and has increased the status of violent criminal acts.
First of the second time when the investigation was started to carry out, more answers, for example, Latin America as the most important problem of criminality less than the unemployment (see graph 5.)
The range of 31% says that they or their neighborhoods have become themselves or their neighborhoods in the long-term year of criminal activity, but this is a cutting in comparison with 38% data from the past year and is also the low number since 1995.
The massive economic effort is reduced in a growth support for private business and marketing: approximately 71% of the respondents, for example, says that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% from 2007 (see graph 6).
Almost 58% agrees that the market economy is the only system that allows to develop their country, this percentage increased from 47% from the past year.
It is interesting that 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (a 80% there supports private business), although their left president Hugo Chávez provides many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has leadership in the area as mentioned 19% of the responsibility (in contrast to 18% in the long-term year), follows the United States (9%, reaching the long-term year without changes) and Venezuela (9%, increased 11% in the lone year)
However, the United States are considered the most influenced countries in Mexico and in the largest part of Central America, including Venezuela is happy to succeed in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nikaragui.
Critical Options
Nobody expected that the general options on Haiti would be perfect on 28 November.
But they were much worse than strangers who try to help the ground to fear.
Options of fulfillment and repeating voting, voting letters distributed by channels, broken choice rooms and fears.
The choice rooms opened after hours later.
Many Haitians, including many moved by the cause of the aircraft, stood around and tried to find where they could go.
Some of them finally gave it.
More than ten President candidates, including some pre-planned pre-advertisers cried out that it was about the shipping and called the election after discarding.
Protestans, some of them, were broken throughout the earth.
Although Edmond Mulet, the High Officer of the United Nations on Haiti, announced that "in many regards he had done a very good choice."
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean community said, "It does not believe that these inequalities, as a matter of serious, have not needed to interrupt the process."
Other words, show continues.
The electional authority which the opposition votes are carried out to Rene Preval, the non-published president and his candidate Judae Celestino, shall notify the previous results on 7 December.
The expected decision-making seed is planned on the ship.
All choice hopes are not lost.
Two former opposition candidates Michel Martelly, Raper and Mirlande Manigat, first lady, departed from their original calls to be proclaimed for an invalid vote.
However, if Mr. Celestin, who has a small or unnecessary support between the electoral, will be marked by the election committee because he has received the decision-making sovereignty.
For the order of choler epidemies and more than 1 million people who still lived after landscape still in states, they were concerned that the choice participation would be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization they had been denied.
Over 250 thousand evidence of identity that are necessary to vote have remained shortly before the choices were not distributed.
There's a lot in the restaurant.
The donors see the election of legitimate and popular governments as a fundamental step in the rebuilding Haiti.
And then it's clear that the Haitians's principles themselves.
Points to the center
In the weeks when she was raised it, Christian Fernández, Argentina president, from public sympathy when her population was sent from 20 to 50%, the highest level of the time she was chosen in 2007.
However, the conversion of this success in a successful campaign for the second functional period in choices in the next year may be concluded whether Mrs. Fernández is incompatible with the incompatibility of his married husband, the president and the political partner of Nestora Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be raised up.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in the economic policy and after his wife had successfully been president, had a general meeting of the budgets that adjusted payments, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose another reception for the library.
The Government of Mrs. Fernandez was lost in the majority of the Congress in a lone year.
But the obsession was divided and was continued destabilised when Mr. Kirchner died on 27 October.
Some members of the Government of Pernist's political threat were added to Mrs. Fernandez.
But after chaotical meetings (which has been made to fack and accusation of the government from corruption), the Congress could not apply the budget for 2011.
"I'm not agreed to come," said the President.
The budget for 2010 will also be paid for the next year, and the President will have more space to lose for the living.
Economic is exceedingly gained: a yearly growth is likely to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private disasters and employers are talking about the numbers that are close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who held up to the Office in 2003 when Argentina followed the economic collars, established priority for the growth and reduction of poverty, often than the control of inflation.
He refused to interfere with MMF, encouraged the private sector and cleaned INDEC, the statistical Agency, which has approached to monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can the President Fernandez die this policy now?
She called to act between private businesses and departments.
And her officers say that they want to limit growth to 18% in the next year.
Economic was supported by the growth of world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
However, inflation has broken the growth based on a large devalence in 2002.
That may be the reason why Mrs. Fernandez gives you to know that he wants to renew the argentin finance in the rest of the world.
By the beginning of the air year, the Government established a agreement with the holders of the debts who refused to restructuring the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Mrs. Fernandez's Agreement with credible governments who are companied in the Paris club with $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always stayed on that reality doesn't have the MMF view of how normal it is.
But last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economic, announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to be proposed by a new national consumer-price index, which will remind the implementation of INDEC cleaning.
It is not clear if Mrs. Fernandez will want to stay in the policy after the end of the functional time when the husband is not on her side.
If you want to stay, you need to get the support of the central class that is unlawful Kirchnerism.
At the return of Argentina from the air-limited air, which they have in March, will be completely raised.
If he wants to play more choices, it will be necessary to decide whether the silence is not necessary to consider many opinions that her husband remained in political policy.
Polar rehabilitation for China
Taiwan's choices are closer to useful connection with the firm.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother over the sea?
More than 7,5 miles of volators, 70% of the rights, called on 27 November, the cities in five cities, which may be considered as a larger evaluation of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma Self is the representative of the feelings that are firmly controlled and have strong positions in business relations, including the Agreement on party of free circumstance, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma went through a trial, but it's just quiet.
Although its side Kuomintang (KMT) ended the challenge of three of the five old offices, she was not able to play a major voice.
According to the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is attached to the largest independence of Taiwan, has obtained at least 50% all votes against 45% of the CMT.
If the President's choice would be concerned, the President Ma should have difficulties.
Since the election was chosen two years ago, he shared the voices of his side in about 8%.
First was the DPP side with KMT in cities.
Options were gathered as a major majority of Taiwan choices that include deep choice cars and mass collection with hairs with one of the girls vested.
The party was even a secret trial of attention.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chana, the Honor President of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates in the pre-selection.
A man shooted the younger Mr. Lien purely through his face, killed him and killed a stranger.
Weapon was not determined whether the weapon had to hurt Mr. Lien or compare the sport with the candidate.
In each case, Tsai Ing-wen, DPP leader, says that the shooting affects the choices, the DPP falls and brings the phone direct to KMT.
Maybe the only big campaign was China.
It was aware of how she remained in the background of a question of self-controlled.
Instead of the candidate, they have plans on the State's building and the establishment of workplaces.
Taiwan usually uses his fact of independence and hates the military graves of China.
So the KMT needs to move the trends to fix the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also declined from the rebuilding of anti-Chinese positions.
It's a reaction to the fact and recognize that the Chinese trade has a fundamental significance for the Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for most Taiwan.
From the government in Beijing, you can expect that it will continue to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategies to return Taiwan to the flock.
China has not lost the time when sending outcome to Taipei to order the summits for the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would like to see political integration, but on the other hand.
It will be better waiting for the elections of the President in 2012.
In each case, the DPP page appeared to himself.
Two years ago, she was on a bad level: her old leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison based on corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a smoker and remains clear independence.
But under the leader of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation that is dead and the DPP is hardly working for officers and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate to the President, such as Su Tseng-chang, who stayed under Mr. Chenn.
Their side is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs. Tsai published plans for research institutions that serve as a contact place between DPP and China, for the purpose of that their action may be done without previous conditions.
Mrs. Tsai communicate the Taiwan publicity that its side represents "a confidential alternative" to the active access of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be disappointed by this meeting.
In the statement issued from its target, he stated that the DPP candidates would be better if they continued to have Taiwan's own country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a plegmatic, that he wouldn't condemn the president.
But without the principle of Mr. Chena, the DPP will fight with the election between potential candidates.
KMT is authorised to search for own people.
The evaluation of Mr. Ma was bad, and it was also over the excessive time of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign.
His unbelievableness seems to be based in particular on unemployedness and increasing propaganda between the rich and the poor.
The KMT speaker says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as the local pockets.
The strongly proposed proposals for Taiwan's support for friends' advocacy are limited.
Currently, most Taiwan citizens consider the economic integration with China as unresolved.
According to Antonia Chianga, the prominent publicism, "body, from which it's not returned, has already been declined."
Nomination on the Price Grammy: Jazzo singing Esperanza Spalding is surprised in the category of the best new art
The commitment to the President's request and the people have to take care of the law.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-year-old-based base and song that President Obama chose to get up the Nobel prices for peace in 2009, is marked as one of the surprising prices Grammy in this year with nomination in the category of the best new art.
Considering that Spalding was a glorious position on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album went out "Esperanza", came a little late, but it is in accordance with the regulations of Grammy, when the artist should not give more than three albums before "the public identity of the given artist is established."
Her ambitional album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" was sure recorded a step forward and thanks to its unfortunate vocal style and a white hand with elements of pope, fun, and Latin influence, we can talk about Spalding as the success that in 2003 recorded Norah Jones, the nearest equivalent for the voting in Grammy, which looks for the similar work in this category last year.
One porthy Grammy's right appreciates the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of the instrumental alba, which was a lonely favorite carrier in the lone year.
Iyer will conspire against the album of the test saxofonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and the keyboard John Beasley's "Positoots".
Trombone Shorty, a famous favorite from New Orleans and a frequency host in HBO "Treme" was evaluated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise cloned by Stanley Clark albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The divine group of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society of the steamunk has received a number of obvious recognitions in the category of large files, when in the concurrency was a comor jazz Childs Ensemble and still devoted Dave Holland, whose living album with the "Pathways" has created a beautiful example, as it could have a based free hand as a captain.

The planned massage in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned massage in Temecule has received a unique support for the local planning Commission for more than five hours often a public witness.
Criticals thought that the project propagates the terrorism and will lead to the shipment of trade.
However, the poverty decided about the middle night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be statistically useful.
"More good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews who you remember," said Nael, the President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, on fourth morning.
"I'm very honorable for this as an American citizen."
"It begins that righteousness will always win."
"Ozocice is minimum."
"They who are against, only cry out."
"We have really great people in our field."
The training began in six hours of evening and was at least north, when most of the time had taken discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were distributed equally, expressed Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the websites of news.
"America doesn't exist anymore," she found a comment.
"We're the Planet Opic Opic Planet Socho's freedom has fallen into a song."
"American clothes."
The planned Islamic Centre also called protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the tragedy location, which occurred on 11 September 2001, when the terrorism in New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush, the violence was denied.
His religious object that was reading nearly 135 families was used in Riverside County for years without incident, but he was more and more appropriate space than the stock space that he had spoken together with the manufacturer of the filter systems.
The new mixture of 24 943 square steps in the middle sea architecture will also have two minerals and grow up to 43 feet.
She should be killed instead of 4,32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three miles east from Chaparral High School.
The proposals of the project can still be invited to the town Council.
Mixers with difference against the Arena increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or anywhere
The scope of a similar battery that can use the Arzen as one of its lives, increases space to search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly further.
Researchs have discovered the unnormal battery here on Earth and say that it is the sign that life has the possibilities that are standing outside the main elements that were still considered and based.
"This body has two capacity."
"He can grow by the phosphur or the aeron."
"This reality is very special, but it is not exactly that it's a form of a real form of 'mimother' life," commented this fact Paul C. W. Davies from Arizona State University, along with the author of the report that occurred in September on the website of the Science magazine.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - air, water, hair, cycle, phosphor and cyre.
However, scientists discovered that the battery found in Mono Lake in California are able to continue to grow after the art is replaced by phosfor.
"He's starting to see you what everything is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, a partner of the report.
This neighbor is significant to search for life outside Earth, because the researcher must be able to recognize life and know how life can look like, said Anbar.
The study is focused on the microbs found on Earth.
However, the report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which had not discussed the detailed detail, called a wide speculation on the Internet that the report refuses the revelation of the external life.
It's not that.
The inventory "declares that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that start biochemies and that the sale of elements that we consider as "normal" should not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, British.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is innormal because the replacement of one element shows other elements in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," adds Cockell.
It wasn't a pleasant nazi.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who carried the study, was involved in Mono Lake because she shows a high hungry of aeron.
Arzen and fosfor are chemically very similar elements, so it thought that microb, which is established by both elements, can be able to replace one to another.
"Arzen is mainly eating because his chemical behavior is very similar to fosfor."
"The result is that organs can be very hard to separate these elements from themselves."
"But the art is so different that it doesn't work as fosfor. When it gets to the body, it's starting to work in biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
The scientists gather the battery known as GFAJ-1 and make them a growing concentration of aeron which are able to adapt and grow.
Mixtures grow better in the use of fosfore, but, as they can also survive with the surrounded aeron, increases the possibility that the form of life that uses the arts can appear naturally, and it is only on Earth or on another planet or month where the arsen is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a beautiful microbiology assistent at the University of Florida, announced that the thought of the aeron that could be replaced by fosfor is not a new, but never found a example on which this fact would prove.
Arzen was most common in the past times on earth, and the scientists especulated that they could use her former forms of life.
"This means that they could be different ways to create life, not only by the way he was created in the morning time of the earth," said Foster, which was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simon.
Research was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute
The remaining robbery of dogs were found in Compton
The rest of two of the four exhibition dogs that somebody stole from the Bellflower Motel were found. He reported about the sheriff of Los Angeles at fourth.
Four exhibition psi - two activities and big pembroke corgis - lost in the outer, when someone robbed Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they traveled night at the Bellflower 6 Motel.
Two dogs were discovered in the middle of the morning and two dogs left in the middle of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, a police division for Los Angeles.
"Good news is that dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in a good state."
"They were delivered to their legal officers."
Whitmore refused to say where exactly the dogs were found, in which locality, he did not share the details about their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We keep the rules."
Leaders of dogs, Christina Rickard and David Peek, weren't arrested to tell them about the case.
They had a great joy when they found in the middle of the middle of their two actions in Downney.
Sheriff's leaders found van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Activity Trace, 3-year-old dog Trace and 10 months didi fenomen, were without disappointment.
But Bunny and Peter, the name of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had to participate in the plan of this week of areas in their names of Japanese leaders, remained not found until they were discovered later in the middle.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are this week in the city to participate in AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they had to show Trace.
Other dogs had to be joined in other challenges planned in days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said Peek the Times in the middle.
South California is only one stay for a month traveling a couple after exhibitions.
On Monday, Peek and Rickard registered in the mobile.
Sometimes they're over in the mobile and park their car before the room window.
They also took three dogs - boxer shirt, Parson Russell territory and the Bretanian field - who stayed with them in the mobile room.
Acity and Pembroke Welsh Corgis left in the car where they had to be hungry.
A little time they opened the window to have a dog in the car to get a lot of light air.
Peek and Rickard reported the car in six hours in the morning in the field.
Peek said that he offers a reward to anyone who brings them to the lost dogs, and the dogs have implanted microchips to their identifying.
In the fourth, it wasn't clear if the prices were made.
Lev is ready to explore now when the MGM restructuring is reached from the Court of Final Approval
After 18 months of fire and immorality, the MGM company has finally received green to restart.
The Federal Insolvency Court of New York officially welcomed the "forward balanced" plan of creditors to equate about $5 billion and to clean the way for 86 years of the old beauty company that is interested in the production and production of films and TV shows.
The fourth extent that the plan is fulfiling the requirements of the United States competitive arrangements do not remain any legal reviews to restart the Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum based on the main guidelines of this study.
The number of employees is 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM is not identified in Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase is not agreed on the planned financial resources allowed by 500 million dollars to finance new operations and MGM production.
Now it is about the connection to the investment bank that is required by 75 million dollars and financing is expected around half December.
The restructuring process started in May 2009 when Moelis & Co was the most investment bank to advise the management of how to resolve its financials, because the management was fighting to allow the payment of the payments for $300 million each year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-general director of the company of Enron and a representative to reject his work known for Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Coopera trials to resolve MGM financial difficulties and 140 creditors had been longer than they were expected.
After a few months, the parties agreed that they gave a company to selling at the end of 2009.
Although the auckers attached a few interesters, no one of them was able to pay 2 billion dollars more finances that required trusters.
At the airplane, everything was returned to the aircraft, and the MGM team began to work on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal accidents, it was finally the plan of trusters in the end of October.
When MGM in the next weeks is officially raised from the competition, Moelise and Coopera will receive their job for multi-hamilion bonuses in dollars.
Moelis & Co., which has already received 1,2 million dollars, will receive $9,5 million.
Coopero's companies who inquire for their services that leads to the company, 375,000 dollars per month, gets a reward for success, such as "success fee" 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew the production in MGM that only carried out one film in this year and offered a proposal for seven or eight films that will be exposed at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan to finance two films, which will offer the book "Hobit", and that's together with Warner Bros.
The study needs a special payment between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share in these two films that will reorganize Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, whose own 18% of MGM was looking for an opportunity to serve a study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he was the greatest operator.
However, recent operations between both society have not been made in the agreement.
Technological games that keep your payment in the equations
The leading candidate of the air year is the most weird iPad game that follows the video horse system. In both cases, it is one of the explicit steps to pay payment.
Think that for the price of one iPad you can buy five cols BMX for 99 dollars and one game Kinect is the same as 10 coral sports or about 48 miles Play-Doh.
But there is a way to maintain your payment for payments in equality.
I recently visited three national sales player - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and looked at what electronic games I can buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; the aircraft technological games have more energy, and that's in the same prices, not about something low, in comparison with the past years.
While the relatively less new games with composed web, two most known games of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin are offered more.
The number of players with bottom battery, as a player with battery.
There are some recommendations.
(All those prices are from Toys "R" Us, except cases that are designed otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years) are a lying animal that can sing when you press them a bitch.
On one pressure, the animal gives tone and the second press will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmonically.
Note: When you start mapping, you can't stop.
The best choice of singing and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60$, from 2 years)
Last year, I ran on Elmo Live technology with 14 palc animators, which can play the game Simon Says, and also knows the monthly course thanks to his innovative clothes with locking the cold.
Children test Mickey's tane teacher, although their parents are able to lose sound control.
If you are a child of 80, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educators.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playcool, 40$, for children from 3 years), with a entire full-term card that is proposed to turn into work with a self-free, funny worksheet.
If you smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the most simple variety, with the keys of the keyboard, although the games do not have such effective exemption as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of Leapster's line from Leafrog, with the new and clearer discretion.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce her and e-book and has a slot on SD card that allows to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a five-year-old file that is not larger than a boxer from the hair, each of them has the LED display.
The goal is to create words by locating the cook in order before the exceeding time; it is great for the comfort in the improvised creation of the word.
Still more player has at least some kind of online connection.
In the highest way, two webkinz games and Club Penguin were attached in games.
If you want your child to buy a online game from Club Penguin, you can choose Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains mines with hidden code.
When you activate online code, your child will get the credit resources in the Club Penguin area for two free items.
That could be the need for cool brussels or Puffle's animal.
A little bigger than the heritage of your dark card is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years), most of the microrobs on the bottom battery.
Brouk is moved quickly on 12 vibrant silicon feet in the appropriate dimension.
It's happy when you're doing a smoke out of the cock and see if he's going to find the way out.
He's too very delicious.
Ours was able to fall out of the kitchen table and get some time on our dog's thrown.
Industrial policy control in China
As a citizen military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked on the subject, just controlled his commands and delivered commands with the military authority.
He wanted the women's members - the chinese ships of the city's order, feared and opposed for their suspicious steps and violence - to concentrate a certain accommodation on the depth of the colds.
"Stay up right!"
"Come on!"
Show them, "How a beautiful girl!"
Four very young girls in the white hands and the same oil boxes and challenges were focused on.
Four couples of black bottles are sorted as a line.
Four heads are perfectly sitting on hairs that are perfectly blue and white shoes.
"I'm sure they're looking at the middle," said Mr. Tang.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government tried to survive the image of cities in China.
One city was established to have the new branches of high school education.
The Province Guangdong has changed the seed-year uniforms to more additive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced severe views for strong weapons: in 2009, the report was reported that 50 officers were inadequately covered the car with their owners and seen certainly at the owner, while the lunch sold a half-hour and went away.
Xindu, the town period of 680 000 people in Chengdu have chosen the operation for the main image.
Since 2003, his city police was fulfilled by 13 women who were specifically chosen according to their view, conformity and younger age.
The goal is to show out except the heavy sides of the police, too smaller, women's side.
The only Scarlett Johansson should be difficult to get into the secret Chinese town groups.
They would argue critics for a good reason.
In the absence of the police, these policies are only allowed to make a city explanation, to save reviews and other administrative positions.
However, the Chinese communicating means usually achieve different reality.
In January 2008, the policy inspectors of Hubei Province devoted an independent divine to die after he used his mobile to achieve how they start in the case of protest against the steady.
In the long-term year, the police school in Beijing, the manual for this school was robbed and located on the Internet. In the manual, there was another description how effectively to deny the truster without blood.
This year, a driving businessman in Shanghai came to the ship with five polices and suffered the left part of the brain.
One video game is full of violence that you can download on the Internet shows Chinese polices as struggles on the pool soldiers.
"Chengwan has excited the government," China Daily, national education, called in the lonely year after another debate on taktics.
On the paper stood "Really cleaning."
The Scientists say that this isn't enough.
After the time he inserted in January, in the interest of eight new women's police, Leader The Beijing Evening News asked whether women have real obligations or are only separated.
The answer seems to be a little bit.
The period required women's age from 18 to 22 years with a good position and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adepts should have higher than the average - so higher than 1,6 meters.
The service of 26 years is obligated.
The functioners say that the work is psychically too worthy for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one named cop on Rednet.com, like government websites.
"The candidates must first show out the external quality that then determine another, belongs to the height, wheel, face charts, etc.."
Then it comes to a series of consciences and "inside quality".
Women are like flowers, and he said, "Besides that they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, director of the periodic city, does not agree with this description.
But he understood that the requirements on the height are also common for other work positions in China, and it will be at both heads.
Like the requirement for the relative characters of the face.
This means that the question of good consideration is between China's subject to discuss.
Health or destruction are sure not valid.
"You can't allow us to serve a crown or hungry man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who looks at Baoguang's theme near the clergy, has 22 years old, faces like a jabble and just smoking mouth.
She doesn't think she could have sexy race on her look, she said.
"Do you think I'm looking sex in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic view.
She's a co-operator with balls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is representing the town's image."
They don't have anxiety against their limited execution, they said, because their carriers are greater than only to start businessers in the street where they can do their activities.
Each morning is a group against more than ten markets who offer cups or rolls and are trying to sell the most boxes and topics before they are disappeared.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you so many times," said Mrs. Xu, when he began to escape the market, and at the time he left his rock with the car with the nudge.
Policists describe their responsibilities as more monotonic than obtained.
"Every day it goes on the same basis," said Huang Jing, 20 students in his free marketing.
"A lot of rutin."
One of the reasons is that women's polices have no powers as their men's shoes to buy the goods of the soldiers.
They can only make sure that they are given reality to report to their man's leader.
The tendency is then to protect them from the excursions of public enemies against the official parrate which are normally in the framework of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the main city of Yunnan, have built up after the false news about that the police killed the sale.
More than ten police agents or police officers were broken in night hours; 14 government vehicles were transformed or burned.
The Xindu is still uniformed by such violence.
But calm can be handled only on the road.
Only two blocks from the rest of the Baoguang team, where the morning the police had watched, were gathered over 50 people on the road of the street.
Policists have cut off the motorcycle that was moved to the passenger inside the vessels as they require provisions.
The road leader could weep as he wanted.
15 minutes from the police, faced with the steel, with lots against vehicles and quickly go with the motociccle and his owner.
Le Juedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the man's group, remained behind, his white design turned to hide his name.
Like women's policies, the coordinators are men over 40 years who have only aid role.
In different ways, they are not trained in maintenance and inflation of images.
"It's sometimes we fight in vain."
"It's sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li.
"The most is the publicity that begins with it."
Procurators will not commit Senator Ensign
The Procurators of the Ministry of Justice pursued Senator John Ensign from the criminal offence that was concerned with his ancient advice for the campaign and his efforts to ensure the lobbys, announced in the middle of the senator's lawyer.
The decision ends the most important legal grave, which Mr. Ensign, the non-Addian Republic, was, and who was, at the time of the scenario, was considered as a potential candidate for the President for 2012, and his affairs came to national titles and sent his carrier.
The Office of Mr. Ensign said that it was the decision that had been followed at least after a yearly investigation, "assuredly consolidated."
The senator would still be able to achieve a disciple management at the Ethical Commission of the Senat.
Mr. Ensign's employers said that the Ministry of Justice "We informed that Senator Ensign will not have any objective of investigation and that it is not in the plan to make any further accusation in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has refused to express it.
The decision was surprised for many ethical lawyers beside the Ministry of Justice, which declared that there were severe evidence that Mr. Ensign prepared for the prohibition of the federal lobby.
Talks, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times showed that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to ensure the lucrative lobbys that had been led to smoking Mr. Hampton and his wives, Cynthia, on the sensoral relationship with her.
Ms. Hampton's time worked as a bunker in Ensign camp.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and support their opinions after Mr. Hampton worked for them, so many documents and conversations.
Since Hampton was the recent assistant of Mr. Ensign, he was from the law of his old employee or Senat for a year excluded from the lobbying of his old employee.
The officers on the label say that the unnormal order of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were before friends, appeared in contrast with the lobby law.
From the evidence that were published "the fact that it was a clear case of preparing the law to delay the law," stated Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who is specialised on the protection of customers who are investigators.
While the Ministers of Justice refused to explain the reasons of the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr Brand, and other lawyers with specialization on the label said that the Ministry is careful for political requirements, after a great number of accidents, including the decision to stop the request against the ex-semenant Ted Stevens, a center of the violation of the State Affairment.
Federal officers "smartly hidden the weapons," said Melanie Sloan, the Executive Director of the Organization for responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), the advocate group that had given in these cases several stresss against Mr. Ensign.
"It shows that the government officers do not apply the laws," added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Mr. Ensign, in the discussion he called him the State Deputy Minister of Justice on the Sunday, and then on the second day, and told him that the Ministry didn't seek any accusation against his client.
Mr. Ensign's maintenance team cooperates with the prisoner in the attempting to convince it is that the senator, as his office repeated in the central statement, "the one is in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to excuse the legal arguments that he had submitted to the State leaders.
"I'm not happy to discuss my detail with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they have done a right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation of the self-control, in which the Ethics Group provides a statement that the payment of the parents of Ensign Hampton for the 96,000 dollars has made the federal election law.
The election Commission said that there was no evidence to demonstrate that money had not signed anything other than a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton to find a lobbyist job was the NV Energy company, the main unadditional company that supported a long-term senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started in the company as a lobbyist, leader of Mr. Ensign - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that "bushil" was to the Ministry's internal issue.
Mr Ensign also participated with Mr. Hampton and other non-advanced clients, Allgiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to attend a meeting in the name of the air company after Mr. Hampton on the lobby work.
When the last year was first discovered the report of the April, Mr. Ensign was forgiven his voters and rejected his function, as in the quarter-republic leadership in Senat.
After a number of months, Mr. Ensign shared reporters two weeks ago that it is planning to participate in the third election period in Senat.
In the report, Mr. Ensign is no longer the purpose of investigation of the criminal action of his speaker Jennifer Cooper, that the senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and ends the whole investigation.
"Senator Ensign is happy to continue in his courageous work in the name of the non-advanced people," she said further.
Cheshire calls on Twitter
In the rows of the judicial side, the half of them wrote.
A minute after a minute, they sent reports about several witnesses through Twitter.
Finally, the refugee says that more than 140,000 reports on Twitter have been raised by distressing and advocating children to bed in the house that was burned.
On Friday, Steven J. Hayes was condemned by murdering three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and had been fulfilled with the saving of death's trespass, which was voted.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already submitted the court to call on requests and arguments that the court probably would have been employed for years.
One of the most productives is that the intensive reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter main reporters - has created "circus atmosphere" and this is expanded, directly declining information with detailed detailed afterwards, have made a report in the meaning of the view of publicity.
This proposal could be approved by the judge to question whether the new technology should also require new rules in the court.
"How I live in this translation, I think there are real dangers that the locking of new technologies in the court side affects the rights of the righteous process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main officer of Mr. Hayes.
The Court of the Procedure Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State rejected the statement on the expenditure of the past week and that the media were "increasingly controlled" and that there were no evidence that would be demonstrated that the participation had acted under the influence of publicity.
But it's probably not about the last word in this case.
Through the decades, the courts recognised that the reporting of nottorically known cases could choose questions about the justice of the process.
In the Court Regulation from 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States denied the jurisdiction of the cleveland chiropratic, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision, that, in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, he was in the process of the media's cause of carneval atmosphere.
Some are convinced that this criminal act was an inspiring TV show and a movie "Upchleck".
Some lawyers said that the challenges of the judges of Hayes were examined about half a century later, they could be surprised by the argument that it might be necessary for new rules that determine the way of communication directly from the court network, which was insufficient in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
John J. Donohue III, legal professor Stanford Law School, who studied death crime in Connecticut and wrote the report that was made freely.
Professor Donohue pointed out that some judges may be aware that the restrictions of direct communication directly from the courts are more justified.
The event of Twitter is only one of the many injured lawyers Mr. Hayes who would have been able to argument years to keep the execution of the judgment.
In the case of Mr. Hayes, the Court of Blue rejected him to test the reactions of potential portfolios in order to show them a criminal photo of the grid when the election of the mood is selected.
Some of the fathers told them that they were scared by the photographs of the victim Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter of Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The officers also claim that the crime of death is denied and said that the judge was wrongly rejected the port that was critical against the State holders, and that his decision has not raised a greater pressure on the currency and directed the rate to think about the week.
The porots weren't divided.
But their arguments on the impact of the process may be the greatest interest.
They have been carried out in contrast to the currency of the past month that the case has reported in Connecticut and had been discussed during the election campaign of candidates on the Government and the Secretary-General of the United States.
They argued that the communicating media had not permanently reflected emoticons in the case of this case.
"The day he took the media, camera and reporters before the court," wrote the lawyer, "It was something that was not still in New Haven yet to see, and it might also be about the public railure."
Their purposes for Twitter's implementation are contrary.
In the discussion, some newspapers stated that the immediate report was more vulnerable than the reports mentioned later, and the Court of Justice should guide the fields of the capacity of other processes.
However, some lawyers required a call of courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adjustment of courts.
Mr. Hayes' employees are in charge of this law.
In their archives, the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 was refered to Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the breeding process process, and they wanted to explain the requirements that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "the case Sheppard versus Maxwell on the 21th century."
Can the creation perform the propaganda?
After the campaign, which was observed by its seriousness and negativism, this week, in Washington, a small number of creation.
Is this the first influence of the real cooperation of two political parties or only an illusion moment before the rapid return to the strange battle in the main city?
The extent action of the President Obama and the Parliament's leaders has not taken a fundamental statement on the basic subjects that should be implemented during the meeting.
In each case, it had been addressed to the creation of discussions relating to consideration divisions of two parties, such as the definition of their common responsibilities, often than the other empty episode of the party.
The central public meeting of the Deficit Deficit Commission was also civilized and also through political differences which remain between members.
It seems to be clear that the near capacity has built a respect with each other, which moves the ideal propaganda, which is still divided by the members.
And it's very easy to say that she started a new collaboration.
Both parties are now in experimental periods - they sold the marks of collegiality and compromise, as well as trying to assess the limits of public measures and the volatile patience in respect of the renewed party war.
It was therefore also an extraordinary action and its later evaluation of participants, which was carried out with the minimum requirements or accusation.
The philosophy differences between Obama and the Republic are too widely and too deep to propose the rapid change of the measures that rules here for the last two years.
Let's ask a question of donation, expenditure, health care or right, both sides are far away.
However, the November's choice was prepared for Washington at least quickly.
"No matter if the regulatory matter has changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's Administrator, now at Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are unresolved by choices.
The choices burned the emotions of the pages and then they escaped.
It's good."
In several questions, especially those who are going to attend meetings, have republished and democratic opportunity to find a solution.
The bus reduction of the data for the end of the year has been expired, and no one considers that it is worthy.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, and it is still or temporarily.
Like the probable compromise on the dose in unemployment only because the republished cannot look at how they support the reduction of the data for the employment, while they refuse unemployed support in unemployment.
After a remote operation in White House, it is already to see greater optimism on the possible agreements in these questions, together with the ratification of the new maintenance contract.
But William Galleston from the Brookings Institution notes that successful cooperation on fundamental questions will not be needed to take the relationship of two political parties when 112. Congress calls to air.
Of course, it's probably a period of accident, or even unresolved, he said.
"After what things are doing to do, psychology will return to one of the confrontation," he shared.
Wehner also expressed the skepticism, which is in significant way widely expanded - to bring a real cooperation.
"I'm looking at all the division between the present and 2012 as a branch box when the main events are in 2012," said.
The reasons in large regard are with the establishment of the new Republican majority in the White House and the choices of the Chess Feeds that helped to create it.
The Republican leaders now stand before the danger of the exploitation, know that they must keep according to their promises and reduce the costs of governments and decline the new law on health care.
These provisional lines are clear in initial reactions on the recommendation of the deficit covering the reform of the payment law and the increase of certain data, the increase of the cost age and the reduction of the expenditure.
The Communial President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles took themselves as a task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to their opinion, the pressure of the deficit to the public programme of ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18 member Commission to make their plans as official recommendations and then fight that they may be closer to this number.
The biggest contrast is between the elected officers in the field that suggest that in the case of financial questions, at least today, small bases or will for compromise.
Galston prevents two phases in battles between White House and Parliament's Republic.
The first year begins in the form of strange conflicts, when the Republics call Obama to resolve budget, data and health care, when there will be greater party cooperation.
What's going on to get up?
Public depression.
There are many evidence that most Americans want to still see two pages working together.
If it could be able to turn to the path, as it was in 1995, then both parties will be very close to monitor public reactions.
Anyone will worry to reduce the voice, it will probably change the curse and will look for compromiss.
This may be optimistic view of things.
Structure and orientation are today greater than half of the 19th years and shows that the greater ideological space between Obama and the Parliament's Republics has been created than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, the activities on both sides will see 2010 as a prevention for the most important choice in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the creature that occurred this week would be a great number of Americans.
But it will be a lot of chances on both sides to find common bases in questions that are still divided.
Expressed American document is the Moscow as a corruptor
The ruling of the city is in the hand of "cleptocokracy" and it continues to continue parts of the tables and banks for the protection that are coming to Kremlin, the American ambassade in Russia in the signs of February.
The police and the Federal Security Service in a large way keeps a protective body that helps to explain the high costs of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trades but also from organized criminal groups.
Each plane of burrocracy - whose Premier Vladimir Putin called "the vertical office" - takes his own when the money starts to get up to the top.
The record that was sent to Washington under the name of John Beyrle was published by WikiLeaks on their websites.
The register is based on the sources which the names were edited.
The record was written in the time he was an elderly Yuri Luzhkov and accused him from a large part of corruption.
He was called President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but from that time we can only monitor the minimum changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, whose own prominent constructive company, was still described of corruption in many years, and he won a number of requests for a crown accusation for such a rebellion.
In September, he said to the Russian TV station when he was held on the proof of corruption, "It's crazy, it's Spain, it's a consciousness."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is composed, it will be shown to vote.
However, it is usually increasing to meet such detailed in such a way, and it is in the ambassaded report, and it is also unbelievable to do the diplomates of stranger countries.
"The Government of the city of Moscow and its connection with criminal lives led some to call it 'disfunctional' and confirm that the government works more than the cleptmocracy than the government," says the report.
"Kriminal elements are joyful of the Criminal and Mafia world, which means "three" or protection), which provides to them the police, the federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry inside and the Office of the State Defence, as well as all in the Government of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics identified and accessible structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on the same top."
"Federal Security Service, Minister of Interior and Millies are at the second level."
"And finally, at the lower grades, it's normal crimes and investigation inspectors."
"It's an inactive system in which criminal groups fulfil the empty places in some areas, since there are no services offered."
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest company and the police are measured to smaller businesses.
One source said, "The owners of the trade in Moscow know that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry inside (reasoned from the organizated criminal groups) because they are not only more weapons, resources and powers than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is not so short."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, the protection of the self may already have difficulties; even those who pay may be arrested sometimes.
Those who don't pay enough quickly will close their business under various resources.
Medvedev sometimes spoke about battle with corruption, but allowed him to make a little progress.
The ambassaded report is talking about muscles of coffee, likely increasing preparations, to Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to join the burrocracy," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team of India.
"It's part of this burrocracy."
"No part of political classs, because there are no more political classes in Russia."
No policies, no opposition, no power, no corruption is unnecessary, he said.
Indonesia describes that the Russian corruption is more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country is located on 154 in the recent investigation on the global implementation of corruption of the non-governmental organization of Transparency International (the country is organised at least after the most investigated).
Receiving the reports of the American Ambassades, which appeared in Moscow until at the late evening hours, it certainly has not been invited to the Russian Government, although only in the meaning that Luzhkov can be offended for Kremlin, as to argument in the matters of the problem.
By CNN talking with Larry King, Putin declared that documents that WikiLeaks had published could be boxes and reacted to the statement that American diplomatics called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The right of all the matter is that it's about our own competence, which is the important factor of home policy in this country," said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think that it would be done with such an arrogant, with such a touch, you understand, so not ethically."
The Veterans of the Red Khmers are nucted to compare with the past
In the light-lighted beton students, he reminded the director of Anlong Veng High School, a man who made it, leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"All here love the Moka."
"He was a good leader and was looking for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
It is known as "shirt" for its sustainability during the Government of the Red Khmers, the governor remains in this remote holding of the Red Khmers in North Northern Cambodge, where he built hospitals, monkeys and other infrastructures and still lives thousands of old soldiers of this organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmer's remission of governments, it is a long-term loyality in Anlong Vengu.
In April, the victim was allowed to be confronted publicly with people who were part of the mode.
In June, the government offered students who first explain the history of the Red Khmers and their old soldiers.
And in July, the Court of the United Nations and Cambodge's First Court of the Former of Red Khmers, the judgment of some previous leader, nottorically known of the Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, the most known as the Spirit, to 35 years of prison.
With all such progress, he increased the disease between the Royal Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts of dismixation and their trials to reach into the Cambodia company.
"Besides the old Red Khmery, it's a lot and fear, but they're unable to do anything," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation center of Cambodji, an independent organization that tests the mode.
"For them was the life between the Red Khmery's beautiful, but the mode was a symbol of evil."
"He divides the family."
During the Government of the Red Khmers in Cambodge, from 1975 to 1979, 1,7 million people were prepared or died for hungers, sickness or transformation.
When the Vietnamians attacked and destroyed the Government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and his soldiers went up to Cambodish border with Thailand.
There they started the resurrection that remained until the last step in 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led party wars from their bases on mountains and jungles in the west Cambodge, while Ta Mok cultized stoupence in Anlong Vengu.
But in the midst of ninety years, after the peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic choice in 1993, and the large groups of the Red Khmers began to go over to the government that made the capital of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was taken by Government in the remote mountains of Dangrek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh's prison in 2006 during the expectation of the process.
Their mechanisms had no longer disappointed them, most of the old fighters of the Red Khmers were driving into the normal campaign foreign life, and many of them were nestly reminded of the time of smoking.
Although some of the Red Khmers have maintained their local government position for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unvaluable agricultors.
"These people had only minimum benefits from the capital," said Sok Leang from the Centre for justice and migration that leads a public forum throughout Cambodji, including Anlong Vengu.
"They're obscured by a autopic agricultural ideology of the mode."
"They were achieved without any suggestion of trade testing."
Sor Lim, 55, who came to the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, was fighting around Anlong Vengu before he was sitting as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmery was good," said.
"The Mock's all enjoyed."
"But now life's hard, because we've got to make sure all of us."
The judge of the Red Khmer also called fears.
At the beginning of the next year, the court begins to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another old Minister of Red Khmers.
The Court has a mandate to steal the leadership and people responsible for crime, but it was not said whether it would continue to continue in the four cases.
It was just a little to calm the fears in Anlong Venga.
The recent media speculation was focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a region leader in the provincies of Bantaya Meanchey during the rural Khmer government for the end of seventy years.
In 2007 she said to the researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodge that she had observed the trapeang Thma oversight, a project that probably was lost thousands of employees.
Last night, Im Cham returned from the work on the field to his tree house to the road path beside Anlong Veng.
As the sun started to meet and show the darks through broken trees, Im Cham refused to talk about his pastness between the Rude Khmery.
If he would call her the court, she would refuse to go.
"In Cambodge is peace and is stabil," she said.
"If they're going to find another crime, it's a war."
Premier Hun Sen, who passed from the Red Khmers in 1978, also advertised that it would come to unstability if the judge will look for further surprises, although the experts and history do not agree.
"The Cambodge has to buy a deep hole and buy in her past," said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodja needs to do for the moves before, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Smoking in the chemical dimension means the smoking of broken cows," he said.
"It's our obligation to give these crazy cups together to understand."
The center has made the first approved Government of the Red Khemerech, 75 pages, and the name of the "Democratic History of Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as a add to the teaching of the Ministerial History, which contains less than four pages of the Red Khmerech.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Venga knew only few details about the Red Khemerech, and through the connection of the city with the mode.
Touch Valeak, 19, student at the middle school in Anlong Veng said that the new student helps students to understand the important part of their history.
But his parents reacted sketchly when he took the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of school and courts," he said.
"They're subscribed because they're not sure how many people will shoot the judge."
Sok Leang says:
But the public forum, the teachers and the courts begin to have influences, he shared further.
The Red Khmers are still strong.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is the way of a growing plot and cut off the pitched plastic balls that leads to the pitcher of the black sass, covered with a pitched pitch.
The body of Pol Pota was burned here on the pneumatic sepulchre after his death in 1998.
Noah Sothea, 31, the carrier on the street border said that he didn't know much about the man who was burned in that place.
"But I have a strong spirit, many local people walk here and pray to him," she said.
The young Sothea had been birth and had to visit the location of Pota's rest in the plan later, where the wedding of the armies of the banans will bring her to happiness.
The Belarus agrees that its weapons are looking for uranum
In the surprising winning in the campaign of President Obamy, on the ensure of nuclear materials throughout the world, the White Government announced that their high-behaviour uranu is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The Agreement was published in the common declaration published after the safe assembly of the Ministerial Republic Hillary Rodham Clinton and the White Minister of Sergei Martynov.
The American government tried to convince the Belarus after years, to reach the high-beautiful uran and appeared that they were cutting on the rock of the smoke last year.
But the American officers said the Washington Post that in the past two months with the Belarus had been carried out a couple of forced operations to remove 187 books of weapons on the ground of the white research device.
This was prepared for the central agreement to remove the rest of the material - at least 500 library, according to the officer who spoke under anonymity conditions, because it is a civil interest.
The Agreement was shown to be one of the most important results of Obamo's national summit on nuclear security in April, on which Belarus was issued.
And it was, of course, a good tattoo to ensure the invitations of the Old Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated of the fact that they want a place for nuclear security 2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of Partnership for global security, groups supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called an agreement as "the very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Praia in April 2009 that he would ensure all the civil nuclear materials around the world for four years.
Since that time, the Government of the United States has helped six countries to rescue all its high-beautiful uranum.
Belarus will be seven.
Third countries did this for the management of George W. Bushe.
In the time of Obamo's nuclear security summit, the White President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his nation never appears to be his uran.
"We have high-beautiful uran - hundreds of kilograms of what is based on the weapons and less protected uran," said Lukašenko later.
"It's our coody, we don't decide to build shoe bombs and we're not going to sold it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, came to the United States for a few months ago, and gave a view to the adoption of the agreement.
The first commitment to remove the white uran in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily locked, reported the officers.
It was based on a special floor that traveled more than 1300 miles to Russian equipment for living and liquidation, said the officers.
The second operation was closed in the lunch and was held aeroplane, said the officers.
The United States Government for the Programme has lost 13 million dollars, most of that to add a white research system less vulnerable uran, which does not happen to the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was very strictly coordinated and held on the basis of confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Biniewski, the Ministerial Energy Director of Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study of nuclear weapons this year declared that the Belarus has at least 88 libs of uran used for the production of weapons.
The Belarus shall, according to the common declaration, encouraging the elimination of its procedures until 2012.
The reviews between the Belarus and the United States were cut down throughout the year, especially because of Lukashenk's crucial repression of human rights.
But the median statement indicates the possibility of progressive taxation.
"We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States and the Belarus have recognised that the most important maintenance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains based on improved relations and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its citizens," said.
Spanish government hasn't done the CIA dramatic years.
The Spanish Government did not dramatic about the CIA airports and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánam through the Spanish territory, as expressed in his United States Early Early Telegram in Madrid.
That is the result of the documents offered by the Wikileaks journal El País, where it also wrote that the Prime Minister Mary Teresa Fernández de la Vegova requested to be informed by the Spanish executive and "with so he could show that he had an important observation on aliens flying the Spanish airspace."
On June 2006, after the report of the European Council, which was committed to thousands of States, including Spain, to participate in the participation of human rights to disappear, a meeting between the majority of the United States Eduard Aguirre and Fernándezo de la Vego.
In addition, the premisher said that the European Council's report "the Safetar Government has taken from the game" and continued that Spain does not have anything to hide in this case.
De La Vegowa showed that Spain has no problem with years of secret services through his field.
"There are only to be informed," that they don't "stopped not ready," reports Aguirre in one of the documents.
Miguel Angel Moratinos also declared the American majority that the Spanish government wanted to give this question as possible less circumstances, however, since this thing was in the hand of the judges, the cabinet had limited influence.
In the year 2007, Vicente González declared Velvyslanectifi that, if it is concerned, the court does not want to block the initiative to request the national secret services documents (CNI) and the Ministry of the Ministry for CIA years.
"This information does not contain any increasing directory or any citizen information," explained Velvice-Slancty after talking with the Procurator.
However, the United States have expressed fears at least because" a clear coordination between the Spanish Court and the German Procurators" since the CNI or the Ministry's defence.
"This coordination between independent knowledge will complicate our efforts to resolve this case diskreetly between governments," says Aguirre.
In March 2007, at the opportunity for the celebration of the United States and the Ministry within Alfred Péreze Rubalcaby, this advice declared that "Which Spanish judges are very independent and do what they will be able to be able to do," adds to their cooperators, "to exceed the resolved comments with the meaning of reducing the return."
It also expresses its concerns on the action of political parties of the Partido Popular Party (PP; Czech Party of Lida - note.) in this case.
"And through its universal proamerical orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not want to use any signs that the Zapater Government has tolerated or has ignored the United States actions that could be interpreted as possible to interpret human rights, and even if it could have negative consequences for the Government of the United States."
The recognized mother's murderer was driving on the network on the mother's "storp"
The young woman talked about the child when she was dead, and she had her blog, "Teror after the galaxis."
Monica Juanatey Fernández is called "Muki".
With the survey that she had already used, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; both of the neighbors of Noah in La Coruña, from which a young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know women's importance life that the ABC journal rebuilds with the evidence of their family partners.
Thirty-year - year - old woman from Galicia entered into relationship with Ivan Tunezer in 1998.
They're coming together a year.
Soon after what happened, she discovered that she was hard.
He wanted to know if he was his newborn child, but his old friend never left DNA tests.
She found a new knowledge once.
Her election was Albert, a young man from the nearby city of Lousame.
Their use was a long time.
The little Cesar lives with them.
When the girl went to the Balear Island to look for a job, the little girl left with her partner who even came to her visit to Palmy for week.
However, from the contents of her communication, the relationship has disappeared.
In March 2008 he's alone at Minorce and wrote, "Alberto's somewhat confused that I've gone for work."
"When I told him this, it seems good to him, now he knows that he must be with a little day and he can't do what he wants."
Then he's talking about the sms report that she just got, "I want you to return this month or give me the address where I'm sending you a child."
He says, "If he doesn't like me to leave my mother, I will take him when I come back."
In May he says about her return to her home, "This week I'll go there, but I'm just holding up to 19, because 20. I have to go for the job, so I'm not going to come about this place."
He explains that if it's okay, we'll take your son to himself.
"He'll be with whom he's going to be, so with me, and I'll never be in life that I'll leave him with someone other than my mother," a serious purpose in respect of her bad relationships.
There's another article in July.
When the report is exposed, it is supposed that the child that has been achieved on the first day of this month and probably was killed 10.
"Cesar's on one side, but it's not on the other side."
"On one side he's with me, and he's all liked here, but on the other side he's going almost every day to school."
He's talking about the traveling on Mallorc.
"I'll go there to the fly school, so I'll take a little money for a lot."
Seventeenth health and stress.
"The big puss from Cesar who asks me when you come."

The people would get in Snimovn 4 cross and PSC (Socialist Side of Catalan - Known.) would lose 9 Mandates
with the results of the 28 November, the PP would have the main word on the advice in Larida, Tarragon and Barcelona.
After examining the increased votes and the number of tested messengers during recent autonomics options, the Catalan PP (Catalan side - Known.) has already given the presentation of all options to increase or no, its views are more positive than the number of votes in global options is usually one of such options.
In 2008, the catalans have received 610.473 votes in general options, while this number was only 316.222 in autonomic choices since 2006.
Last Wednesday, the PPC (Catalonia-Site) 384.091 voice.
If this higher tendency was maintained by the translation of votes from PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysis of this party were calculated that if the general choices were recognised, the PPC could have received 12 missions to reach 8, the CU page (Convergencia and the Union, the Czech Shoda and the Union) would also have 4 mandates (they have 10) and the PSC would have been reached at least 9 May 25 ( May 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan has a fundamental significance for PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Working Page).
According to this human analysis, the ERC (Lewis Republic of Catalan) would have lost one sentence - now there is 3 - while ICV (Green Initiatives in Catalan - note.) would have another mandate, even if it would have received another.
However, by the election Calendar, the nearest offering will be made in May 2011 in the opportunity of general elections, where people may also have a decision-making impact on the end of socialists in four major provincial cities and also on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputation de Barcelona), which is one of the administratives with the largest proposed budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
As nationalists, people agree that the PSC could lose the railway in Barcelona, Tarragon, Larida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain most of them and could not return to their traditional associations, ERC and ICV parties.
In view of the debat of the Republic, it would not be possible if this page lost its achievement in the Barcellona procedure - because it must be at least 5% of votes.
The PP side increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decision-wide influence in Barcelona, Larida and Tarragon.
Nationalists are convinced that they could achieve the main task in Turragon, where they were governing the PP side before the current ancient, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
in Larida, the PP was only 500 voices more than the PSC, whose elder Angel Ros has very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met in several opportunities.
The people also received other significant advices such as Badalon, Castelldelds or Reus.
In the present time, the PP has 34 additives in Catalan and would like to create candidates in the most possible areas.
Catalyst Cell offered the Al-Kaïda's organization thousands of passengers
Except seven arrested in Barcelona, three others were arrested in Thailand
Seven Pakistans and one Nigeriac, who were held by the General Information Communities in Barcelona, created a gigadistic cell arranged from Thailand, which made the travel passes of various Al-Kaida organization groups, including "Tygries of Liberation of Tamil Ilah" or "Lashkar-e-Thaiba", and the second named group was a author of agencies in Bombai, which were in 2008 for 106 persons.
The Ministry in the inner field is attached to the investigation of this matter a great significance, it is able to ensure the purpose of ensuring the "operation of Campaign" of the Al-Kaida's packaging at international level and "limit its operational capacity".
Researchers claim that this cell could be active for two years when Catalan was active, sending thousands of travel passengers to Thailand, where they were cut down and then added to groups that create the criminal galaxis of Al-Kaida organization, so that their "belovers" could directly travel through the borders of Europe and other west countries.
This distribution cell was not the only active network that had been in Europe, and therefore these investigations, except the Thailand services, participated in other European police units, and then cannot be excluded that in the following days, the European countries would not be able to be able to be able to be low, as the last in Barcelona.
In conformity with this operation (when Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) were occupied in Thailand, where the Pakistans of Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Hesan Butt and Thaijec Sirlaya Kijbumrung were taken.
They were just those men who led from Bancok's cell sitting in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalysis network, which was cut off in 2009, was cut down in particular to tourists the travel passes that had fulfilled the requirements of islamists.
This means that the documents had to be interested in men in 25 to 45 years, had to have validity for a few years and have been without a determined wine.
In the research documents, there is no fact that there is no fact that Catalan should be held with an attentive in Bombaji, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups who adopted the passes broken in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is noted that a few days before this attorney was sent from the Catalyst Transport Agency at about thousands of dollars who were "inserted" to buy carts to mobile phones, which later were used "command" members who killed 106 people.
The police's already missed a lot of evidence.
People's side (PP) requires after Mass to stop the fishing agreement
In the presidency of the PPC Party (Catalonia), Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity to present his conditions to Artur Mas yesterday, for which it would like to support it in the function of President Generality; these conditions are compliance with those proposed campaigns and their priority is the economic life and the declaration of the risk of business as an economic agreement as the nationalists wanted to provide in its maintenance.
The Chairman of the Catalysts was achieved to meet Artur Mas with a certain 18 sentency Christians received in choices from last week, which is more than the number of pleasant to reach the obstacles, then the candidate requires the CU to maintain at least one of the creation of the oceans to vote on its accession to the Office.
At the possible agreement with the PP, the future aliances that would like to keep nationalists in Snimov, while they will be fulfilled by the general choices, but the discussions that are leading in these days are not in the Catalan spirit.
If the President of the PP is in order to receive its support for the function, "It must be concluded with all highlighted and freedom statements," as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the Baskick - of which the chief CiU wanted even to vote in the reference.
Both leaders would like to travel the override political devices of autonomic management and to reduce the damage and donation.
The detail details about Masova referring to the function will be occupied in the framework of the Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met Joaquin Nadalem (PSC), who promised a serious opposition, Joan Hererou (ICV), and he is meeting with Joan Puigcercóm (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaridad Catalana).
The Director of the Geratric Device ensures that the death has not succeeded in the consequence of the "requiring measures"
The proposals of the Olot Centre do not say that their guarder killed more than 11 clients
The Geratic Centre of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered the pressing conference yesterday to exceed the excuse of the criminal behavior of Joan Vily Dilme, who - while he was employed - killed at least 11 elders who had been in the field.
The leader of this house for the elders of Joan Sala was achieved in the execution of the device lawyer, lawyer Joana Canadian, and announced that "the home of La Caritat would be able to bring a condemnation against wine" responsible for murder, however, "Legislation and responsibility are forced to stop this process to the competent officers."
In addition to the exciting of the good name that this institution can suffer because of the criminal activities of the guarder at the time, a great threat for the La Caritat houses presents the requirements for sustainable disagreements which have already calculated the legal leaders of the rest of the family.
Joan Vila Dilme admitted that his first crime was already in August 2009 and that he refused to kill from this time.
The judge urged the exhumacy of eight customers for seniors with aware that in many cases there was no dead doctor personally, but - in view of the age and the bad health situation of the patients - were all resolved by the phone.
La Caritat last night, through his director, rejected this country and rejected that "the rest of measures could not be in any case of what happened."
The right leader La Caritat added that "in the case there is no indices that any third person would allow a doubt."
A man who was overseased now "The Angel of Death" recognized yesterday 11 deaths and declared that the first crime was accepted on 29 August 2009 and on month and half later killed the second age.
In this case, death caused to carry out too high insulina doses, in the difference of the first case when he used the commutation of silent tablets.
Director La Caritat said that it is complicated to control personal access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail seditives were probably six cases of nine environments that he used to die patients in his ability to disturb them from suffering.
However, the analyzes that are now in the lab should show whether Vila could not and really look for his first victim less cruel death or killed them with a delight, as he already agreed in the case of three murdered women between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they don't believe the healthy proposal and don't believe that the number of killers can be higher than what he has been recognized and justify their conduct in various versions that Vila judged with knowledge that he must change his action when he appeared that he killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be the right to be available to clarify the entire range of this matter.
The European Central Bank is serious
Investors have reacted last night on the threat of the President of the European Central Bank of Trichet, which warned that "five should not be appreciated to react."
The area differences have been closed by strength and the action of the European bank has been cut over 5%.
However, we should not appreciate the capacity of the European Central Banks to discuss - the euro is just on a critical value.
That's what happened yesterday, it's typical for the unlimited market that, although it's going to be cut, it's repeated - but thanks to a short and very special position.
Investor's gonna stay for some time before he loses fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the peace of liquidity today, and tomorrow it will have to be revoked for two years.
The Bundesbank requested the end of the plan to solve a State duty for uneffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures during the period and to leave unlimited access only for a week.
After Irish crisis, we expect to prevent the peace of liquidity "minimally to March" and hold three months licentices with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee the liquidity at least to June.
We also hope that they will continue to continue in their Programme of purchase of debts and that they can even announce its intensity.
If it is not fulfilled by the expectation, it will create the reactions of markets from yesterday, and if they continue to continue in the load of liquidity, God will be with us!
It was the same at the meeting in May where they said that they didn't think of the purchase of the delegations, and it came to the market-- could be the story tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be faithful and reliable.
In May, she announced the pancerry growth in the lunch and in the middle of the fact that she had already buyed a lot of things that she had chosen to be more abusive market.
Yesterday, the exhibition of a year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro delivered only 500 million with 5,28% in comparison with 750 million with 4.81% of the previous steel.
Thus, however, in Portugal, 30 points below, reversing the change of the market in which the Trichet’s words have come.
In Ireland, the numbers were published represented the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The detailed parts represent 10,000 million in short-coding price papers and other potential 15,000, to February, they have the opportunity to be with the private capital, otherwise will be established.
Although Ireland has no confidential confidence since the problem has been rejected by stress tests in June, the parts are in the framework of the aid plan acceptable and helped to reduce the native.
However, the next disaster will need the government to receive the approval of the new budget by the Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so there is no government in Ireland.
Angela Merkel decreased the tone of his demonstration to release in the face for the next meeting of the EU ships on 14 December, where it is necessary to go to a political compromise that would show that we are Union and all we are on one ship.
The problem is that German wants to play Wagner, while others would like Beethoven's Odo for joy.
In Spain, the premier had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that will be approved to the Council of Ministers at the fifth.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomic areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures for the living of employment - in the ears of investors, it seems to be four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why Spanish burden grows at 4,5%, so doublely than the other European bulls.
At the difference from February, the government reaction and Spanish national banks were quick and surprising - we do so with the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key delegation for three years, which will be evaluated by the effect of Trichet, because of what we hope, will be a big question that will help divide the doubts of our refinancing capacity.
Asking a safe plan would be for Spain's self-offering.
If we don't need the preparation, in El Tesoro is available for 40,000 million in the preparation, three times more than in March - further high stages and access to the market would be closed to us without day.
However, it needs to continue to use the Strategy of Cesarov's women -- "not to be that, but also to look like it."
We'll do it.
The President of the Group of Eulen will act in Vega Sicilia as required by his children
Bourra in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not active.
David Alvarez, a group funder, will fall after he took it as a "excellent unknown" legal operation of El Enebro's company planned for 16 months and required five of his seven descendants, on which these should try to use their majority and to enforce with the administrative authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus, David and Mary Joseph, provide a legal group for their new chapter to control the parts of the society.
The Maintainer of Employment Services Services may not be able to be able to take place in its effort on membership in the Government authorities of El Enebro.
its administrative committee has been seen five of its seven descendants who have been named preventives during the meeting of the Actions of 18 January this year and their measures are taken in the Community register.
The Court Act of El Enebro planned for the sixteenth month, which was called by the Officer of the Court No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the grief in the Alvarez family.
The judicial approval is to be resolved by the only legal environment that guarantees the Commission's committee.
The last step of Juana Carlose, Pabla, Emilia, Marty and Elviry Alvarez's Mezquiridas considers David Alvarez as a "alphabeous middle of his five children served by the judicial lead and clear law to send and improve operations from 18 January, which was completely untail."
This argument shall be served as a basis for the performance of the legal attack of this operation as a "excellent unexpected".
Samood Protagonists, who discreatedly lying, have already tried to call the judge in June.
in El Enebro, a group of owners near other activity Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Alvarez 100% of capital.
However, the funder of the group requires 51% of the employment law for family protocols.
This matter is a key question that the judge should be decided on the examination of the question of the case of the Treaty. The date of this review was not yet established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapons from Siemens company
Software proposes real time the performance in vehicles.
Since the time Red Bull entered the Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this special world is characterized by surprising and successful.
In the beginning, no one took too serious opportunity to this new neighbory team, and even through a recent tendency from the recent time, they were all sitting on the triumph Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
And we don't want to reduce the legal capacity of the champion, German Sebastian Vettela, or the possibility of the Renault engine that moves his car, in the world Formula 1 was born a legend - "the secret weapons", which the multinational Siemens delivered into the Red Bullu's hand to make a victory team.
In fact, it is about the executive software simulating costs that the German company carried on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote carrier sport.
The same PLM, this powerful software device, was used to prevent mounting lines in products throughout the world, energy equipment, and for high equipment equipment.
His goal is faithfully to reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can be removed to the rest of the products and expenditures.
PLM has improved the development of Canon, Sukhoi airports or the most useful vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, the industry division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software device has allowed the Red Bull team to apply "in a few hours, at least a real time" modification and performance that are otherwise detected during the challenges and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the average of 10 technology were able to achieve maximum of three or four performances during one period.
in the Red Bull team, he works today on 180 young professionals highly qualified by exploited information technology, which analysis and proposes every type of modification of driving vehicles.
The leader from Siemens company explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull car with exclusive engine that is completely responsible for Renault.
Material, pale, aerodynamic and safety elements are modified.
The changes may be converted from virtual reality to the reality during less than 24 hours by the further production systems using the laser and high technologically comprehensive autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the quantity of 40 million dollars representing maximum, which can each team of the Formula 1 provide for each period to improve its competitive capacity.
Red Bull established 50 km from London's shipping technology for the proposal and production of their cars.
One of the two buildings which are limited to income, especially for newspapers.
Everything that comes from here is considered "the great secret."
List of participated projects reads 580 persons including two pilots - champion Vettela and Mark Webber.
Hrdyna Red Bullu is in the Formula 1 without an impression of the famous champion Sebastian Vettel.
For the increasing technological means that the label of energy drinks entered into their participation in the railway circumstances, they also hide other protogonists whose aid is not assessable, and then no one knows them.
Boss of producing technology Steve Nevey says that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress in the research and development of vehicles have contributed to win from 50% and the rest of the drivers was a employment.
In the present, this measure has changed and technologies are successful from 85%, while the pilots are attached to 15%.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the calculation technique because they are "inspectable gladiators".
HP shall fix its own business for two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his business partner Pont Reyes opened his first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the 20 business networks of 80 to 100 m2, which this international company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These businesses will also be located in 16 already existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Vice-President of the Spanish HP Helena Lorder has introduced as an example of a new interrupted sale on the Barcelon Green Via, with Pont Reyes company, with which HP is working for 30 years.
North America's company has adopted a plan for 200 sales places in Europe to 2013, which includes 20 Spain trades.
The first vendors were opened last week in Bukurest (Ruman) and in Belarus (Serbia), the trade in Barcelona is therefore third.
Mrs. She didn't want to see where other vendors would be opened, but she agreed that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Mr., who also leads the HP personal systems, confirmed that the philosophy of opening business is still the same - with the use of local distributors who have experiences and knowledge of the sector.
The Northamerica company here consists of a exclusive design of sales (of products that may be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
Furthermore, the HP is also insurance of the business personnel.
Helena Lorder said that it would be about Franchising, and she felt that the exclusive network of selling has a "moving the customer service, small and central businesses in the buying, service, selling services and even packing."
The trade in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer programme on the world level, which is to resolve accident problems with computer devices in the lock.
Online services are connected to the technical centre in Maastricht (Nizoland).
"So we'll be able for 10 minutes to resolve problems that otherwise can stay up to two days."
"This system is particularly defined for small and medium businesses and for regular employees, with regard to that great company already have a contracting technical assistance service," she spoke yesterday Helena Herrer.
Sabadell says that "slove" in three years of his concurrents
More optimist than other boss, delegated members of Bank Sabadell Bank Council, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be natural for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and prevents the end of the passive war.
However, the reduction of rate sazes, which will try to compense with the extent of bank funds and the price of credits.
Sabadell waits for him for three years to get millions of private clients.
Sabadell found a way to use the following three years and to survive in unnecessary economic conditions.
The Bank will start in 2011 a new strategic plan with effort for three years.
The goal is, except the survival without need to return to the public assistance in the FROB, to participate on the market to undertake millions of new private clients - respectively 700,000, if those who are accidentally abandoning the bank - since until now and at this time, a small and central business and large businesses.
This year has already received a bank of 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Her participation on the market, if it is 3,5% of private customers, while it is more than 10% of the officer.
Further of the basic thoughts of the 2011-2013 Plan is the commitment to productivity, or the security shall also be said to reduce the costs of which the expenditure shows the bank to present the results for the period.
There are no bank institutions in this time to establish their objectives and publish them because the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close his program Optima, established four years ago, although it was originally three years, but the situation on markets required further extension.
The customers who are going out of the meeting will be their main target group.
At the API's meeting, Guardiola continued that 2011 would be "heavy and very important."
It's sure that the way of the crisis in Spanish's "I'll be long."
Furthermore, two or three years will be "the very easy to create employment", which is added to the survival of the bank sector.
And although they believe that the passive war, which reduces the margins, is achieved, the price of the risk that the banks and the concurrents pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, is already moved to the price of faiths which compenses the reduction of the margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural and will be represented a credit factor."
"We haven't locked the cocktail yet, but the differences are very high," he recognized Guardial.
Banesto has already delivered its network on the fourth of the commands to reduce long-term credits and increase the prices of differences - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trends in the bank office are "increasing proceedings", but here is the "concurrent frame".
The Strategy Plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, however, as usually, the group does not involve competitive operations.
It doesn't carefully ensure that in Spanish they'll need greater size.
"The next year it's not staying on stones," he confirmed.
It confirms that the capital needs are "a lot of reduction" and does not indicate that some Spanish institutions enter between the red number.
And indicates that FROB can supplement the collection of funds on the market before the new capital measures.
After ensure that Sabadell can survive a temporary closement of markets, there is a serious problem that some bankers prevent as a new liquidity crisis.
It recognizes that it cannot be given, but, in the absence of what was in June, it may be able to receive short-coding financing using repo sazeb, which reduces the crisis.
The CECA calculates the further flash fuse cutting
The General Director of the CECA denied last night that it should be attached to another forest, and continued on the speed with which the sector reorganization is implemented.
When he started the grouping process of Spanish partners, there were some institutions that ensure that this first phase was not participated and waited on the second round.
However, the General Director of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarriete, has concluded that it should have reached the new full of these operations yesterday.
"I believe that most fuses have already been carried out, incorporation of Cajasolu to the Cívica Bank can't be considered as a second round, which are the agreements."
"The majority is completely carried out; it is possible that we go in place to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish national banks that have cooperated very well in this case," advised the Director.
In its statements on the ADEA meeting (Association of Leaders and Executive Officers of Aragon (note), Olavarriete expressed that the concentration process was conducted "the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as shown in the platforms of its time, not now, found in trade plans with Spanish national banks."
"Come from 45 with a average activity 28,000 million at 17 is 75,500 million in the history of comparison, reducing the number of institutions of 62% to be greater and then in accordance with the Basilian Treaty."
Olavarrite recognised that "the number of non-fast views of the process's exploitation" showing "the rest of seriousness and understanding" because "the fact that the Spanish national bank does is to remember that we must be in the end of year."
The General Director of the CECA José Antonio Olavarriet yesterday discovered that Spain has the best financial system in all Europe and "probably" and in the world, and that those who understood it has contributed to "the rest of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the present economic situation, we can be "called" in respect of financial institutions and compliance with the system that has managed "the very important" concentration process and continues "the highest speed".
It also reminded that the Spanish banking was very well from the stress tests that the European Central Bank had conducted in June.
Saatero and Red German line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but he established conditions for the entire Union.
Two government responsibilities were raised on the markets.
On one hand, Joseph Luis Zapatero proposed new adjustment measures, from reducing the data for small and central businesses, through the regulation of private media agents or disruption of 426 euros for unemployed without dose, until 49% AENA (Spanish airport and airport management), leader of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State lottery.
The President Elena Salgadova with support of the ancient Premier Felipa Gonzáleza was linked to critics on the address of the office of Angely Merkel because of her responsibility for deploying the current crisis.
How to interpret this move?
It will be said before that the opinion of the Mercel is not an error in its communication policy.
In addition, it's another point in the comprehensive eura redefination process.
And here Germany has a radically new view of what to be his future, which brings to the idea of maintaining old traditions, which is maintained by the major part of other members.
The face in the face of the European Resistance in Germany begins to speculate on three possible ways of crisis.
The first of them represents a strong eurozone which would be a part of Germany, but also Rakouca or the Netherlands, while the South States would leave a variety area.
The second is returning to March - although it is now able to be switched, this version has a wide support of publicity, close to 50% of the citizens.
The third possibility is, according to the German proposals of transforming the euro with a larger macroeconomic monitoring, a payment, a review for provincial States, possible payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible costs for a private sector.
The German position is clear and already defines some time, so for the expenditure is no space now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission had deficits in 2009, the German Government of Constitution Reform was departed from the hand of the Constitution Reform, to devote them from 2016.
This was the first note of the discussion between what German considered to be correct (the fisheries and the stability of public finances), and the work of its European partners, including France.
Secondly, this Central European country showed that the Merkel had made a painful decision on the Greek saving.
It was already the subject of critics, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public measures that were also published were strongly against the Greek Safety.
Finally, in the last August days, the Mercel had revealed with a clear opinion when she had requested to reform the agreements of the European Union so that it would be allowed to save a Member State and also have the private obligations of the credited.
This opinion was interpreted as an anti-European because the Irish crisis and all others has been accelerated.
However, its proposal, although in some mixed form, was approved, and in the next months, we should monitor the reform process of the Union which should be allowed to enable these measures since 2013.
Germany was out of a red line that doesn't agree to cross.
And it gives us all that, although now it is necessary to make measures that, of course, do not agree too much, from this date it will be with an older euro-final functioning.
In 2013, new monetary areas will be presented, in which States who have been deceived will be sanctified, and may be able to notify the payment, and the private sector will also have a part of the costs.
Germany indicates that we need to grow a straight way to increase the rate of effort and investment, dead consumption, improvement of production and competitive capacity, and capital reserves.
Other possibilities based on search and buildings, with large spaces in the payment budget, which ruled in the years of the Boo of Spain growth, are not easily agreed to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'll make a mistake if we don't understand.
It is not only on the refrigeration of the public deficit at 3% in 2013.
What they want after us is much more serious.
And the worst is that for these circumstances, we might be able to make ourselves.
I hope this current turbulency will make a bigger calm.
And that we use the opportunity to give us to year 2013.
It seems that the Premier Zapatero also understood it and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting large businesses from the last Sabbath and yesterday announcements of new measures) makes sure that through the criteria to the Merkel's address has opened the way of thinking that it needs to make things good.
However, the red line that German was out there is, and it doesn't seem like she wanted to go with her.
And with the possibilities that can be considered, the department of the euro zones cannot be able to exclude the serious countries.
Well, Germany will always say that he warned us.
Sport and maintenance of rules
Finty, as Alonso and Ramos led to Ajax, shows no sense to disappear the trespass.
The exclusion of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi's Alons and Sergey Ramose) in the front of Ligy Masters against Ajax, on 23 November, made that the sea was written in the insight of whether it is or is not a sport behavior, and whether the EUFA should not be both photobastists.
As it was known, a few minutes before the end of the safe (who had their team clearly gathered), the named players one after the other lost the time at the moment when he had to develop a failure to exceed the sudden, and he showed them a second yellow card.
Thus, both players will be fulfilled in the next challenge against Auxerre - that Real Madrid will end in his group in the chair - and they will be powerful, saved the cart, continue to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA trainer of Joseph Mourin was punished by the Decimal Commission, and the proceeders received money.
The calling of yellow cards for common conditions is not a new practice, but mostly in the photoball.
It's so wide that it's part of the etos of the photoball, so the rules that are not written, but they look.
The party of the discussion in this case took thanks to her participant was the Real Madrid team (which in his honour, which has already seen for the debts of his player), and as it seems, the dramaticization of the led Mourinhem, which is so added to his long history of comedian and producer another episode.
In each case, the debatte is subject to whether this type of operation which is not explicitly prohibited is in relation to the principles of the sport, therefore, whether it is to protect the right; it is a result of the action that respects the sport rules, which, of course, is trying to obey.
It says what kind of disagreements such acts makes a sport spirit.
One of the opportunities of sport behaviour is the physical inevitability of the players that were not disappointed in these cases or have not been achieved to a violent game.
Another of these features of pure games is to exceed that the players have to be able to be able to be attached to the team of the contradictor of the ECU - to what they did not even have happened here.
Then the paradox to the players' actions of Real Madrid is that it wasn't achieved to what we normally characterised as a year or a defense of the right, it did not have the hidden violation of the rules for the purpose of the sanctuary, but this behavior had to be the most appropriate to obtain crime.
They've been waiting, and they're glad to be punished.
Nevertheless, the next question is what a result of the guilty of their significant transgression will be.
Here it is necessary to convince that the supply is not able to be able to be able to be able to achieve any benefit in the current framework, because it is clearly that the team will be less than players.
And it isn't a useful strategy for another sample, because the club will not be able to count with these players.
The agreement is obviously concluded that the players will start another fase of Ligy masters without a cart that could cause their participation in the future stage.
However, it is an issue of a long-term perspective and a certain degree of uncertainty, so, on the first view, the team can be eliminated, and this action will be rejected by the challenges, and they will go to the second round of the cart in which one card is sufficient to exemption less than the first.
So as they're going to continue, it won't be clear if it's going to be done.
Shortly and well, these actions are not against the sport spirit which party is to make a strategic decision that allows to get maximum benefits in the rules.
In the case we're staying here, the players did not have to go out to deal with the crime (if it would be a clear case of preservation of the rules), but they were often chosen when he was to do it.
They have made strategic decisions, unless they were disappeared or escaped before it.
Although there is no border between the impact and the maintenance of the rules is very clear, I believe that in this case it has been avoided in this case.
I seem like that the field is declined from two reasons: because it had been involved on two self-controllings and because of the way he had been conducted by transmission of instructs to their examination from the direction.
Sports principles of these actions are not as ethical as ethnic.
War Menu for the order of dinners in Barcelona
The Calendar Dictate concentrates the years of lake reservation on 16 and 17 December.
It is quickly accommodation of employees who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
As a turc med or lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-new dinners that continue to be carried out as a cycle bomb for restaurant and devices for free time in Barcelona, but the crisis had been made in battle for reducing the price: at least everybody wanted to lose 20 to 30 euros, agreed to the applicants and association from this sector.
To complete the compliance of the numbers, he focused on the calendar this year (when the Day of Saturday arrived at the week) request for a week from 13 December, which took the lawine of reserve for days in the spring (16 and 17.), while there was a week ago.
As this happens since 2008, when a hubble year begins, it is a lot of collective birds that have been interrupted from the budgetary reasons.
In order to not leave tradition, many employees pay a reward for feasts of their own caps.
Without the situation, many require prices on the border of debt, the President of the Restaurant Gremi de Restauration de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the restaurant equipment is not concerned at this time to prevent what will be celebrated in this month.
"The people think that's good before they make reserves."
"They want to go out, but if it's about the price, they're careful."
The trades will go well to those who "they offer quality and good service for a good price," says and remarks that the crisis has a tender to go down and most of the lawyer wants to lose about 25 euros now.
The investigation in various devices shows that the largest reserve request is on 17 December.
The Soteras Group reports the real reserve bow on this fifth, including the most required requirements to 30 euros, which have applied the offered menu which total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another significant company, which is Andilana, reading 16 devices in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and another), brought speciality of aeroplane more time reserves and it has already been from the beginning of November.
"We have done possible and impossible to keep the prices from the lonely year, and our menu from which everyone should choose is moved from 19,95 to 30 euros."
In the AN Group, for which El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and the total number of 23 companies, they remain optimists after they mentioned from the second half of the year of the growth of fishery and have directly solid looks on the fever market.
The resources of this company indicate that the 18th period will also be a difficult day because they will be able to celebrate pre-governmental celebrations between friends.
to their six group menus, they added a currency menu, with a budget for 30 euros or more, as they were noted in comparison with the lonely year of tendency of hosts to lose 10% more exchanges for other items such as the hair (the Spanish smoking wine - known).
They also mentioned that they have already discovered companies that call their employment again, and it seems that the size of the group is something greater.
Vice-President of the Fecasarm company (which includes the institutions as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Center of Free Time in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that it begins to see the end of the tunnel and says that the number of reserves has been "live", although the clients "report at the maximum".
It doesn't take this reach in the offices of the weddings to pay those who pay.
Pakistan Nuclear Programme born a great disease in the United States
Islambad produces the atom's weapons "a faster time than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirm the requirements between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States in Pakistan and the Ministry of the United States, published by the Wikileaks Portal, confirms an extraordinary challenge that builts the Pakistan Nuclear Program in Washington.
According to the clear and significant details offering the content of communication and the thinking of representatives of North American diplomate in Islambad, these documents decline that cooperation between both States, in the case of nuclear security, where it is higher, "he's on the procedure", and that this unstablished Asian country will produce "creasing nuclear weapons than any other country".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that his weapons are not smoothed, but they are based on works to improve their destruction in the case of a attack - represents one of the main reasons for Washington.
This calculates a large-slancy in Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before visiting the National Security Council James Jones: "The nearby of some nuclear equipment within the territory under Taliban control, the distribution of nuclear materials and the ratio of the transport materials of atoms."
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenals and the striking programme is not already observed only the United States, but also Russia, as a wide and representing reason to be observed.
"The Pakistan had to protect nuclear equipment, in view of the level of education and cultures have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or programmes managers," said the expert Juri Corolev from the Russian Ministry to meet their prosecutors from the United States.
The largest newspaper published by Juliana Assange's server is the lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the subjects of the expanding nuclear weapons and the higher time of the Pakistan's production of these weapons.
The embassed embassy in May, which qualifys communication with Pakistan as "fruiting", says: "Transparence is often not available; the benefits of help remain without reception or are refused."
In the next report, Peter Lavoy, the employer of the National Public Services for South Asia, "and through economic katastrophy, the Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other country in the world."
Petterson also requests Washington to consist in the visit of the chief of the army general Ashfaqa Kayani, "the very well explained," that the "pacast army must end with silent support of terrorist groups."
Hon on boss Wikileaks
Both is called a high employee responsible for the fight against the terrorism to exceed new information.
Interpol gives "Red Call" to follow and determine where Assange could be.
All related to Wikileaks and his founder Juliana Assange creates a complicated labyrint where it is difficult to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced the "married call", such as red notice, to "localization and monitoring the movement" of Assange.
However, it's not a classic command to stop.
Furthermore, this call is not new, but it is reported on November 20.
And it does not have anything to do with the last business more than four million diplomatic documents, but with the obligations of sexual use of Australian in Sweden.
According to this, the lawyer of the Creator of Wikileaks Mark Stephens confirms that the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assang.
It was on 20 November when the International Police Congregation with a sister in France Lyon gave this command to the request of Sweden, he not published it until yesterday when he received authorisation from the Sweden authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or location of Assange's "the purpose to identify a temporary design and deliver it."
Although Interpol cannot ensure the arrest of persons relating to the Red Call, many Member States as the organization explained, but they consider red notices for a permitting arrest - it must be ensure that the national police office should be ensure - especially when the States have an agreement on the delivery of arrests, such as in the case of the Sweden and Anglia, where the Assembly should be spoken.
This step decreased by Assenge's lawyers who were published yesterday, published the writings, which announced that Vikileaks, a ninety-year-year-old officer, had the opportunity to answer the questions of Switzerland by the video conference.
They also remind that Assenge requested and then received the authorisation to leave Sweden from the procurator of his case, compared to the legal Lavrentim Paulvicz Berijou, the boss of Stalin's security.
"This is honey and not legally persecution," says the letter.
While the whole world looks for her - and his mother from Australia has the innocentness of her son - Assange is still on an unknown place, yet he doesn't beat.
On Monday, Skype offered Skype from an unknown interview of the shepherd Time magazine - in this conversation requested the Demici minister of the United States of Hillary Clinton.
"If it shows that it was responsible for the United States diplomats to carry up the United Nations spiones and disappear the international agreements that the United States were signed, it should be disappeared."
His opinion was denied yesterday to the white house of Robert Gibbs, who qualified the requirement of demise as "comfortable and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should be interested in the view of a person who carries a web page," he reported to the CNN.
The Samood Obama confirmed the highest employee responsible for combating the terrorism, Russell Travers, to reduce further documents.
The purpose of the Chairman of Baracka Obama to stop adding Assembly in the importance is contrast with the opinions that in those days proclaim the consultative policies and comments.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will since January President of the Committee for National Security in the Downcomer, requested the Ministry for a border to examine the possibility of attaching Wikileaks between the terrorism organization, "so that it might be possible to ensure and to strive everyone who would help them financially or other help."
Tom Flanagan, President of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who announced that Assange should be killed.
"Besides, we should write a reward on him, or use a free pilot fly or something like that."
Whoever didn't forgive, was Mike Huckabee, a baptized priest, the ancient ruler of Arkansas, and the potential candidate to the President.
"Whoever will be in the government, who is responsible for the business of information, has been allowed to be condemned and any other crime than the transport would be too low," said Fox Station
Puigcerkos seeks in the ERC cald "destruction" on the proposal of Caroda
The Republican Leader allows secret voting on its meeting.
Huguet proposes more multiple executives and the end of the social system.
Joan Puigcercós, of course, found a receipt to fight with several internal revolutions in the ERC series (Lewis Republic of Catalan - known.), unexpectedly because of the loss of 11 elders and half of voices.
The President of the parties knows that his gesture on demise seems to the representatives of Joseph Lluíse Caroda-Ruviry, and also know that the influence of this sector is already so weak as his own leader, and that he can absolutely not make such sorrows as he had with others.
That is why Leader Levice will try to get new critics through the destruction that will help him to turn into the current choices.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the Economic Committee would be able to speak secretly to its meeting in the function.
Assistance to voting letters, not by bringing hands.
If the representative of Caroda wants to send a challenge to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of the rejected measures.
In fact, the boss wants to get out of school and details of his person.
In several conversations, he said that he would not be considered confirmed with a half voice and one more, but added not to exceed a percentage that it would not be a good result in the Bulgarian.
The Caroda students require more than to give their functions to the available - what they consider for a gesture that doesn't mean, since Puigcerkos controls the greatest authorities.
But as they do not have enough most of them to explore demis, they will try to remind exectively the plan from now to May.
They are expected to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which will vote to the National Council on 18th months.
Their goal is to support Puigcercos's exchange for that this promised the movement of the congress already at the late 2011.
Leader ERC announced that "multiplevality" delays the stability, and that its goal is that the organization may be able to purchase its shoes in the closed doors.
In this context it seems to be a significant article that the current adviser Joseph Huguet signed on his blog.
After he took the ideal of Puigcerko's ideal, this advice for innovation took for a complete thing that the leader will be confirmed "changed for a few targets".
And he named the five out of them two.
First is the "precomposition" executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means to include new faces that are from the Carod's sector.
The second goal may be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC is completely confronted with the competence as a mechanism of functioning.
And then he fights for the state reform that the conventions may be convinced through the delegated delegations.
The conclusion of the model of the personal system, except in the Spanish political system, is an objective to the Puigcercos team that has already been fighting at two recent meetings in this direction.
However, the Christian meeting since 2008 decided that cooperation should be held on a special convention on state reforms.
This matter is still not established, because the situation inside the parties declined from the solution of this matter.
Now, without a number of critical sectors, it may be appropriate to take place again and try to close it once again.

He reported that the Chinese strategy for climate changes is divided on these four items: dialogue, capacity, building institutions and support of pilot programmes.
In all these points, there have already been stated progress, including the new energy law approval of the lonely approval, which includes the proposed objectives to reduce the emissments of the skin flow, explained.
He further noted that the federal authorities in China cooperated coordinated with provincial and local authorities in order to achieve their objectives, in relation to the energy energy, effective use and reduction of emissions.

in the discussion that was made before the Governor's officer of Gabin Cue Monteagud said that the exemption of Spain is in every case of the decision adopted at local level.
"Only on the autonome decision of the Commission of Order in Sonra."
"Mr. Espino has the right to turn into its case through the courage to the Court of the National Council in order to act on the decision made by the competent authority," added.
He further explained that there is no time to think for 2012, and that it was never at the exhibition table on the presidency candidate.
Nava Vazquez declared his confidence that the PAN will go out of the internal options of the following 4 and 5 December, in which his followers will be sent.
"This (Aliance in 2012) is the subject that never had been at the exhibition table, but at least not, it was the purpose of local choices that had been successful and fulfilled his goal."
The President of the PAN said that on his side is 71 years of dialogue, and that's why "we're not nice to the internal consciousness, we're still courageous and strengthening us," added.
He said that without debatting, the Committee could choose the best President or President that will serve for the three years of the PAN, so he will give the steafe to the "Who will the Committee decide."
"I'm therefore absolutely quiet and free, I'll bring the President's offices of the parties."

Obama propagates Twitter's law to support students without evidence
"If you think that the adoption of the law of Dream Act is right, let you know your senators and take it to apply this law," tweet American President on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama, with a contribution to his personal Twitter social network today, linked to national mobilisation on the law of Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the adoption of the law of Dream Act is right, let you know your senators and let them apply this law," tweets Obama.
His short report warns the Internet link to a public document that requests publicity to note the senators, since the vote is close to this law.
"When it's expecting that the voice is going soon, now it's on a moment, let your opinion be surprised," indicates.
The report was published after 42 of the Republic Senators had exceeded the blocking of any law, if not approved the reduction of the data from the Busha Eries and the Financing of Government.
Such blocking reported by the letter signed by 42 Republic Senators could influence the vote on the Tream Act and other projects, such as ratification of the new contract with Russia against the broadcast of nuclear weapons, named START.
When the Republic of the Act and other proposals were investigated, the President said that when it was resolved, it would be possible to establish a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe it's still a long time."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the case of data before the end of the year."
I believe that we can be able to achieve the agreement in this matter in a certain moment and then we will be able to plan ordinary of other matters," he said.
The Democratic Democratic Leader of the Senate Harry Reid announced, in the absence, that it would be requesting "Conference on Close Disputation" on the law of Dream Act, so that it would have been proposed to legalization students without evidence to vote from the next fourth, although it is most likely to be the next week.
The Senatory Adoption of Dream Act or the law of "American dream" would be legalized by 800 thousand young people who received in the United States 16 years ago, lived in the country during the past five years and were adopted to a higher education or military institution.
However, the groups need to apply the proposal of 60 votes, therefore they need aid of some of the republists, so that the organizations of his representatives carried out a intensive attitude to ensure that the law is approved.
Democratics, whose majority of Dream Act supports, have 58 Mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against, and only one republic, Richard Lugar from Indian, expressed his support for this law.
Thus, the staffs of the draft Dream Act need to receive a number of republists for the case of further democratic decisions to deny the proposal.
In the middle of the Republic Senators, with which hundreds are most exempt, are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as a separate senator from Florida George Lemieux, who added the Senator Mela Martínez.
Next Republics who have supported Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utahu and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they told you that the next one will not support it anymore.
The next republic who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet been departed.
Although the Snimovna representatives are attached to other versions, according to the majority of the analyticals, Dream Act will take the largest surprise in the senate.

The second cycle cycle Happiness from the language was a promenade where the participants have submitted the literary gal of the presentation
"I understand Sex in language, but... what's going on from me?" said the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second role of joy from the language, a cycle who glorifys the literature written in Spanish language, and her question was used in this opportunity as a subtitler (in another blonde in the cycle of the Sex in language, explained).
In the morning, "We're leaving to the smooth," she brought a silver writer to the public, based overwhelmly from the young people who came to the International Witness Book in Guadalajar, to hear this debat on the cycle table, the moderated Marisol Schutzo and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergei Ramirez, Mayry Monters and Louise Garcia Monterre.
Luisa Valenzuel reads the text that convinced Gonzalu Celorio, and that Schultz marked later for a wonderful opinion in which Luisa was first as a protagonist, whose "morrow" comes from a doctor who does not answer her, even if the rate of the story is yes.
From the infectology, it's sure, "Peace is not my strong side, maybe it's my morning."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her deck in the middle of the way, he explained her that the morning is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalytic that disappears the secret: "The morning represents it really developed, and that is a symbolism."
The Protagonist was declined away and concluded that "the shooting of her was able to know so much that it was actually developed and that it wasn't existing," but she realized that pleasure and surprise in the language should go together into the hands.
Valenzuel's writer played with the board.
The Nikarageiro Sergio Ramirez also went out with a joyful statement that he called Gloria investment, in which there is no bottom named in the road, but in a moment it appears.

"Cervantes, who found us all (writers), was exclaimed by a fancy witness that was presented in history as real, but in other ways, there was no way to tell the history of America with such images that even traveled to study."
Yet, he said, "They are foolish and lying who have greater fantasy" and just where it spreads reality and lies, where you don't know what of the story is in one group and what's in the other, gets a fixed literature of his top.
It's called "Cervantov Tradition".

The Cuban-Portography writer showed his throat on a great rate of social violence that passes through its country - and shares it in Latin America - and it is the result of trade sports and drugs.
"I think good literature, good poesia and good letters end silent compromises that, of course, doesn't think," she said, "the reality of literature is a communication and a dimension of compromising that is created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
Tonight, the Spanish boxer Luis Garcia Monter, whose exhibition also made "to this board in the front of the writer of the writer."
He said that in the world who lives quickly, also in intellectual standards and control of knowledge that overcomes dogmatics, it's forgotten that it's hiding small not and that in any way, it's too small.
"To have our ideas and reality, we have to make a color: and to make it a lot of times to put the pit into the ground and to smooth the units that are more agreed as thinking in the charts, the black white, in the fixed ideas and without color, and also to delay the authorities that prefer this black world," he proceeded to support the meaning of the write.

Now, with the Santos Laguna club in Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against "Diablos" from Toluka, Ruben had a threat again, although his team played against the "Uniters" (forward oversee club Deportive Toluca - note.) after 210 minutes of games in the range of 2-2, after a series of challenges, he arrived to the east of three on one and had two opportunities to take a title, but at the end of his three-minute games with 11-minutes and three-founded tricks to 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against "The Red Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to go out of the same condemnation, and he could first glorify the title, although he says that it's the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a wind, I don't want to make the statistics, that's for the club, for the cup that I've taken, and the title would certainly be for me, but the first is the most important," said the trainer when it was considered about the number that speaks in the final against him.
In the living memory, there is the previous final in which he confirms, how he learned, "We have learned that until the end of the unbelievable end we can't celebrate, we have to be prepared for action, the same player, because the last two penals, we have already been prepared to celebrate, and I think we learned in this until the end is done, we can't be praised."
It doesn't worry that this series could decide in criminal shoes, believes to your players, "You're never trying to get to a series of crimes, you're trying to finish in normal times, but sometimes there's no other opportunity and it must be prepared, in the past toury, we were prepared, because we're still able to get a bad tattoo, even if we were in our hands, but we've been able to do what we're going to do, and we're not going to do this time."
Romano has an opportunity to stop being the other and to read the first glory they bring the titles.
United States change the rules for the share of wine
People will need to be turned to the Service Centre for the requests of knowledge before talking to the Consular Division; costs will be lower and shorter for the expected time.
Since 10 January 2011, the process of production of water on the United States and consulates will be amended.
with a new procedure, most of the applicants must be returned to the Service Centre for the wine requests (received from the ASC) before talking on the Consullar Division.
Personal from ASC will receive biometrical information of the applicant and they will be evaluated by the Consular Division before the discussion.
The new procedure will have certain expenditures between the following:
The total costs for the equipment will be lower, no longer payment for meetings, the second for the processing of requests and further for the document of transport services.
The victim's request is only the only payment that covers all three services.
The current tariff is not changed: the cost of 140 dollars for tourist visa, 150 dollars for cases of demand (including wine for temporary employees) and 390 dollars for visa for trade and investors.
People who want to renew their wine will not have to resolve the conversation with the consulary officer, but only return to the nearest ASC where they provide their evidence and they will be rejected by the pressures of the balls.
Considering that biometric information will be rejected in the ASC, requirements that will require a second meeting with the Consullar Division, here will take a shorter time than in the past.
Likewise, those who will ask a visa on consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will not pay additional payments for 26 dollars.
For further information about new procedure on the request of visa, visit the following website http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Vissa-FAQs.html
NASA notifications of external life
The American Commissary Agency called tomorrow the pressing conference to present a statement that could cause a crime in searching for a strange life.
The National Air and Universe Authority (NASA) of the United States tomorrow report in the fourth, astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of existing alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow in 13 hours of astrobiological experts, science, which are occupied by the origine, evolution, expanding and future of life in the universe, on the NASA's press conference in Washington.
When she invited the newspapers, the NASA confirmed that it represents the "development that causes the evil in search of a foreign life" which has built the specialization of experts from other countries.
It could confirm the theory that there are other creatures that live in unfortunate conditions, which were considered unlimitable, and who could imagine that one of them would be an intelligent creature, such as people, if they are better conditions in which they live.
It is one of the microbs that was found on the day of the ship of Mono in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in the environment that was considered too food for any form of life, because the ship is rich on the arsen.
The creation of the Arsen uses its life in some way and just his capacity increases the probability that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to the astrobiologists, if these organisms use in their metabolism arts, it will be proved that there is another, the second form of life, different from what we know.
The Cosmic Agency reports the real period of revelations tomorrow print conference.
The Conference is a participant geobiobook of Pamela Conradova, who studys the possibility of existence of life on Mars; the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest month of Saturna) with the perspective that his chemical integrity is similar to the earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón plots "blok"
The Reforms of the Office Act on the Congress lead to the next "bipartism" are proclaimed.
There was no longer started 60. Parliament's period when the Congress has been attached to an opposition block, a member of the PRD (Partido de la Revolution Democratic, Czech "Strana Democratic Revolution"), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech 'Strana work'), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" note.) and Jesus, Manuel Patron Montalvev, who had been published in unconsciously, and those challenges were discussed about one thing: "Avenirs" to Smov.
Before the start of the 60th Parliamental period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "firmed" against the Reform of the Official Law, because it is established.
This reform, they repeated, starts "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control the Congres.
These four messengers, together with Gloria Margaritou, the Coordinator side of the PRD, were the only one who voted against the Council, led by Salvador Lopezem Brit from the PAN side (Partido Action, Chess "National Action Site" - note.) and Louis Cardenas Fonsecou in Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo pointed out that these reforms are institutionally established by a political marginality from the PRI side (Partido Revolutionary Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Side) and PAN.
He suggested that during the following days, the representatives of the PAN and PRI will be discussed to change the scheme on the basis of the political will, and if they do not have it, they will be detailed by these two parties, which has finished the opposition coalyce.
"When she came here, I'm looking at it, because we've made a decision, even they don't want to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from the Convergence showed that PRD, PT and Patrón agreed, and therefore they will create a plural group.
Unable to allow, he continued to keep the Congres after he was a monopol, now he was "double."
Aspirating law reforms is not to be an infinite bipartism in the Congress.
This group begins with five lawyers and its members now talk to other colleagues and colleagues to get more voices as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT page explained that in the present time the Congres became "the benefits" two - in the carrying on the PAN and PRI pages.
"Before she controlled her only one side, they divided him two today."
Mother Montalvo asked her to respect the ministry's personality to give him a place on the one table.
"To make us five messengers that probably will be nine, but just now he will see us in five, it will not remain because of the clouded agreement, every one in another fraction, we agree to find a place on the one table, because the problem is that in the reform they created and rejected, we stand outside, and we don't agree with this reform."
It's offered more than 200 thousand pesos for the "additive"
The Council in Mazatlan will pay another shock discussed companies who add electromaterial.
Another shock for more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to Lorenna Guadalupe Camach's Palazuelos.
This sum is paid in this second half-year companies who add electromaterial are exceeding 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency of the Council, this last chair of 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, it was established at the rate of 200,144,56 pesos and, as it was mentioned, "realation of non-replaced payments".
The officer Louis Miguel López Moreno noted that the neighbor would pay this additive, which was monitored by the United States Review Authority for selling for high price, another business.
What wasn't said is the whole entire branch that still needs her railway, and how many shoes will be sent in the use of Camach's Palazuelos.
"It was not now buyed, but it's just paying to her what we need to do, as the other additives," he spoke in one conversation.
The last shoes were "recovered" in the last quarter of year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this employment was not yet published in the Official Letter, as indicates the law in the case of the Office of the State Review Authority, that their services should use other administrative authorities, the officer ensures that the additive of the additive was not renewed.
In the past period, after July 25, Noroeste published the reviews of shock reviews made to his additives, which declared that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the third-year old period of Jorge Abela López Sáncheze, was paid to Camach Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos through 42 shoes.
It also realized transactions with Jumapam, where she insected shoes to more than 3 million pesos.
Turist places need to be maintained
Turists are in the context of the accident of the front tourists because of the bad status of Sance Taboady in Mazatlan.
After the west tourists fall into Sãocheze Taboady, the tourist sector in the Mazatlan Agency requests to reveal the attention of the areas and places that are in the bad state, and not showing such access in a good light.
Salvador Barza Rubio, President Association of the Trade Area of Zona Dorada, reminded that they were reiteratedly requested to take a target, and that is bad that tourists are here to be replaced by new activities or transmissions.
He showed that the bad status of the street and travellers work on tourists who walk here and see the wrong order that affects nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's to close for a day of business, and they don't have a presentation of markets that are unnecessary, otherwise, they wouldn't resolve so long and without a correct planning."
Hotelier José Ramon Manguart Sánchez said that there was no preventive measures and maintenance from the railway side.
"The Council will have to overcome the responsibility and decrease to repeat something such, the preventive maintenance should be reviewed, not only to amend existing offences," said.
We would like to use a clean town, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should be maintained, although as citizens we serve pure lives, the rady should change our strategies for the maintenance of the city."
There are also other places that look at easy and poverty, he recognised, for example, the Mazatlan Emblém and El Venadito (monument, green socha - note.).
"In today, to come to tourists, not only depends on propagation, it is necessary to offer a good product, so a city that exposes the cleaning of their boats and the streets where the tourists are carried out," said.
"It's not the necessary attention here, and these facts show something that is well known, it's missing.
He spoke about a number of places that should be good in cooperation with the advice, he said that the priority should be maintained by the city clean and incorrect to be attractive because he has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the Turist Promotion subsequent, said that the safeguard of tourist locations in Mazatlan is inadequate because they are not correctly used and do not do good.
Fortunately, Mazaran offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces that will first be needed to give to the right to handle these places and to bring them to the list we have propagation of this destination."
IP requests after the Congress of Results
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, would want the messengers to overcome great responsibility to go through the example of looking for the better Sinaloy, in various examinations of the State.
The Parliament's fulfillment of full employment and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive requires a business sector in Mazatlan, since Sinaloa is raised in striking and major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60. Parliament's time was started with seven political forces, 19 PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the party Partido New Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergency, and the last part of the PVEM, which contains the total 40 national representatives.
On the list of waiting from new members of the Congress is to achieve appropriate guidelines, with responsibilities against society and various areas required a responsible legislative work, and that the same parental and patriarchs will not be restored.
Eduardo Daaltos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently chosen 40 attendants of the Congress’ Congress have been responsible for a great responsibility and have been along the way for the better Sinaloa in various examinations.
"We hope that the messengers will actually fulfil their law, without agreement between the parties, because they usually make measures to proceed their own interests and become carneval properties of governments and members of Parliament's fractions."
He therefore spoke that it is necessary to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary excursion that the Government should be sent before the order.
"We want them to decline the perfect work and to be taken in particular to society and sectors, because they were citizens of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in the past trust options."
José Ramon Manguart Sánchez, President of Tres Islas Hotel association, stated that one of the largest explanations for 40 national leaders will collect all powers in order to achieve the economic growth of the country because the current economic situation is very sustainable.
The most important is to contribute to the economic growth to create investment and infrastructure offers, which support in certain ways of relationship with workplaces."
In the case of the travel movement, he requested the new lawyers to give him greater courage in the framework of the State budget and to support the Ministry of Turism.
"I learned that it is the Ministry with the second lower budget, which is unreasonable in view of the important economic activity, which brings values and investment, which is directly supporting agriculture."
Furthermore, the Congress should help to add the State to safe and assist the law of alcohol that could not be resolved in the previous Parliament's periods.
They're looking for three kings
Painting, carriers and rings are together with other games on the list of children's children in the family of Coronad Valenzuel.
For their parents, three kings will be difficult to fulfil their imaginations, because their household is reading exactly 12 people and one berana.
However, Adeleida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Caspar, Melichar and Balthasar make the games and clothes that they use so much.
Family lives in a smooth village in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor levels because the father has no job.
"It's sometimes hard because the husband has no happiness, but we're sold mannings and brambos... I'm going out with the "plebby" on the street to sell the street," said Cayetan Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the kids.
Four-year-old Adelaida's head or round, while her third-year-old sister Isabel would like Mrs. Barbie.
If it goes about the eleventh year of Joseph Alfred, he wants a time for a "monster" car, and for his eight-month brother Jesuse, Cayetan would take a clothes in the size of one year.
"He told me (Jose Alfredo)" I'd like this monster car, but I told him "we'll see a son" because he was very dear," she remembers the suffering of Cayetan.
For older children who were just in school would be ideal clothes and bottles.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, has the size 12, the decade of Isaiah size 10, where the eighth Miguel has the size 8.
The fourteenth year of Joseph Juan misses tennis, so he would have a few of the sizes five and half or six.
If you want to help meet children dreams from the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Seek Three Kings", and on the reception of the New York Times to bring gifts or money in ready.
14 Agency negotiators with drugs arrested
The tenth spectrum was carried out in Estria, in the middle, in the framework of liquidation of the network for production and sale of the Indian conopia.
Fourteen persons were arrested, and they were in various accusations.
The visits were traveled in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, especially in the places she served to produce drugs.
"Nearly 750 inches of Indian conopia, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce was broken," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, talking to the police in Quebec.
He was totally arrested 11 men and three women, both bodies of all this network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to be able to get into the court pale in Sherbrook next after their arrest.
They may be accused of the production of the Indian conope, his disobedience with the purpose of negotiating with him, smoking and smoking, among others.
These views were achieved after the long-term investigation that had been held at least a year.
"It was the information we received from the public and allowed us to access these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was participated at 70 policies of the Regional Development Research City of the State Police of Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the police management of Sherbrook Memphremagog.
The illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of concerts who should regulate the problems of the ships established by illegal advice would be clearly able, while all three opposition parties in the middle of the Government were not able to support it.
"I'm sure I'm talking about Chart."
"I'm standing on the side that she built a glass under your feet," announced Michael Ignatiff, leader of the liberals Michael Ignatiff, turning the messengers around the weekly meeting of the week of du caucus.
The Liberal states that the proposal of the law as proposed, the law that allows to keep any person from the ship, identified as an illegal advice of the Canadian chart of law and freedom.
Boss of Chebec Blok, Gilles Duceppe, also said that he couldn't support the law's proposal because he directs to a bad goal.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposite sides are against, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD crisis in question relating to the problems of approach, Olivia Chow, refused criticism that wants to be too strong if it is an illegal approach.
"No-democratics agree to adopt measures against illegal accommodations and this is what we consider as a near part of another proposal of the law, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We don't support the proposal of the law of the Conservatives, because he steals the vindication of the surface and puts into prison children for at least one year," explained Mrs Chow.
The Ministry for the migration of Jason Kenny committed opposite sites.
"The Canadians give the messengers to not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations that Canadian take on the museum and work with it as a patholic patholic."
They expected that Canadian will take the final measures, the Minister Kenny reacted.
The Government did not report the vote of confidence in its proposal of the law, which would be able to bring the land to the election of the leader to its refusal.
One of the concerts said the QMI agent that the Government will request a vote that each messenger who is against is answered from his position before his voter.
New unit does not mean uniformity
In addition to the notification , as possible , the establishment of permanent units for the fight against corruption and collision, many observators still require the creation of the public investigation Commission for the present problem.
The Ministry of Public Security, Robert Dutil, encourages that this thought would not forget: Quebec agrees with the Department of Investigation from New York to discuss this problem already in January.
Metropole is available for an anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why the ancient announcement of us was surprised.
It is necessary to realize that in the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was not implemented, although Robert Dutil was also alone.
Furthermore, it was not necessary for public security criticism, the PQ staff of Stephane Bergeron, to assess this announcement as a "crown exhausted from the clock" and "mather's solution broken on the road."
The Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that the political power has too great influence on the possible future of units.
"They'll be happy with confirmation: you'll see the result when we'll tell it."
"We know this problem."
For the President CSQ, Rejean Parten, nothing can replace the audience of witnesses in public translation.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest suggests that they don't want to create this investigation Commission, and people think, as you and I, that something hide," explains.
"The only means for the creation of the investigation Commission is Jean Charest", explains the data of Yves Boisvert, ethics and policy professors in the Office for the education of high-State Officers.
To get out of this blind street, he proposed Quebec to make a special strength to the general inspector to investigate collisions and corruption.
"We have to be able to expand the mandate of the general inspector," decided.
It is also because Quebec could give the inspector the same authority as the Commissioner that allows people to testify.
The creation of the continued working group is not the only proposal in Charesto Government's chairs.
The Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Treaty Court, so that it would be better applied to this type of criminal action.
This request would exceed from the power of Marteau (Kladivo) operation, which had informed the Ministry of Justice Jean-Marca Fourner that the judiciary in this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of the court, Rob Nicholson, is just concerned with some amendments that are associated with this letter.
In the operation of the year 2001, which was attached to a group of vehicles, although the Treaty Act was not yet established, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottava later left the changes in the Law of gangstership.

The ships on the north of the river and in the valley of Outaoya were most attached.
It could fall all over 100 millimeters.
If we calculate these branches with the branches of snow collected in some sectors, we can be able to fear in some water torches.
The Quebec's Safety Service reported in the middle of the evening warning before the danger of the Uareau River and Achigan, Lanaudière.
The Greeks at the north, in Saint-Jerome, in the Las Laurentides, and in Chen, in Lotbinière, became the objective of national equipment and increasing controls.
In the area de Lanaudière, some ships were made to develop in Saint-Julienne, in Saint-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the result of strong rains was a prominent monster.

The Quebec Centre for the prevention of the candidate was made in the middle of warning before strong people for some rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly browsing
The Quebec Challenge moderator Stephane Dupon has suffered a party in the field of the Canadian Council for the standards of vocational and television (RRTV) for the control of the products relating to social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as because of severe expression during the e-mail.
The Council for speaking and television sentence judges that Mr. Dupont and his group of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but some explanations contained "incompatible information on social assistance and incompatible negative expressions of the Haitian's severe exhibition that does not correspond to the sentence of the day."
The Council also concluded that the debate on self-association, including sending the names of both persons who have lived, had not violated the provisions for the voting sentence.
The Board of Speech and Television has received several interests of the comments made during the e-mail sentence between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the competence of the Community frontiers of the social support of Quebec.
The group said that the parts referred to in the sentence were unexpected.
The moderators must provide a similar information, not crazy.
What about self-defense, the moderator Stephane Du Pont thought that self-defense was a gesture of disagreement.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the report was as a result of self-assistence could not be understood as the solution of the problems of each day of life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the sport episodes of the "Dupont's passenger reports" have been addressed to a delicious and appropriate subject."
It wasn't raised to him any excuse.
The last sport was concerned with the statement that followed after landing on Haiti.
Stephane Dupon and Jean-René Dufort, then, came to a medical shooter that called a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator announced that he didn't send any gift to help the Haitians, because we can't be sure that the needs will actually get money.
The Commission believes that these comments were not authorised but that their cumulative effects are not compared to the negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already denied my classic section of that thing."
"My write is unknown for one and half years," he reported the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to be used in sending severe exemptions.
The CHOI-FM has cooperated "on the framework of its obligations."
For the station that shall notify otherwise this Decision once during the period of three days, it shall be minimum results.
The King of the Wing-fuvà Montrealu.
A resident of Montreal, origin of Algerus, Naceredine Zemmal, has extremely special time.
Atlet exploited in "sanda" (kung-fu "ful contact"), in the kickbox and the Thailand box, enters the fathers and rings of the whole world and looks for new calls.
"I started with war arts like kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algerian, explained Zemmal, who lives in the main city since 2008 to learn professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for a little bit over there, because for those who don't like games on the country that appears in battle sports, they're a party in North America."
Recently, this person who works as a protector and as a supporter for the UPS company just added to his supporters a bad news when he played two gold medailles to the world mystery in the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburg, in Scozia.
"I tried the kickbox full contact and the Taiwan box."
"In the present time I'm ready to China for the world start in the sand shoe."
"They were invited supporters who finished the first four of the last world mystery in each category."
"In Toronto, in 2009, I won Bronz."
"In 2005, I've finished eight."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tourage in the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009, I ended the third."
"I'm interesting that I got a progress in every conscience."
"This time I'll be the first year or an advance."
"San Shou" or "Sanda" is a disciple from China where the pigs and the feet are, as well as the hook on the ground, are allowed.
The skins are trained on the board and more in the ring.
The most famous boxer, who is excited from this form of battle, is the Vietnamian American origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of war sciences.
Although Nacer Earth has to keep in his carrier only one result, he confirms its participation in the superturion "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.

450 million unexpected without public concurrence
Hydro-Quebec agreed after an agreement with 450 million in contracts with companies offering engineering on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this labour more than 100 contracts, it is just a consortion created by the BPR, Dessau, the Group of SM and Axor, which has obtained the most significant contract, the total project management of 295 million dollars without a public consent.
This consorcium, named Energy Garance, was fulfilled in 2004 with the election of Hydro-Quebec, to carry out its responsibility for this significant hydroelectric project in $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consorcium "Energy Garance" has obtained a lucrative contract without any public statement.
For the Quebec part of the consorty of the company, there is a serious problem of the ethical character that risks the exclusion of competition and chooses prices higher.
"It's a new way to realize the collision and explore competition."
"It means that people, who do no secretly, they do it openly today," announced the PQ Sylvain Simard messenger yesterday to the print conference.
Something before, morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Conference, because he says he's hard to make a public interest to be sold by this.
The Ministry for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, last week, described that it would go to this contract on colussion.
"I have my own way," she threatened and said that PQ was "inposible" and "throwed up the rightness."
She said, "It would be the less," that I would apologize PQ.
Recept for the creation of competition is a regular practice in the world.
It is usually related to an alternative, limited during the time that allows two or some companies to comply with their companies with each other to respond to the call to the proceedings of a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very compatible with the contents of work.
The stage is already running and must be resolved until 2012.
However, the contract was recognized without concurrence; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to recognize that the consorty formula is not already in Quebec exception, and it is not in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir denied last week, the consorty formula in the field of energy is the subject of investigation in the government.
If we move in the speed of chebec firms, we can find it more than 200 consorts, and some appear to be created.
This company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we call CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and they're ten, leads to one and also legal person, and this is Dessau.
If it goes to the Consorty of Energy Guerance, the Ministry Normandeau submitted particularly that "the country of the Baie James is a typical special dynamic of work forces and that Hydro-Quebec reacts on it since 70 years."
The Eastmain Project, Real Laport, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), explained that we are allowed to cut us on the fact that the draft management agreement was closed after one agreement.
"If you go to the public cohesion and if a few participants have a contribution to the offering, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: you'll collect people who figure in that law as participants of joy, and you'll say, "We'll close the agreement with a joyful and a good price."
"But the main thought is that the price is not important, but the competence of people," confirmed Mr. Laport.
This contract made by Energy Garance is a part of the long contract list for more than 50 000 dollars, which received the Quebec Street.
The contracts were closed with the Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ company on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupiter project.
After the confirmation of Le Devoir, 109 contracts on the advice of the energy contract concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their companies, especially with laborators carrier analysis.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, from which Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without participating in "Energy Gerance".
All contracts were closed.
Accommodations are $449 783 344, including contract with Energy Guerance Company 295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard stated that four companies who are part of the consortion (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "the very good knowledge of the Liberal Quebec Side".
The Ministry Normandeau reported that the PQ is also connected to the companies that "financing it" before she concluded that she had a case about her manager.
Barmeter responsible consumption - "Green" tag does not extrude confidence
More green, but openly sceptic.
The Quebec consumer is very fewly trusted in the actors of maintainable development, but also "indigent" tags and environmental evidence that he should be guided by the election of products.
This is the worst thing that even if we buy in the medium universe that is worthy of us and offers a Community responsibility, this medical universe says about the loss of faithful information, the unfulfillment of the obligations that even qualifies as a part of its obligations, the Barometer will provide the responsible consumption that its first article has gone yesterday.
Although in 2010 the consumption has increased so much responsible products, the Quebec citizens who are trying to sell them, yet they do not believe
Two thirds of us say in fact that they don't believe the fire promises relating to the environment, just because the green companies are achieved by a measurement tool that made the Observatory responsible consumption in Sherbrooke.
Other recognition: the half of the consumers are surprised of the faithfulness of official tests based on justified products, but also of the faithfulness of products and tags that are referred to as ecological responsibility.
In the same way, and the policy processing on this subject is accepted as a serious 14.6% of the Quebec citizens.
The responsible consumption information seems to be a prejudice for the stimulation of this page of consumption living at least at least the third territory of chebec consumers.
Actually, vacuum and a serious character of information would be reduced to over 46% of consumers.
This is the second point that he identified Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Lastly, the third of the Quebekus citizens will establish untrusted data on products or "Green" services we seek to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, at least half of the consumers were intended to change their normality and, in particular, change the tag of one or some products that would respond to their surveys.
The total 61% of them was worthy of purchases in their fourth markets and gave the preservation of the purchase of foods that were grown in their region, says Barometer.
More "Green" and responsible - index responsible consumption has received 64 of the maximum 100 for this year -, Home consumus Quebec is glad to be represented as King Recycling, which enhances the minimum impact on the environment because it's old for the protection of animals.
However, their society and environmental conscience was clearly left outside their car, Barometer: in 2010, 28% of the Quebec citizens said that they used a large transport or that they recommend the use of cars to carry at least two persons, in the interest of nature protection.
The training and round was also supported for 39,1% of the participants of this rare training investigation that used this clinically.
State party for sale complex ki eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we requested for a financial participation to purchase eXcentris of the Community Angus et le Parallele, is agreed to cooperation, but only to the top of the piece.
The Developers company "Angus et le Parallele", which used a gift for seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy a chinematographic complex on the Bulvary of Saint-Laurenta, and that showed his message as a loving movie universe, did not reject what he wanted.
The Government accepts the fact that it will be included in documentation but for its own conditions.
Although the expected gift proposes the Government of Quebec, whose higher would be less, was a original expectation which could establish the basis for life-wide solutions for specific conditions and the resources from the State.
The first action plan and requirements for 12,8 million were already rejected by Quebec loni on the ground, but the requests were already reviewed to reduce.
The proposal and action plan has sent the Minister of St-Pierre President of the Community for the development of business in culture (SODEC), Francois Macerola, which leads a chemographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent 10 days ago.
But the contradiction of the government has come to SODEC's company in the outside.
The Parallele and Angus have time until 31 December to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the State must be rejected.
Remember that the Constitution of Kynematographic Leaders and Kinematographic Centers in Quebec had been established against the right investment of the State to support the eXcentrise, using that the Ministry of Culture does not finance a project relating to difficulty when it did not for other businesses.
However, several participants were discussed, even though, required essential economic support.
Daniel Langlois, leader, got his room for ten years after he funded a complex structure, which could be reasonable to change from the State's financial Council.
The absence of rooms for independent films is crying in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to get a customer.
The company of Angus et le Parallele, with Christian Yaccarini in his chair, leads a campaign for freedom of financial funds into the private sector, in the faith that 700 000 dollars are cutting for axis.
Since 2009, one of three film companys, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute movies for eXcentris.
The goal of future visitors is to open all three chambers on 27 February and pronounce the best film Xavier Beauvois Manji and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remind Le Devoir and then ignores him, he thinks of his group of proposals to reduce him.
Get the bottom to Canadian as a whole...
The new American diplomats referred to in the knowledge of WikiLeaks decline what the United States think as complex of the Canadians in the front of the Americans, but those who are the officers of their feelings of overseer of the last named Canada.
The American diplomats therefore wonder that on each Canadian electoral, the heart of Canadian-American relations, when he calls, and believes that the visit of President Obamy helped the concert government to accept its budget in 2009!
Four new reports between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday designed for publicity, provide more citizen details to get "sub cock."
Communication with the date 22 September 2008, including in the middle of the election campaign, detailly indicates in which point the United States are not part of the parts of the political leaders.
To the great estimate of the American majority in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives this situation a few explanations.
"The Canadian complexity of minority, at least exciting, encourages the possibility of political leaders to speak about internal advices, instead of understanding that these options are involved in the United States (as in the campaign on the free area in 1988), writes.
"The United States are then," he closed, "the name of the privilege in these options: it is essential, but potentially too serious than to speak about them."
The Greater understands this "deep silence" of less than that both countries keep intensive political and economic relations.
"It's logical that the capacity of candidate, sides, or more leaders to guide these important relations should be a key factor who has a choice on the mind when they go to the choice."
Other expressions of this importance we can read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 Terry Breese, a carrier of business in Ottawa to Ottawa, preparing President Baracka Obama on his first visit to Ottawy.
"Your path is helping to ensure the preservation of governments in voting to trust in the beginning of February, in relation to the federal budget that Canada publicly recognizes its first deficit for more than ten years, because of the plan of renewing at 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
Nothing mentioned that the Government had to repeat the proposed meetings to the Parliament to not be established by coalition and that the opposition parties reduce their survival by the quality of the proposed renew plan.
Another report from January 2008 and subscribed by Major Wilkins, states Washington on how much more negative images in the United States are carried out the dramatic series sent to the CBC.
Leader is concerned by sending Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can not see too significant links to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also for the purposes of violence in the CIA.
Another report refers to that Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is prepared to accept some prisoners from Guantánam.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the principle "a case."
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "It's got a paper about Omar Khadr, the 15-year-old muslim of the Canadian origin, the State Secretary."
"The secret has accepted that the folder is reduced."
Let's finally recognize that the persons who are about WikiLeaks are comforting.
Tom Flanagan, an older adviser, very close to Stephen Harper, announced the CBC fields that a person responsible for this massive business should be "destruction".
It was talking about it and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
World lighting plan
The United Nations proposed last night in Cancún the plan for the renewing of home light, the light of trade and industry spaces in 100 countries in order to achieve the limits of the glass effect (CES), which corresponds at least one third of the limits which must be to be achieved to stabilise the climate of the planet from now to 2020.
This ambitional plan is located in the stadium of large specific projects that the United Nations wants to postpone in Cancún to compense the absences of difficult implementable obligations to reduce on the industries of comprehensive countries.
In accordance with the last planned, if the desired vessels that are more than 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by fluocompact or, better, with electrical diodes (DEL or LED in English), the essential quantity of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the GES shall be issued on the planet of the surrounding planet for the celebration of April.
The light is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
It's an equivalent of 70% emissions from a car park on the whole planet.
In the Codean in the lone years, a large country with significant part of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and the other, among them, Canada, had established good plans for reduction that should allow global Emissions of GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to decline from this balance more than 5 Gt to be achieved until 2020 the stabilisation of climate control on 2 degrees of Celsia to make it possible to exclude that it does not happen outside control.
95% energy is split in the form of temperature and rest, including 5%, the light product.
The consumption of energy reduces 75% and with new DEL shoes, we reduce this consumption twice.
Fluo-compact shoes are held in average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new DEL, the taxis that carried this week to the production of Philips - this company has been fully participated in the United Nations study - have a preliminary life of 25,000 hours and needs 80% less energy than the required demand, which gives us a presentation of the potential business plan of replacement that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new challenges can also work with the rest and smooth less temperature.
And they don't contain any shoes.
Some experts have expressed outcome for fluo-compact shops because they contain the rubber and have to be established as a dangerous accident, which is not yet possible in developing countries, as if the manufacturers would make collections.
In particular, as the report indicates, the main source of emissments on the planet is not a fluo-compact cheese, but almost the dark electricity that makes a lot of cuttings necessary for the production of electronic energy cutting in the required requirements.
Only in the United States, these centres are offered for 25,000 tons last year.
The report also provides details of cycles from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would take such a billion of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 technology electricity, which would cost 2.5 billion
The front of the slonium expects the results of the choice results.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested an immediate publication of the results of the President's elections in the Season Season after the expiration of the specified period.
"The Secretary-General ensures the need for the independent election committee to complete his work and note the provisional results of the United Nations speaker."
"All parties in the Season and the institutions in order to prove their sense for responsibility and to maintain any initiatives until the report of the provisional results."
Even through the pressures issued by some foreign governments, the Commission had allowed the election to apply the most crucial date - the Middle-Nord - without publishing the results, three days after the weekly delay.
Forty-four minutes before the expiration of the ECI President in the TV confirmed that the Commission was "continuing in the work" to report the results.
In the middle of the world , the CEI has increased excuses to finally announce the name of the winning of the second round, between Laurent Gbagbo and the member of the opposition of Alassan Ouattar.
But the camp Gbagbo agrees to annulation of the Statutive Council for the "dwight" voting on the north, which has been conducted by the new army (FN) from a successful State Transfer in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Chairman of the President's election campaign in the North of Slonovine, confirmed that the fears of the volcators who practiced the FN (New Army) in the north country were repeated by the representative of the President of the Sea Slonovine from to vote.
Options may be cancelled if the Statute Council had looked at the gravity that Gbagbo had given.
Instead, the president Gbagbo has that the highest Court of the country is not neutral because Paul Yao N'Dre, a very close political association of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattar, a person from the north, who declares any connection with the old surveys, refused to hold in the report of the results as "acceptable" and requested Gbagba to respect them, but not so far that he would need a victory.
His connections confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered losses and that it is to be courageous to the Statute Council after he carried out the election committee to exceed the results, it would be unlawful.
The second role of the President's elections in the week was considered to be considered as a corruption of the re-union process and the reduction of the country, which has already been divided for two half years.
The United Nations warned in the middle of the political fractions of the Season, that it could be responsible for accidental violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first role of October 31, as the winning of 38% of voting for Alassana Ouattar, which has received the public support of the elder president Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first role).
The migration of unemployment remains stabil in France in the third quarter year.
The independence measure in France in the meaning of the word according to the International Working Agency (BIT) remained stabilly at 9.3% in the metropolitical France (9.7% including the sea areas), as indicates the provisional data with the correction of Section Development (CVS), which published INSEE in the fourth century.

Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment insurance since 2006, and it is the field of its calculation method.
Eurostat, the Statistic Agency of the European Union, however, continues in the processing of month statistics and in the outcome announced 9,8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9,9% was done in September.

Attachment Clotilde Reiss: Elysian ball overcome the media Serbia
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reiss, young research workers arrested in Iran because of the "Spionage", he convocated the opinions in France, introduced diplomacy to the battle capacity and submitted relations between Paris and the Teheran.
All of this has been watched by diplomas from the United States.
American documents, obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, disappear some of this crisis.
They describe how Elisai palack explained his American strategy as far as far as far as he gave them advice to control such cases in Iran (a small east group).
They show how the French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young France was not compensed against the liberty of Majida Kakavanda, Iran prisoner in France and the American justice for understood trade with materials in the use of the Iran Nuclear Programme.
Finally, they describe the light of the way the French President tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Klotildy Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything for that.
Diplomatic telegram held on 12 August 2009 in Paris has a title: "Iran:francouse comments for the solution in the case of manufactures."
Advisor of the Elisei Palestine for Strategic Affairs, Francois Richier, conducted Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Central East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American diploma of Allgrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They allow the Americans to do the same as the same to be replaced to their own national companies by the forces held in Iran.
"Have a smoke," says they, "not yet steady to say" in the medical words "the basic rights of the human," "unbelieving", "almost freedom."
It needs to be brought to an irany mode, citoy to his image.
"Do it more than they'll ask you to stop it."
Because the trials have been tried to deal with the discreet channels, "the silence doesn't resolve anything," the Irans are "the towns of the smoking manivers."
Mr. Richier reminds that the interaction of strangers is "Iran's family tactics: the doors of hands for the purposes of "political education".
It notes that the freedom of Klotildy Reiss (which is present on 16 August, on the day when the French Ambassade is offered to it) "requests to pay high financial parts to the Iranians" (amount 230 000 euros).
And she reports that Elisei's pale is an anticipation of cases with hands, phenomenon, who's going to be watched.
"In the future, the Iranians could lock the other cities of 1800 French lives in Iran," says.
28th Silver 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is wide: Iran Majid Kakavand, which the United States announce that it was issued for the illegal trade with the electronic material in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on freedom based on the judge decision.
America's majority as well as many observers ask for this concerned occurrence.
For Washington, which seeks an illegal Iran network to obtain material for nuclear programmes, is the crash of Majida Khakavanda a bad report.
France's coming to the convention?
Liberation of Iran for the freedom of young French?
On the next conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, Francois Richier ensures that it's not.
The Elisei's pale, as he says, was not only "the judge's decision" but looked for the opportunity to stand against it.
"The debates between the President's office and the Minister of Justice" (in that time, Michelle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judgment decision."
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Mayid Kakavand is under "limited" monitoring French reporting services.
The advice of the Elisei pallace is a phone number, encounters the telephone audience and then reports the American diplomat that Iran is currently in Paris's buildings of Iran's managers."
In the prison of Klotildy Reiss in Iran, Elisai's packaging, exempting, through communications and organised "unions" in the Mediterranean, to convince that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays "conscious" and "involved" role "mediator".
The Americans observe this activities without iron and believe that manipulation gives its fruit, since some of the articles in the press are reforming the French official version.
The telegram from August 25, 2009 increases the medical "blot" of French officials.
At which such a "Thanks" peace, exclaimed by M. Assado, is asked for a majority in Paris.
"And through their pronouncement, the French officials in particular recognize that they have only a warranty imagination of what the Syrians have done in fact."
The document will then be concerned with reasons that the Elisei's packack used to pay in this field.
Intensive communication "meets to validate the policy of the President Sarkozi's opening from Siria," analyzes.
Political applied in 2008 "the number of critical voices were observed in France and in the frontiers and marked as a timely and unemployed."
This is, "How to move the Syrian role," Paul trys to demonstrate Siria, whose glorious man can serve when he plays a constructive role in the area."
The goal is also "declining the ceremonies of the unconsciousness between Siria and Iran."
The American ambassade knows that with a very good source.
11 August, Francois Richier said to him, "We certainly don't know if the Syrians have done anything, that's whatever."
"But we thanked them."
"It should be at least to enter the smoke and the poorness between Iran."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkoza accepts her in the Elisei pale.
In the community, thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Siria for their "active role in help of delivering our country."
End on-line her after the north for young Korea
The South Korean government will adopt the law called "Pecival" which will prohibite the adolescents to play online games after the north, because he blocks access to them, they brought responsible government actions.
The proposal of the law will be presented to the Parliament in prostinct to request online games to lock access to these games after the half of the 16 years of younger persons, the representatives of the Ministry and the Ministry for the family.
"A lots of children play these games all night and then have problems with teaching in school and they are not able to take normal life for the day."
"We have that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," reported AFP Jo Rin, leader of the Ministry, who has a proposal for the law for care.
On-line games will be new accessible from 6 hours tomorrow.
The Community will have one year to prepare the law to apply.
The Government also suggests that the company requires to limit the period of access to these young games for the parents requesting this, he completed the responsible worker.
It also gives the available people who ask it, urgent programmes, allowing them to limit time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "posted" countries and the day pressure brings regularly different facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The earth is likely an insufficient mystery in world conventions in online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medails on World Cyber Games, and it faces in the face of 58 other nations.
The world's mistery in the years 2018-2022: Fifa establishs a hostial country.
Full challenges due to corruption, the Executive Committee establishs the Fifa Committee in the quarter of the world's homeland in 2018 and 2022, the election of politically motivated policy, where the fight against influence and lobbing risks that the technical criteria exists.
It is sure that the Royal Court of Fifa in 2018 will be held in Europe , traditional bathroom of this disciple (4 candidates: English, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands).
The Mistery in 2022 will be more exotic, including the International Federation hopes that it will be given to a new field (Qatar, Australia) after the African Continent in 2010, or continue to continue in the United States or East (Japanese, South Korea).
List of personalities participating in the delegation framework (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Kathara, Governing Affairs of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham and Cruyff) gives the possibility to create a representation of economic and political measures in the world.
In the school of risks, they'll stay until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to set the hierarchies in accordance with the candidates.
According to the evaluation reports of Fifa, English, Spanish and Portuguese documentation (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
However, these reasons will not be too large for 22 members of the Executive Commission in the hour of voting.
Sunday Times, on the beginning of the beginning, leader to suspend two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Themarii and Amos Adam), may have destroyed the chance of his country, the collibs, which were still hosted by the world's championate only one year.
The BBC has set the core on the Sunday when she has broken the document that has "pick up on the board" three influential members of the CE (European Commission), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatoa.
How to do Fifa unfairly and bring to hate English leadership with David Cameron in the first order.
The Chairman of the Government hopes that he will be able to repeat the tattoo that his leader made in the function of Tony Blair in 2005, which had been able to receive for the London Olympian Organization in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to add the new bottle to his name in the European Commission?)
Nothing is less sure because the two Spain-Portugal has no trunks already prepared by stations, her welcome (The World Shampionate in Spain, the Olympic Game 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their photobal culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of both countries could be given to these ambitious branches.
The adverse measures against the English and the doubts of the payment of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outside and through spaces in its documentation (stations, hotels, rights).
However, the President of the Government Vladimir Poutin decided that mystery would not be able to come to Curique and published publicly “a complete competition in the preparation of voting” in the words of the fulfillment of English pressure against the Members of the CE (European Commission).
"We'll have a house behind them, we'll try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For the year 2022, it appears to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experiences since 1994.
The most highest economy in the world, the capital sponsors of Fifa, seems that this country has a great smoking before Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidates seem to be temporarily for both countries that together in 2002 were sold "seek".
Another threat: the world's mysteriousness of 2026 China, which was holidayly over Fifa, made a Asian chance for 2022 untail.
With Katarm, who went out of the hand of the big thing in the form of futuristic stations, and Australia, to continue Fifa in its expansion to new countries, but these two countries represent more risks than safe.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, would be able to pick up for the chat TV (for the reason of time-second) placed European countries, creating the hibber power for Fifa.
Second Mandate: Remote (remote)
De Gaulle really wanted.
Mitterrand resurrected that he's worried.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't worry at the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
The sender of Elisei's palea calls someone else.
The current head of the State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But obviousness is not in a good agreement with the part of the secrets associated with the Presidency function.
So it's going to do, as if it's not even overcome.
In the same way, in the other way.
In 2006, who would like to believe that, friends Jacques Chiraca made a suggestion that the third mandate would not be excluded.
On November 15, with a serious expression Nicolas Sarkoza confirmed that "It will be decided at the end of 2011."
As Remembers the UMP members of the UMP in the middle of the evening in Eliseo, the perspective of "two Mandats" has reached a little hot state.
Was it the official announcement of his candidate?
He wasn't far away from that.
The President only reminded that the amendment of the Agency in 2008 limited the number of fifty-fifty functional periods to two.
It was just his side of constatation, not not an announcement.
It's not the first time she reminds such a humor tone of the President's choices.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and half years before me," he proceeded in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010, "Don't think I'm not thinking about another etap."
His previous expressions will not make it a candidate more than the past day; he will not make it a candidate even less.
If they call comments, it's due to two truths.
Quickness to the candidate to the PS, on one side.
But this isn't the income to the Segolén Royal, which touchs Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
It is also because his candidate in 2012 is evident that many of the PS want to coordinate in war meetings almost prior to the thought.
Bad investigation on the other side.
First, the right choice would prefer the candidate of Francoise Phillon before Nicolase Sarkozyho (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss this thing with the UMP," they responded immediately and immediately and reflected people from the nearest road of the Government President.
"If you believe the potential traitor, you won't condemn it," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe that he can win," adjusts Alain Jupee, equipped with clarity.
Euro: The Central European Bank is urgent to continue in its purchases of State titles.
The last meeting of the Centre Governors Council in the year had to be the opportunity to fulfil the conditions for carrying out of the crisis or at least notifying a large number of non-normal monetary operations that should be finished until the end of this year.
The European Research Crisis consists of, the institution for the exposure of price papers will not be able to be so category under the painting of the situation, which is already written on European markets with the price papers.
The political price would be higher in such cases.
Yesterday, in the opportunity of printing the France Ministry of Finance Christine Lagarde, the hold of a active role playing the Central European Bank in the effort of resolving the crisis of investigation of the European States.
She didn't want to say if she thinks that the bank could do more, for example, to increase their programme of purchased obligations.
"I appreciate my attention for my European partners (...)."
On the evening, in Brussels, at its consultation of the Commission for the economic and monetary matters of the European Parliament, President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been considered as clearer in the case of its purpose, and has been satisfied that the programme of purchasement of State titles on the secondary market is "procured" and that "we see how we will decide" during the meeting that is focused on this fourth year.
The only safeguard: the Central European Bank will look at its basic unchanged rate to 1%, its historically less than May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of obligations from the competent bank of the Central European Bank were doubled at least 1,35 billion eur in the last week.
And thanks to the unbecoming agreements on the market, new Ireland and Portuguese obligations have done yesterday.
The total eurosystem banks purchased 67 billion billion billion from May 2010.
In the middle of adjustments on the market of anticipation on the continuing of the purchases, there are no doubts (see page 29).
Economies don't expect a significant change of the course.
If the operation of the currency for more than three months has already been disappeared from the Central European Bank, this recently named bank shall be accessed to non-limited delivery of liquid media in accordance with large conditions and a period of a week to three months.
Economic hopes today that this mechanism will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that it would change a significant way of my programme."
"If not, it would mean to take the risk of choice of a short-code new inflation," says Michael Schubert, the commercebank economy.
"A progressive east reported during the first quarter of 2011 seems likely to be more likely," predicted Norbert Brüms, an economy at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In order to plan its intervention on the market, "the European Central Bank should hold both its obligations to survive the sustainable market," links Norbert Brüms.
With regard to the exposition of European banks on the markets, the euro area has no more choice than keeping its existence on the market.
"He needs for each price to replace the losses of investors on the market and to act in such a way to refuse the replacement of the placed outcomes of the States concerned among the most fair," proved yesterday a significant manager of obligation.
Because if the measures have been flown, the states will be more trained to reduce their debts, instead of stabilizing it.
It's a safe euro for this price.
In Italy, the Government of Berlusconi
After the beginning of the week, Italia was a little worried situation yesterday with the return of obligations for 10 years.
Return to a temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Ministry for Economy of the Chairman regions said that Giulia Tremonti had heard how to qualify situations as "incertainable" and expecting "invisible" weekend, and then delegated.
In each case, in the absence of the long-term German steps, the record of 210 basic points and the price of contracts on the crisis against bankrot risk (CDS) was exceeded to 263 points, which was made in Rome a certain disruption.
In the Council of the Ministry Silvio Berlusconi noted that the department with German measures in Spain was higher than 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Lett, told him that he was "increased" "the weight of markets" and that might be the origin of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The wrong report is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economy in Hudson Institute.
Of course and not encrypted, its problem is absence of growth and non-explicit fishing inputs, which are hands in hand and makes it risks that it will not be able to cause its financing needs.
The last prognoses of Brussels were for the Government of the Student Spring.
The Italian growth has been expected to 1,1% in 2011 and 1,4% in 2012... while it is available to the Senat to his analysis, at 1,3% and 2%.
For these conditions, the European Commission shall calculate the deficit of public finances to provide more 4,3% of the huge home product in the next year (in contrast to 3,9% of the proposed Government) and 3,5% in 2012 (in addition to 2,7%).
From there a report on the new summary of additions to the proposal of a State budget that could be carried out after the feasts, up to 7 billion euros.
"If it is necessary, new essential measures shall be adopted," the Commissioner values the economic interests, Olli Rehn.
For this time, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are all right and its calculations are right, we repeat it for a long time," ensures Arrigo Sadun, Italian Administrative Board of the International Monetary Fund under the button of Italy on the International Middle Fund.
"No timely problem, no short-code or long-term problem here, because through its significant duty (119,2% of the huge home product in 2011, NDLR), is the effort for stabilization required in Italy less than the efforts required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the main Economic Economic.
The rest of the political instability question.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will take place the proposal for the untrustedness of the Poland's dream, and afterwards, they may begin to organize the options with which it is referred to at the end of March.
It would start so long, less appropriate to adopt decisions in the case of serious crisis.
The Europeans think about the exposure of protectry mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde remarked it yesterday in the print conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans demonstrated it in the week of the whole day and night, they are obviously very solidary decisions, anxiety to protect their changes and their mixed area."
Although it is all related, yesterday's expansions related to the European State obligation, it brought water to milk governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization.
The Office for notes Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade the record of Portuguese duty, objectives on which most are measured by various specializations.
"Therefore in May is really increasingly transparent and appearing to the policy, especially on bank systems," says Exane BNP Paribas.
More about that, "the political time runs shorter than the market time."
This interrupted conformity and dangers which hide intensify the European country's debate, which is directed to ensure existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Financial Ministry, the most concerned of the data issue, and in the largest measure with their G20 trackings, are very well developed.
This is regarding the meetings of the Euroscupin (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin meeting since the beginning of the next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is fulfilled today.
The programme is responsible for non-conventional measures on the support of the eurozones with market measures (see above).
In the case of the European Financial Fund (FESF), his Executive Director, Klaus Regling, in Singapur, was able to inform investors from the continuous East of Crisis Development in Europe.
If this path is not a goal to increase the funds, it is prepared for the achievement of this target.
The first Emission of Precision Papers of the FESF is considered at the next month.
Yesterday, the American official representative declared Agent Reuters that the United States will support the potential of mobilised financial measures in addition to the FMI.
The country in the first section, Portugal and Spain are prepared for structural reforms, especially on the organisation of the work market.
Reforms associated with the appropriate measures with rapid effect.
Lisabon and Madrid are other ways than using Greece and Ireland.
Both countries would like to exceed each price that they would request international assistance before implementing their own budget corrections and decided on structural reforms necessary to reach their trust.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about the options available to accelerate the market normalization process with higher obligations.
At his journey to Party 24 November, Axel Weber came with a thought whether 750 billion euros were mobilised by the European and the International Monetary Fund would not be able to reach the resources of price papers.
Economic from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the first trade plan with European extents, judges that the additive of £100 billion billion would supply, "come" is the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The average exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisty Mechanism, which is carried out to this day 60 billion euros.
The Council, which has all the chances to be tested in Europe's main cities.
Especially when the market conditions were worse.
Snow and sky: 24 countries have an ornamental property.
The Snow Advantages are still able to achieve difficulties, especially on the forces of the second class in the United Kingdom, and there is risk that some economic activity can be raised.
Twenty-four periods are now prepared for the risk of snow and disease.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Duux-Sevres and la Vienne, have been connected to 20 periods that have already been published by the Oriya's preparation, 18 already from the Middle Monday and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde later night.
According to the Meteo France, the significant advantages of the snow cause the problems in the north of the Gironde and the Carentes and the slowness of the Ile-de-France.
The sneeping steel from 2 to 5 cm, locations from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the intervals of 1 to 3 cm, locations to 5 in Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the period of Basse-Normandie, Ille-de-France and Limousin.
The dreams are too big to make difficulties in order to deal with some economic activities, predicts Meteo France.
On the border of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have passed with a hard cost-country - cost cars over 7,5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac.
The motor carrier on the other classs in the United Kingdom is very difficult and the police recommends to go out with his vehicle only if it is really necessary and the driven of some stones was broken for this day.
In Picardia, the school connections were prohibited to fourth.
In the middle of the evening there are no special measures for the restrictions of cost transport.
The period Office "commits all car drivers to the biggest care on motors and to facilitate car rental equipment."
The General Civil Airport Directorate (DGAC) requested a flying company to avoid 25% of their years on the Paris airport Roissy and 10% in Orly for the reason of expected dreams.
DGAC recommends the traveling services using aeroplane, to connect to its company.
In the Great Britain, Gatwick is closed to the fourth ran to the south of London and the airport in Edinburgh in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: First financial proposals
From the time it's discussing the modernization of transport on Ile-de-France in full-production, first billion.
At least during the discussion.
We remember, especially, 23 billion in a Grand Paris meter, which must set the society of the Grand Paris.
In order to be launched, he announced the state of an offering for 4 billion euros.
Clearly theoretically is a quantity that then the SGP company allows to use for the prohibitions of financing part of its two resources.
We're finally achieved to the first additives today.
The Reactive Act on Financial Financial Committee of the International Conference from 2010 contains mechanisms set out in order to ensure these means.
There are two: creation of special data from exhaustion and increased data from officers on Ille-de-France.
First, let's read in the proposal of the law, article 15, means "the public institutions of the Social Du Grand Paris."
It's calculated, "the winning of this stage is 117 million euros a year."
The second is the rebuilding of the staff for a officer already existing, therefore, "so it would be modernized to increase the increase of it and to increase this increase in the society of the society of the Grand Paris."
How much would it get out?
- Shut up.
It's not calculated in the text.
We've got 4 billion far away.
"It is stated that these fishing resources are connected to 4 billion euros from capital demands that will be mobilized by the State and entered into the society of the Social Du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in the explanation of reasons.
This system doesn't seem smoking in the SGP company.
"On the moment we created receipts (other data), we can hide studies for three years and then play to 4 billion, explains it here."
"It's going to be started in the budget and used for the needs."
The SGP Community provides that 4 billion will be added to 2013 for the budget for 2014.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promised, is still inadequate abominants, risks that it calls for a rushing Parliament's debate.
The first public meeting will be 7 December.
Miscellaneous hackers and caused auditors
The case of WikiLeaks has two significants.
On the one hand, there is a clear skandal, which seems to be a skandal faced only in the face of the poorness that is guided by relations between States, cities and prints.
On the other hand, it takes the deep changes on international level and prevents the future of controlled regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is the confirmation of the fact that each document established by a secret service (all nations) is exhausted from print scarts.
"Exterior deficit" Americans on the way of the sexual life of Berlusconi is that every month has been reading in some news (all other than these two Berlusconi own), and the difference of the carictural profile of Kadafi was already long for the charitable subject for the sheet.
The rule, according to which secret documents are able to sit down only from the reports already known, is essential in the dinamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the book which is conducted by the ezotherical literature, you will see that every work is repeated (o Graal, Office of Rennes-le-Charteau, Templars or Zednachers) exactly what was written in previous works.
And it is not only because the author of the Occultic texts doesn't pay for new information (no know where to look for not existing), but because those who are cultists believe in what they already know and what they have learned before.
It's a mechanism of the success of Dana Brown.
It also pays for secret documents.
The informator is strict, and the leader of the secret services (and if it is not, it may be as I know, editor in new Liberation), which is based on the truth only what he is accepted.
Information with a high exhibition on Berluscoim, which has sent the United States resources, were those who published Newsweek a week ago.
Why, then, was it so much to be taken around these documents?
On one side they say what every cultured person already knows, and because the majority, at least from the end of the second world war, and from the time when the heads of the states can phone or leave the airport to the party, lost their diplomatic function, and, except some small challenges in the representation, were transformated into the Spion Center.
Any wonder that looks for research films very well knows that it's just ignored from a lot of rate.
However, the fact that it repeats publicly, heavy responsibility of corruption and brings it a bad light to American diplomacy.
Second, the thought that any hacker can get the most attempted information of the most powerful country of the world represents a serious field, not even unresolved, for the presence of this State reserve.
Scandal influences as victims, as well as his "agency".
But let's go out to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in the time of Orwell, it was possible to take all the powers like some Big Brother who controlled each move of his people.
Orvello’s prophecy was declared since the time that the possibility of controling every motion by the phone, each transaction, the visited hotel, the remote remote, and then, has been achieved by the requested victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how this is now, that even the "shirts" with the most secreted information of power can't achieve the stock of some hacker, it's stopped to be the control report alongside and becomes a victim.
The power controls every citizen, but every resident, or at least the hacker - selected as a member of the citizens - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you keep the power that has no ability to keep his own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simel has already said that the real secret is an independent secret (and the unexpected secret will never be able to be received); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Mercel is actually secret because it is taken from the public life; but discharge, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were unrestricted, meaning all the powers of him.
WikiLeaks did no mistake in Sarkozy or Mercel, but did something to the big Clinton and Obam.
What will the consequences of this suffered power be so significant?
It is obvious that in the future States, they will not be able to send online citizen information - it would be equal to her publication on the platform broken on the road of the street.
But it is also obvious that the current technologies are sufficient to hope that they can keep in the phone reports.
It's nothing easier than to find whether and when the head of the state was traveling with the aircraft and associated with some of their colleagues.
How can they be saved in the future in the challenges of private and civil reports?
Well, I know that for this time there's prognoses to science-fiction, and then it's fantastic, but I have to imagine government actions that are transforming discriminatively implementation after non-controlled transports and bring only the reports that are known to remember or even hide severe information in the subject of the boot.
Information will be stored in unixed copies in closed keys: totally taken, trying to spione in Watergate had been less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology now moves the side before, that means back.
One hundreds later, when a telegraph signed revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on travels (telephonicals).
Video chats (analogs) have allowed the lovers to dream the film a step after a step, put it back and take it down and discard all the secrets of the mountain, while now the CD (numericals) can only shoot after chapters, it means by macroforms.
In the middle of the speeds, we're going from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the airport and transport that we need three and half hours.
It is therefore not amazing that political and communication technology are returned to the cars cut off horses.
Last note.
Yindy tried to understand what happened in my secret.
Now it's a great spectacle that requires confidential information from the pressure.
Climate: as France hacked his promises on financing
The year after the Code Agreement is the time to try to maintain the promises on quickly blocked funding (reasoned funding with fast start (fast start) or prior), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were departed
In the Codean Agreement, the growth countries took place for $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised 7,2 billion € for three years and France 1,26 billion € (that is 420 billion per year).
On the beginning of COP16, the EU has made a great assets to convince his partners about the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: report to exhibit the actions of its Member States, the press conference, the big side event, the brochure distribution...
The transparency operation is unreasonable and assessed to their real value: growing countries and citizenship would like to make them all growing countries and society the same and the same way.
The EU states that in 2010 2,2 billion € was released to the right path to maintain its promise in 2012.
But if we turn to detail, we will find that things are much more complicated.
These financial measures are "new and additional" in accordance with the Codean Agreement to ensure that the increased sustainance is achieved and that it would not be to renew public development assistance.
God, there's no agreement in the meaning "new and additional."
While the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, between others and France, were blocked.
Today, everybody chooses the reference that makes him the best.
For example, the European Commission considered reference 2009: the international financing has been maintained and it adds 150 million for three years of the financial title of fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or terms on the level of public development assistance.
Instead, France is that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
Furthermore, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous period or to the global level of public aid for the development of AIDS public to development.
Especially, the total higher support of France in the developing countries can remain increasing (or even reducing), has to maintain its obligation to finance "new and additional "...
The next element decided is the distribution of gifts and feeds.
There is no rule there yet, and each one chooses his own type of calculation.
Some, for example, France, think that $1 is equal to $1.
Obviously, it's hard to show: the chance is not equal.
If the use of the investment may be added to some retailed investments (with a project related to reduction of emissions in more efficient technologies), it is difficult to present one euro that we get as an equivalent euro that we give... we should not understand it from the title of our obligations, but as a price for the trusting country (e.g., e. e. rate measures).
However, France can only give this reason: "He keeps" his obligation to 420 million euros, which makes 91,5% billion (389,8 million eur) and 8,5% of gifts (36,1 million €) - see the EU document that you can check it yourself.
It is the only Union country that uses the ground in such a measure.
Germany requested 46%, while Danish, Netherlands or Slovakia (other countries) hold their obligations to 100% of gifts.
Otherwise, when most of the European Union offers 1 € in the framework of its promise, France gives only 10 centimeters and considers this trial as comparable.
That's a beautiful kitchen!
For the agreement, in its financing "fast start" France, France operates with a two-security: on one side with the development of action in time and on the other hand with real financial affairs.
Although it gives only 36,1 million euros, it can prove that it gives 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to his promises.
The Ministry of Financial Manipulation (for this reason it seems that, although Bercy, who has made such decisions) could have two negative impacts in the EU currently (why would the Member States continue in the donation if it is sufficient to pay?) and in the delegation, because the developing countries are not fully positive...
The primary financing chapter is only a small questionnaire, relatively shortly, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be a song of a song more in a large machine which is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that it's not our case.
As regards whatever, it is necessary to cut out the knowledge of this first year of the provisional financing.
France should first notify a change in its way to lead account evidence for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of maintaining their obligations and integrity and justice in respect of other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France should be discussed about the income to long-financing (other basic chapter in the present discussion): we will not ask the question of "additiveness" or the way of payment.
France should change its positions to be so advanced in these entities as the others.
Finally, all are in the new ministry for the environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizate, which will come to Cancun next week.
The surprised announcements of the fast launch of France and its visibility "addition" and the use of the currency could be able to exceed international confidence, necessary to continue in discussions.
Alarms relating to the pesticides whose children will be lost.
Decades of child will take place on one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this Centre, from the association of the Buddhist Generation (ex-Highness for law and maintaining future generations).
Association, which notes that its results "not a significant statistical value in respect of the low number of analysed models but are characteristics for the processed problem," was buyed between the June and the closed food normally consumed in four foods and one easy food as easy for a child's supermarket in the Oise and Paris.
This typical food, which includes official recommendations - five cups of pure fruit and green, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water in the day - such as sugar, were analysed by research laboratorys on chemical substances, pesticides, hard cows and other pollutants.
81 chemical substances, from 42, are numbered between carcinogenic, possibly or possibly, and five substances are between clear carcinogenic substances, such as 37 substances that may be able to be as mosquies for yellows with internal exchange (PE), according to the study of several institutions such as the International Centre for Research.
"When, at least all cases, legal limits for each chemical substance accepted individually are not exceeded, we see in our research that reality in the exposition of consumers containing substances may be carcinogenic and/or PE is infected," says the association.
In order to snow the meat and the tea with meat contains almost ten residues with potential carcinogenic effects and three proceeded as certain carcinogenes, as well as at about twenty residues, which could abuse the hormonal system.
Jablko, carried out from Brazil, conducted studies as a small switch, contains six chemical substances, except for others, even in France.
It is also paid for the green faxs from Kenya, which are covered to lunch, where the study has shown the levels of strong insects prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the bifth of young meat, the tanks in the woods and even the hair and the eggs were spreaded by pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the waters of the analyze, the presence of spirits and chloroforms was declined.
Steak from the loso to the evening was the "boyest" with 34 invented chemical residues and even the analyzation of the plastic taile used for food in microflow branches was not deleted.
The final risk for consumers of this "cocktail containing substances" is probably highlighted," exceeds from the study.
The Economic Europe-Greening (EEE-LV) proposed "the creation in the face of the situation" to make Moratorium for the use of pesticides to stop "the variety of civilization diseases".
In June, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) studies the present status of the residuation of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and green consumed in Europe, from 76 in cereals.
