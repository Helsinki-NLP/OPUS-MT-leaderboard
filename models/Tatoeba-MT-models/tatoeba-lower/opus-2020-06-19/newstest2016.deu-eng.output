Obama accepted Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just welcome.
The two would like to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the near East.
However, the conflict with Palestinians and the discussioned two States should also be discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has seen years ago.
Washington criticizes the long-term Israel's building, and takes Netanyahu’s missing will in peace process.
The relationship of both of the Iranian Atom Programme has continued to worried by Obama.
On March, Netanyahu had maintained a restricted talk to the Republican invitation before the U.S. Congress, which was part of the affront against Obama.
The talk wasn't talking to Obama, that a meeting had been rejected with indication to the previous election in Israel.
In a notorium, the Professor was to have his girlfriend
In a notorium, Professor Shannon Lamb reported with a loud voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers should come to his house.
The Lamb was important to indicate that his "soul dog" was still living and probably raised, and he said that the family contacts of the dead women could be found on the phone.
In the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentis and a handwritten notice that was crushed on a white block: "I'm so sorry I wanted to reject it, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who loved me." This stood after the details of the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that the Lamb, in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already been traveling 300 miles to the school office, where he had been struck and killed after the policy's details, Ethan Schmidt, on the door to his office.
Delta State University Policies, Lynn Buford, said that the university workers have heard the shoes at 10:18.
He said that the Lamb made the delegated notruf sometimes afterwards.
Before the end of the day, there was another death: Lamm took the life when the police took him.
One day after the shooter in the university, students and dozens to hide closed doors, the authorities still try to make a picture of what the Lamb motivated.
The details published by the experts at two ends of the State, as well as what students and cooperators who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented, but possibly difficult teachers.
Students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Princess died, said he had no story of violence or a criminal story.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, where he mentioned the "wunderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both of them were informed in the division of social sciences and story, which included 17 members, and many students visited the curses of both.
At the same time there were several weaknesses to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who prayed the Lamb, said, he also looked a little upset and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sikes, said that Ramm told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academy year 2014-15.
Lamb had first requested the Delta State University for a review of health reasons and said he had some health problems.
In this year he just teached two online courses.
The most recent changes in the employment policy of the university means that the promotion that he had worked so hard for the Lamb would not show him guarantees for a automatic way to design as a assistent professor.
President of the University William LaForge said that he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "that's sure there was something in Mr. Lambs.
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the flight out of the campus, the police found the Lambs Spur later when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be set, the Lamb killed himself with a 38-caliber pistol in the front of a house, about a half south of his parents' house at the city of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the invasion.
It was not immediately clear why Ram went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grows in the area.
Lamb started 2009 his work at the university who has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and teached geography and pedagogic.
He promotes the morning in Pedagogic.
One of the long-year friends of Lambs mentioned him as smart, charismatic and lucky.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and Lam was 20 when she met a joint friend.
You and her friends were in the High School, and he was the cool old guy who tried to teach you the gitarian game.
He was the woman's worm once.
All girls smile there when he was there," Hairston said, now 40 and in the Jackson President of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentis were obviously some time together.
In the Notruf Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no urgent of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstein house, which limited a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was okay.
The ex-man of Princess, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been history of 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter that was now 19 years old.
" She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb found Princess, when he and Abigail found both on a summer year market for three years ago.
Afterward, they played together the one or another gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentis was a sister who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes a challenge coordinator in the Julep Room, a hardly lighted bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentis night in the evening on 5 September last time after the Lamb had finished his gitar and mouthharmonics game before a spear public.
There was no signs for something wrong.
"It's just a happy couple," he said.
We were on cleaning, and we were kidding each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense for shoes.
Schmidt, the Dead Professor, leaded the first seminar seminar program and specialized on American residents and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a English professor in school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his brothership and the Student Committee.
At Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including dozens, workers, students and members of the community participated in a kern light-level officer.
Schmidts Mrs. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the roomwater, while the university officer "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The training will be taken again on midnight.
"We're trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of health.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Ptoutes in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans brought to this report.
This story was corrected to reply that the police now says that Lamb made the notruf after he had smidt, and that Lamm in his Notruf Prentis was mentioned as his wife, but there is no evidence that they have married each other.

UN Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "No military solution" of nearly five years long conflicts, and more weapons will be destroyed for millions of people.
The United Nations Chair requies all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on the middle of a press conference that he plans to discuss the foreign Minister of the five permanent Member States of the Council - United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France - on the border of the Ministerial Assembly Assembly, still in this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He noted that the assemblies in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Communities "the situation will be unresolved."
Bank requested the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and units that they have demonstrated when they arrived in a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Requests that show that Donald Trump is serious to take.
Some have tried to brand him as a flock.
Others took him as a whistle.
And some waited for a break.
But don't worry how some of the Republicans try to take Donald Trump from the top rounds in consultations below, it has not yet been working.
Ten of the last eleven national reviews showed Donald Trump in a double area, and some began to ask seriously what it means for the possibilities of nomination of the immobilian module.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one says that Trump will probably win the republican nomination.
Experts indicate that Rick Perry's leadership was sent to the upright Herman Cain in 2011, which nobody won only one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But external groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth are now recognized by Trumps Permanent and start to leave their dollars to struggle it.
There are some current reviews that indicate that the immobility module is not only a transitional phase:
Trumps liberty values have turned around 180 degrees.
Before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle June, a question of the Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten republicans had seen the immobilian moul.
It was 40 percent until the middle of July.
In the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Some three of the ten says they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers remain in previous States.
A quinipiac vote in Iowa has stated that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good view of Trump.
Two third parts of the GOP choices would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a question of CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they would be "behaviour" or " satisfied" if Trump would be nominated.
Only two of the 10 says they'd be "hard," if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson makes the same disagreement as Trump (43% says they would be "behaviour" in 40%, which say the same about the Trump).
The next in the case?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican electorals say that they would be "incompatible" or "forgiving" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the stablishment, the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans looks not as a problem.
While Donald Trump is criticised for its bombatic and amazing statements, 52 per cent of the republicans treated the Irish choices that the Immobilian Moull has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is applied in the first country's proposal, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a supercommander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent thinks that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperature does not pass to the white house, so ABC/Post.
Republican electors enjoy the idea.
When they set up their teachers, the Republican electoral Trump for real.
If they are asked who first wins the GOP namement, they say after a question of CNN/ORC from the past week four of ten of ten that Trump is the best weight.
It's a change since the time when four of the end of July's ten set their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete publication: GOP choices were not the clearest cristall cycle in the past.
At this time, in the last cycle, four of the ten republians thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidates Middle Romney.
However, there is a number of GOP choices Trumps campaigns as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered themselves for another candidate, the Trump is almost everybody.
Some experts indicate that the field that is probably intended to lead Trumps, while the anti-trump support is distributed on more than a thousand other candidates.
But a question of the Monmouth University in the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetic head-an-head row between Trump and most of the other republican candidates, Trump has the majority of support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris 33 points.
It's a head-an-head ring with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who smokes him?
Ben Carson would overcome the undertaker with 19 points in a hypothetical head-an headline.
A small majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says that they have imagined their opinion.
A new question of CBS/NYT on Sunday shows that only a few more than half of the choices, supporting the Trump, says that they have apologized their voices.
Of course, many can happen to change it, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 percent said that they were opening the door to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other outside, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but the choices who say that they have learned their opinion are so often double for the Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of the introduction.
Since Donald Trump in his election campaign two months ago called invitors from Mexico "Affairs" was the introduction of draft and angle point in the public discussion in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombatic expressions of Trump will be held from the Republic Party and will be concerned with the new orientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post question of the Monday, six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump in questions of the introduction.
So while the invasion remains in the ramplight, Donald Trump will also be done.
The Frustration on the Government is cutting on new maximum conditions.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the half of the support of republic elections, especially through their external state.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday Review of ABC/Post, they would like to be a political outside than someone with government experience.
And they're also weak in Washington.
A question of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated on the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 per cent "income" and 21 per cent "health."
Munchen, Silt and Co.: The five exclusive goods of Germany
Here's the worst apartment - looking on the North Sea Watt.

But good, who can lead it...
Eventually, the munchen is not in the spitze.

"We're not going to understood them," Philip Lahm had promised the Bayer Captain of Bayern Lahm before the game in Karaiskakis City before 31.688 heavy fans - and the municipalians held the word.
They showed a concentrated and enhanced imagination without to smoke.
Pireus wind his last six home games in the King class, including against the tiny clubs such as Manchester United, Atletico Madrid or Juventus Turin.
2011 stole here also Borussia Dortmund (1:3).
However, the Bayers, in seven European cup duils with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageously ran into their open efforts, but often too unable to work.
The attacks were too often attached by a game transfer on the left-side Douglas Costa, which has passed out against the previous braunchway Omar Elabdellaoui.
Muller had more happy from the right side of the right field in the top left toreck.
In the 67 minutes, the master of the world left the possibility of 2:0.
The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when the Olympia's Storms Ideye Brown struck the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct absence, the Torwart Roberto parked with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayers raised their dominant game, Pireus Nadelstich could set.
On the gate, Manuel Newer was lost.
As soon as he had a shock of ideay over the latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola left a fourth ketch with David Alaba in the center near Jerome Boateng, which made it well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the box, first sitting out.
The WM-heel has only given green light after the endstreining, said the Sportvorstand Matthew Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else from it, it is already bad."
In the first move, Guardiola decided to be against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attached Lewandowski (59).
Goatze came later for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made 13 minutes later all clear, by elf meters set the mouller again.
Before the game, it came to crawlen in the station.

At least one Bayern-Fan was carried out from the station.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk to lose dens
He who smokes is not only the long, but also the dents - that is putting near a long-term study.
The good news: The risk is quickly.
Rauchers have a clearly high risk to lose their dentiests early.
This results from a long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIFE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-shirts, the risk was to lose their dentiests before, in order to higher the 2.5 to 3.6 fashion.
The scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main reasons for the accident are carriers and disturbations of the dining flesh, the DIFE.
For these parodontitis is a risk factor, the authors becoming.
Thus, the relationship between smokes and smoke loss is returned to sometimes of the dining feeding in the smokes.
Don't be clear, how farmers also increase the risk for Caries.
People who have stopped the smoking could reduce their risk in short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could continue over ten years until the danger reaches the level of non-shirts, the first author Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham.
You need to convince people of being non-shooters, the studio leader Heiner Boeing of the DIFE: "Wooochen's life time is deceived."
Not to smile is good for long and ships and brings us to a good dental health to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 per cent of the population involved in 65 to 74 years of age, the DIFE shared.
Research investigations had already stated that the rabbits increased the risk of the previous deceit.
The new long-term studies cut down the funds.

The EU Commission proposes a new Court of Justice in combating the TTIP
In order to discover the fight on the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission proposed an extent reform of the current jurisdiction system.
The restricted private detention organisations for combating between concerts and States shall then be separated by a transparency system, which is clearly more traditional judgments in its functionality.
"We want to set a system to trust the citizens," the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström explained to the proposal.
Sweden proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position to the free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German Government informed support.
Through TIP, the largest free trade area of the world is 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current smooth procedures are particularly suggested that the EU and the United States are selecting a new court of investment.
They must be the same parts of the EU, the United States and the third countries.
The preview is also a second instance for the first time.
She would allow it to exalte against urgent imprisonment.
Before the procedural participants were confronted to the challenges, there was no independence against their rules.
In the discussion of the past months, the citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
A long time she wants to work on a International Investment Court according to its own information.
For example, there can also be clarified conflicts between Chinese enterprises and EU States.
In particular, the investors' shipping procedures (ISDS) requested by major concerts shall be one of the main fundamentes for great resistance in Europe against TIP.
Traditional courts are criticised by genocides as a kind of parallel rights, and the companies can exceed the smoking of the steward numbers, exceed national laws, or apply to a range of consumers and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TIP organizations such as campaigns are not sufficient for the proposals of the EU Commission.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Economic Secretary Mattias Macnig (SPD) refers to the plans to be a great progress.
The Commission focuses on the reform of essential points that the Minister Sigmar Gabriel has developed in the morning with other EU manual ministers.
The old system of private shoes is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Employment BusinessEurope warned to limit the capacity of economics through a lot of new rules.
In particular, small and medium companies could be published by this, it was said.
When the conversation on the Free Trade Agreement (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it continued to be clear on the Mediterranean.
The negotiations run from the middle of 2013.
However, the subject of investors protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should be the end of this year.
This date is applicable as no longer.
Delikaters people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on the bown in the Kölner Prime Club (or today: Luxor).
Besides him, a flipchart, on which the most efficient people recorded the Malesian US Michigan with fishing steel.
The whole public, about 40 people, is nearly adopted by Steven's proposal.
He says about the various places he's always drawn back on the card, reporting about his ministry and hard arranged songs.
Where they are standing and how it looks there, in his house.
Seither shows Stevens as a wonderful creative Irrer.
With the 2003 published and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears smart composed songs that are very harmonicly close to the American people of the late six, but every time can be able to smoke in a great opulent dream.
It understands that "Michigan" would be the first part of a movement series: each of the 50-year-year-old States should be visited.
However, 2004 and in Rhein nearby has already appeared "Seven Swans" and has obtained positive expectations.
Reduced to Stevens here.
Live is enough for him Gitarre and Banjo.
One year later, the musician who lives in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), 2005 appears to be a flat-endly feededed Masterwork.
Translator to ideas and stylist finces.
The album is raised in the American Billboard Charts and does not have any year's best list of infectious music media.
In addition to productive experiences, Stevens are then intended to "The Age of Adz" (2010) very exciting electronic replacement.
This sixth regular studio album is still largely orchestrated, however, by programmed sequences or beat and plays with all effects and halls.
In the length of the small clubs, the bullshows are here to a huge spectacle from Neon-Sterns and a large fluoressante branches.
Current tours Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-head band through Germany.
In the dark Hamburger More!
Theater represents principally the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although this is now about 2000 hosts sitting in their boards, Stevens returned clearly to intimity and people.
Without a word to the public, the group plays excellent musical by the broad accessible album.
In the public, the proposal is "opurent" and you can remove the "plant in the basis".
First to a add thanks to Stevens, plays akustic less older songs and finally declines under a thousand applaus.
Jeremy Corbyns Debt at the time of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr. Corbyns is expected to be at the time of the Prime Minister with Spanning.
The new Labour President Jeremy Corbyn should give his debt at the time of the Minister's question and make himself first with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will be exalted to make the first six issues of its six proposed issues shortly after the midday, where its distribution of the media is probably been tested and the Labour Agreements of the nearby.
He asked "increasing theaters and more facts" in this weekly event.
He also said that he could overcome some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The agreement will be the first parliamentary test for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after its name to the member of the shadow cabinet and after its talk on the TUC year old at the Sunday.
In the mid-time, the decision of the Labour's pre-procedure, during the meaning of the National Hymne at a dream of the 75th year of the Battle of British, has made the criteria of a number of Tory MPs and is in the mid-point of several title pages story in the magazines.
Mr. Corbyns decided not to sing the National Hymne, he had taken attention to himself.
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had been "in respective silence" and he recognized the "Heldentum of the Royal Air Force in the aircraft around England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyns Schattenkabinet, Owen Smith, reported in the BBC Two Newsnight program, he had invited the Labour President to sing the National Hymne, "independent" by his faith that the monarchie should be achieved.
There are thousands of Shatten Ministry rejected to serve Mr. Corbyn's Spitzenship, and they call to different differences in the economic, protection and external policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliament's Party's party supporting him originally as leaders.
The Politic Corresponder of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also within the labour "stapeln" and that Mr. Corbyns' expressions on the position of the European Union and the restriction of wines.
Mr. Corbyn said to the TUC Conference that the changes of the Labour are essential to remove the whole idea of a total limit.
A few hours later Mr. Smith, the Smith Works and Renten Ministry, said that the party is "come clear" that it is only against the government plans to send the limit of 26,000 £ to 23,000 £.
Mr. Corbyn will be the Fifth Labour President, David Cameron, since he is Tory Chef, in the last decade of the Dispatch Box in the Parliament.
The Labour President, who promised another policy approach, says that he had "Crowd-source" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and had been given to him more than 30,000 reviews.
The Islington North MP said that the questionnaires of the Prime Minister are contractive, and that he also will be raised in the "function" and the fights with resistance, and instead he has focused on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the needs for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the sweet economic Ministry, will represent him if he does not share - for example, if Mr Cameron is in the outside.
He also made the ideas that other colleagues often have received the word, and that John Bercow, the speaker of the subhuman, has spoken to discuss the problem.
When he was leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle Theaters", which often relates to the time of the Minister's question, but after a few years he dreamed that he had given it.
Since it was first sent in the television in 1990, the issuestudy with the Prime Minister was considered the major barometer of the court of a leader and his manager in the underway and his position under his Parliament's colleagues, although critics were argued, they became a caricature and needed widely reforms.

Pfund is increased by an estimated growth in the United Kingdom
The pound grew up to the data showing a growth in the growth of the United Kingdom. Parallel to this, the FTSE 100 was increased by the order of SABMiller.
between May and July, the results of non-boni in the United Kingdom increased 2,9% in the same year.
This percentage was the fastest and achieved estimates on the date of a rate increase since 2009.
The currency increased more than 1 per cent in $1,5505 and was cut down to $0,84 per cent in euro to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index was concluded with a stimulation of 1,49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the extraordinary action on the market and made a 20% spring after the transfer offer of the Rivalen AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest brauries of the world and collect marks such as Buddhist, Stella Artois, Parani and Grolsch.
Burberry's acts were more than 0.9% after a threat message from the competition concerts for Luxus Gutter Richemont.
Richemonts' newly sells all expectations and also showed that the use in China - a key market for Burberry - was reported again.
Actions of Glencore increased to 5% after the Bergbauries said that he took $2.5 billion by a purchase as part of his crime strategy.
The actions of the packing and Paper Concern Moni were the largest losses in the index, and with a back-up of 4,3% after Goldman's assessment for the company rating.
JD sports increased 3.1% after the sport clothing undertakings for half year reported a preliminary result of 46.6 million.
The leader of JD Sports says that higher solutions are risking the expansion.
The employer of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum loan for UK employees could mean "the more buying power in the boards of potential customers".
But it is impossible that this power will be compared to the higher work costs in his company, he says.
The costs could meet the JD Sports' expansion plans, added, and it could mean that there are less additional workplaces.

Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Slow 21 years old, a shopping with super-ship fress.
The type of plastic hairs is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Mr Bieber is now in Berlin.
And the U17 generation turns through.
He knows Viktoria Russ.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
Not bad.
Hundreds of Fans joined Justin yesterday.
Eva and Victoria from Poland.
However, from 7:00 tomorrow, the police sits on the cold stone place for Berliner Luxus hotel at Potsdamer place.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live in Idol, whose posters are busy in Stettin, from Montgavend.
The Suite in which the Canadian songs lives, costs as much as their mother Ewa in half year.
If you're in the case.
She says, "My Wiktoria must be sitting in the tenth class in Gymnasium."
"I fulfill you a dream."
Sculpture?
Who's kidding?
Not the fans.
Not Bieber himself.
He didn't worry about it.
For the reklame in the superbowl's reputation, he caught three million, a two-year-year-old deal with an anti-pickle-firma many, many dollars on Bieber-Account.
And at every puppe, which looks like he and over the ladentic, caught Bieber also.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you'll stand on the window board.
More than 100 million, he must be built so.
Some say the Hype has gone too far.
Others say, Bieber is finally just in the United States and British with his new single "What do you mean?" at place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album should follow in November, does not interest the many zeros first.
At least he's doing this.
Pegida Plakat brings Libanese to the idea of cartoffelder
Cartoffel or Danger?
It's both - and even in the cartoffielder who developed the Oldburger Imbissiteer Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "Cartoffel instead of Döner" on a place of Pegida movement Alhay Cartoffel and meat joined on a spice.
On the idea he brought him a place at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Carterfels instead of Döner", which he had a random seen in the TV.
Since he turns into his laptop, a glass pitched with meat and cartofels.
"This is multiculti for the magic," says Alhay.
The idea was allowed to enter the Libanese during the patient in munchen.
It has been protected after the information of the Authority since shortly as a use pattern.
As many flesh and how many cartofels of the spice contain, Alhay does not want to raise.
It's just so much: "It's crazy together yet better," he finds.
Also, in his customers, the kulinary people's understanding will be well.
Metcash starts the ground competence campaign to fight Aldi incidents
Metcash trys to protect the IGA-Filials before a Aldi-Australia and Western Australia.
Metcash has started a campaign of ground-intensity campaign to defend the market part of the IGA units in South Australia and West Australia in the field of 700 million dollars of Aldi-Invasion.
During Aldi, the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia started the next year, strengthened Metcash and IGA Supermarks their relations with local food suppliers and built the IGA mark by Mainstream Marketing and marketing on social media, as well as on events such as Adelaide-Show.
IGA manufacturers and leathers are going to the boat, with marks such as Eissteller Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes in IGA-leading tests and carriers, who sold the loaded tickets for the South Australian footballliga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash is published further details of its protection strategy on 29 September when the largest food, alcohol and equipment is carried out its annual investors strategy day.
It is much in the game because about 30 per cent of Metcash IGA loading works in South Australia and Western Australia and generating higher winning margins than Metcash IGA networks in East States.
Investors in South Australia and Western Australia are notoric provincial and IGA units available on a lot of stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in West Australia in comparison with about 14 per cent in East States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed about five per cent of the food market in these two States and all existing actors, but, mostly, self-financial individuals will be removed.
A report published in this week, according to the Analysis Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley, estimated that IGA units could lose 360 million dollars per year and Metcash 250 million dollars until the end of 2016.
This prognoses includes that Aldi opens 25 Philials in SA and 30 in WA and will be achieved by $500 million and $600 million in every market.
The loss of food and food business and the quantities on the high fast costs base of Metcash could cost about 13 million dollars of winning before costs and staff, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash's marketing in the East States, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recently implemented question of Roy Morgan found that IGA purchases are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley agrees that Metcash's use in food and food business is 3,8 per cent in 2016 for 4,1 per cent in 2017 and 2,1 per cent in 2018 and reduces the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the leader of the funds manager Hamish Douglass, the citizens of the Magellan Financial Group, in a business in Melbourne, told me that Metcash probably in a decade. Metcash will be lost.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr. Douglass.
But it will be concluded that a member of Metcash has taken contact with Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has increased from 18% to 14% since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which is at least 1,200 IGA units, has become 43% of the operational offences in the same time pressure and margins.
However, the greater officer is investing more than 150 million dollars to compare the prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve the IGA units in the improvement of their layers by rapid growing fresh food and to provide a better choice to private label life.
Metcashs Master Officer Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and loading programmes will be established to Elan and hoped that the Grand Hawker in 2017 will be returned again for the first four years in a wedding growth.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennisverband Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis has more lob than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "Collateral Disasters" in the recent sturm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and rewarded in view of the President of the Australian Tennisverband Steve Healy higher lob as a criteria for his own behavior.
Cokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always called "Special Ks", has been raised by the amazing combination of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the Rampenlight.
In a famous qualitative game in Cincinnati soon, the cocknakis and his friend Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the smooth judge, where Harrison expressed: "Wawrinka had to shoot Cyrgios, and I should shoot the child."
While he was recently seen how he shocked a tennis slider after a battle made a potential US-open seat of Richard Gasquet, Cokkinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, in concurrence with Sam Groth around the second place behind Bernard Tomic in Davis-Cup-Halbfinal against the British.
"A thing I am very exciting is the fact that Thanasi was a little inside to the battle," healy said.
He broke a slider when he lost a crazy in the United States opening, but he is not the first player who broke a slipper from his own, and I know Thanasi enough to know that he is not honourable.
But, really, he has been very good in the US opens, even among the very provocative circumstances with Harrison and so further, and I think he is a lot of recognition.
He has a great team for himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he was a little too strictly treated.
He is a very rich 19 years old, he works very hard, and he passes in the team and so further, he has never had a problem with the other players, he will be respected in the neighborhood area, he trained hard, he is good in the form, he is a very stabiler and exciting young man, and I think he's rewarded to be judged after his own services.
Healy also supported the decision that Kyrgios should not take care of the important proposal, which begins on freet, and describes the "common decision" as the right decision for all, but he will ensure the man from Canberra to return as a longer fixed part to the team."
"First we want that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controvers around [Kyrgios]," healy said.
And I believe that Nick has made the upstairs very quickly, where people like Federers and Murray have shown. He has increased in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad errors and has rewarded all the criteria he has received, but we are trying to support him to make him understanding the consequences of his trade. Some time outside the ramp light he can only think about it, I'm appreciated, and it's the best for the humanity and it's the best for him.
Europe's flight crisis: Hungary explains the situation, closes the border, keeps flights back
Hungary explained the situation and declared the south borders with Serbia on the Sunday and held all those who tried to come to the country.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered themselves into a German country and reacted Serbian officers with emphasis.
The people who fled before violence were set up for an unknown time in a country street on the street between the two control points of the country and built cells and went down there.
But Frustrations have increased.
As a policy smoking over them, the migrants scanned "Open the borders" and cried to the Ungarn equipment policy.
Show some from the protest food and water back.
The Serbian Foreign Minister explained that it was "innacceptable", that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) would be part of the solution and not a collective challenge.
In the next days, Ivica Dacic has to be discussed with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prag.
The Turbulens at the Ungarian Serbian border were not able to join a common implementation policy on a day after the 28-nation block in a step in Brussels.
However, the Ministry agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for air in the overbroken Italy and Greece, and they pressed their hope that the next month or to the end of the year would have been agreed that the EU States would take more 120,000 fleeting, including some of the Hungary.
The contracting candidates Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special field of the European Union on the Sunday to address the continent's introduction crisis.
However, Hungary had not put his hopes to a valid action of Brussel or of his neighbors.
The state called on the Sunday in two southern regions, the authorities had more powers to explore the crisis, so that they could lock the streets and explore the asyl procedures.
The Hungary Foreign Ministry Peter Sýjarto said that his country also had the building of a steel railway saun after its border to Romania to stop the migrants through the country - after the field has finished the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used at the concurrency to build the stage rates between Hungarian and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has become a significant invasion and to enter into the European Union for many military flights from Syria and otherwise in the nearest east.
However, President Victor Orban concluded that most achieved economic flights are in search of a better life, and not war flights who have the responsibility for protection - a view that is strong in contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws in the north-night in Hungary are forced by the overseers of the border or the cases of 4 meters (13 feet), which the Government has built through the southern border to Serbia, to make a crime. These laws also set up higher challenges for human offenders.
"Because the situation that has been made by the mass migration, the Hungary Government explains the state of the situation," said the Governor Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city Segoed.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border transition is a crime.
The Parliament must still apply the use of the military, which is expected for the next week, but the reporters of Associated Press have seen the limit of severe armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Landes Security Officer for Orban, said that the authorities had 45 people in trying to overcome the limits, 15 others had already been deeply entered into the country.
They are now in police warranty and will be accused of committing crimes according to the new laws.
The authorities are to reform the saun quickly.
Hungary officers closed two of the seven borders with Serbia, after a shipping car with a steel rate to close the borders.
Chaos ran around the main border transition near Ross, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of humans and pressed a lot of people to enter into it.
There were about 20, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main car connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they could go to Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clintons Press for Bernie Sanders in national questions
The former US Foreign Ministry Hillary Clinton continues to continue a two-sufficient proposal in democratic roads for the nomination on national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins you at the ground.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic choices in the proposals (58 per cent), while Sanders are in second place, with 27 per cent (amount to 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet stated whether he candid for the President, has a support of 15 per cent of the democratic electoral elections of the elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the proposals, most democratic choices say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will be supported.
But Clinton's supporters are more active in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News review, Clinton lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders got a few wines.
Clinton holds a great prevention in women and employees, but these preventions have reduced themselves.
Their support with men is clearly smoking, and Sanders are here only with five points.
Clinton's privilege in democratic choices under 50 years has flexible, and they and Sanders are now on the same height.
However, Clinton has another great advice in the elderly choices.
In the past month Clinton was two-sized presence in the Liberals, but Sanders had now a 5-point preview at this group.
The half of the democratic electors of the elections in the country says that they would support Clinton's approval if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some of the maintenance and more 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
It may not be surprised that Clinton's current supporters are maintained in particular.
The views are strengthened with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only one quarter would support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic choices of the proposals say that they support Clinton with support, the republican choices say less about their canadian Donald Trump (35 per cent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in a open question why they want to be the candidate, it is often the answer that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be presidential (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
From Clinton supporters, its connection to Bill Clinton (9%) is also mentioned.
Agreement to relationship with the problems and the electionability will also be quoted.
Since the Vice-President leads a potential for the Chairman of the President, 57 per cent of the democratic elections of the elections would like to see him in the road, although a third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic choices are asked who would be for the party their second choice, they are in the shop.
From Clinton's Attaggers say more than half that prayers would be their second choice long before Sanders.
If you decide to candye not for the nomination of the democracies, Hillary Clinton's prevention has increased from 20 points with pounds on 30 points without it.
Fifty-fifty per cent of the democratic choices will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the choice, but this number of 78 per cent in the last month.
The prayer is a second in this measurement, but the percentage that looks at him as the "selectable" is increased.
However, in the question, what is more important in a candidate, the Democratic Choices say about the electionability.
Like the last month, there is no only democratic candidate or potential candidate for these choices as an inacceptable candidate.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important characters in the elections of their party.
Most of them consider Clinton, Sanders and Pieds as honest and confident and with strong guidance qualities.
Besides, the three candidates are the best of the reality, while Clinton's strength is the guidance.
Third percent of the democratic choices do not believe that Clinton is honest and confident, so many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion about him.
The Democratic Choices of the elections also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideally in accordance with their views.
In all these measures, a fourth of the democratic choices have no opinion of sanders.
As questions on Hillary Clintons use a personal email address and a server during the office time as a foreign minister, most democratic electors of the proposals are satisfied with their statement of the question and say that it has not been affected in their views.
But it's another story in the United States.
The half of the Americans are now inadequate with their statement, while only one third is satisfied.
The public opinion was in March soon after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controls did not have effects on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse.
There are mainly republicans, more than six of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honestly and trusted by the choices of their party, it is still a problem for them under the choices: only 32 per cent they see as honest and confident, eight percent less than the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 per cent of the electoral officers do not hold for a honest and confident person.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the electoral officers are not honest and untrumped.
But Clinton and Trump have good notes in guidance.
From the six assaulted candidates, Carson and Bush shoot the best in the reality.
A majority sees Sanders more honest than honest, but as Carson, many don't think of him.
The failure cost for 351 democratic choices in the proposals is 6 per cent points.
Ben Carson turns back to landscape near Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located at the last question of CBS News/New York Times closely behind Donald Trump
On the two candidates, the half of the support of the choices in the new question, and others lost dramatically.
Republican electors continued to support Trump in a large number of countries. The support increased from 23 % in the last CBS issue which was carried out before Fox News Debatte in the past month to 27 % in the consultation of the Sunday.
But Carson shocked in the same period of 6% to 23%.
The question also concluded that Carson was well arrived in demographic groups and overrided Trump under republic choices with high school education.
The rest of the field, except by Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gubernator John Kasich, is cut down with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker, who has been deeply caught, but from 10% support in the last month at 2%.
The ancient Florida-Guverner Jeb Bush, the ancient governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio is 6% on the third place.
The bug margin in the steal test of 376 people of Republican elections in this recent question is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September.
The most recent CNN/ORC issues published last week shows that Carson has increased in the discussions - he has contributed to 19% support with the Republicaners, after the Trump with 32% support.
The last question of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a look at a Carson upstairs last week, Trump found a few pages of the old neurochirurgen, even after Carson was sorry to ask the Trumps faith in question.
"We need energy," said Trump on the past Sunday during a campaign progress in Iowa.

Five members of the brothership with the death of a Baruch College Neulings
Two years ago, after a student was dead during a shikanish ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders will be made against five people.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brothership took Chun "Michael" sound during a introduction rule in September 2013 and continued his transport into the hospital, which has contributed to his death, the police shared with.
The officers said he was loaded with an eye connected with a 30-pound pack sack full of sand, and it was again attacked while he tried to go over a field of crazy field.
Mr. Deng finally smoked about head pains, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brothership did not call the Notruf number 911 after the sound was declined and waited for a hour before they brought him into a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change the dress of Deng's clothing to go out his symptoms and Andy Meng to contact the national President of the brothership to get the Council, said the policeman Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"In this point, the members started to hide outsensiles and put the good of the brothership basically about Michael Deng," said the police car.
He couldn't be struck again, and he died next morning in his destructions.
Following a autopsie report, the sound was repeated with stealing force of disorders to head, smoking and overseer.
"To many families were destroyed by the skins of the brothership. At least one student died every year at the skins," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawman, who departed from the deep family, in a statement.
Brotherships and their members must be taken into account, and this step of the authorities is very important.
A county Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an attack for the third grade for the first five members.
Two-third members of the brothership, including Mr. Mung, are also attached to a criminal agreement.
"We don't only want to make responsibility to the participants, but if there is a organization who has sanctified this - officially or unofficial - we will also take this to account," said Wagner on a press conference on the Sunday.
The Baruch College has prohibited the brothership, and the national brothership has called its relativeity to the local group.
This will happen when the feed increases the tensions
A cyntical higher is come, and the household will be rent into the shops, the resources for the shipment will be increased, and the economic will be attached to a reserve.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it ends and how long it will stop.
Especially, the history of the economy provides only small leadership.
A receition was only 11 months after the first increase of investment and was 86 months.
The aggressivity of the federal reserve of the investment is often, even though it is not always, a factor, as the economy and financial facilities.
Therefore, the representatives of the United States Central Bank have so severely stated that investors should not concentrate when they begin to increase the costs, but much more in the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, the market participants may be determined that the whole review was possible for a cine increase.
"The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "profit money", said Julian Jessop, chef economy at Capital Economic, in a communication to customers.
In addition, we don't expect the global return of the US cities to normal heights, but still to a lower level to lead to the sexy chock that seems to be afraid of many.
However, it doesn't mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy may react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the prevention of Zinser increases can make things for a long time.
While increases, the influence is not so dramatic.
"It seems to be a tendency that the concurrent contracts will be cut off 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may be repeated to the retard in the money policy," said German-bank analysis in a new study to what happens after the Fed's concentration.
On the other hand, the market has been in the past 35 years most of the override - about 14 per cent - on the way to the cycle higher, increasingly flash in the 250 days after (a average winning of 2,6 per cent), then back to normal access to 500 days, with a average remedie in the past six past cycles of 14,4 per cent according to a current analysis, Bob Doll, Chef shipping straight by Nuveen Asset Management, with Barron's publication.
The German Bank said that the impacts on the acts are later in the increase cycle and the rests begin to reduce.
Recesions are a fact of economic life, but cine increases often promote them.
In the present case, the feed is compared with some conditions that it has not been given before and that it could be rejected.
In addition, it is noted that the product of Bruttoinland will be near its lowest points at the increase of the feed.
According to the German bank, 118 Zins increased from 1950 only twice the nominal BIP under 4,5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3,6 per cent, only waited for the third quarter after the data of Atlanta Fed only 1,5 per cent.
The German Bank said, "Is it different?"
Market participants have made themselves all the year on a cyne upgrade of the Fed, and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week, which ends on Sunday.
While many strategy and economy believe that the FOMC could apply a increase in this meeting, the Future Management is only a probable 25%.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today have been found in a Super cycle with an excessive smoking at the BIP and the pre-resolution heights have been made very quickly after the beginning of the maintenance in the shadows," says the report.
In the same way, this is an uncertainly lately sustainable of what was the worst reception in the observed phase.
The current cycle is the length of the Fed since the end of the last reception; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months ago.
The fixed income was also volatil, since the market moves a cyntical increase, and the pattern is very similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effects in training are faster than in acts when the change of their strategic course.
The resources seem to change the direction when the first increase/senkation is followed in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the leaderships fell immediately, the German Bank said.
The strategys of Charles Swab believe that the growth of the inches will lead to the remedies between the longer and the shorter lengths closer and lead to a displacement of the curve.
Highversitivities often bring in a climate better results, although "we are still careful to expect higher results," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analysis in Swab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones says that the markets have already applied to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollars and the return of inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has applied to the view of the stricter money policy," she wrote.
The short-term rates are increased, the currency curve is flake, the credit skins have expanded themselves, and the volatility is increased - all the characters of the market, when the feed has increased their strategy.
In large and entire enterprises, which develop the largest part of their business in the United States, will benefit from when investments increase and explore local products.
Multinational companies with high crimes will be worse because a higher dollar makes their products more on the global market and also financing their crimes.
"The story shows that "Qualitys-" acts to react more positively after a starting cycle increase," said Goldman Sachs Analyst in a report for the customers.
Companies with stronger bilance have overrid undertakings with weak balance after each of the cyne increases 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital borders and lower volatility in their acts have also override their pendants with lower quality for average 4 (procent points) and 3 (procent points).
The crimes will be a big problem.
Companies with a high deal of flexible interests are lost at most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure acting games, consumers also benefit by the increased dollar.
Spearer may see wines by higher products, even if experts are different opinions how quick it will be found.

Parliament's college Damien Collins took the sending The Voice and said that it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "Rounds" to Classic FM, means a leader member and increases new pressure on the sender, to prove that he does something that the private sentence does not do.
The Conservative Secretary-General Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC Boss that the public-recht radio sender "overdumme" and not more than its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems to - I don't like the word "verdummen" - but it seems to be converted to Classic FM," he said.
He also held the BBC Music Awards who started in the last December.
The BBC Music Awards, who started last year, appeared to be the Britishs only under another name.
So, if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, with which you actually just imitate what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC General Director, as well as the proposals, argumented that the BBC radio 3 is long before its commercial competitors, if it goes to Live music and the public statement.
What I learn from radio 3, I will never learn about classic music anywhere different.
And there is an enhancement for Live music and musicians that is really unoverrided.
"And the enhancement of radio 3 to find new music and to give new works in the task, I really keep for important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey has to be employed soon that the public should be involved as far as it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classic music.
However, radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production, which, during the audience of the Committee for the selection of culture, media and sports, was the only element of the BBC production, to put the market rivals on the feet.
The Tory-Administrated Damien Collins took the Voice to - the musical Talent-Show of the BBC, which was buyed by the Netherlands producers Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall concluded that the BBC 1-Show - was produced with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "in special BBC-weis".
He added that he wanted to find the company "a hit from our household" when it started a conversation series next time.
However, he refused to exclude further numbers of the Voice in the future or to pay the money of the payments for other discussions formats.
Internet facilities increase in August at least and the Black Friday may be responsible for that
In the first three months of the year 2015, there were seven percent of steel in the online sell.
In the last month, the lower results have been since the beginning of the records in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using the phones to buy
Experts believe that Black Friday in November has reached the expenditure
For more than a decade, the virtual purchases have been built, and many of the main investment streets have changed themselves into spiritual cities.
However, experts say that now there are marks that the online ranges are stealing after new numbers have shown only seven percent in the first three months 2015.
The total costs for August presented the smallest growth from the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent of increase against the previous year.
Experts say that there are marks that online sales stagnize after showing new numbers only seven percent of growth in the first three months 2015
"When you look at the growth rates for the previous year and return to 2000, then it has always been developed during the time," said Andy Mulcahy, the manufacturer of the IMRG sales index of the Guardian.
He explained that the online sells increased three years ago as the buyers started to work with their phone income.
It was meaning that more people could buy online and that people could do this in various environments, for example to house on the sofa.
But now it is depending on, and we may live that growth reduces.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America will be a reason for the following positions.
Experts believe that the customers keep their income before this event, even at the last Friday in November.
In the past year, five times the average number of buyers to make their computers, and some handheld websites were struck.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which the purchasers fighted by shoes, could stop buyers of it to buy income.
One study of the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 £ expenditure was issued more than 1 £ online.
In some products such as televisions and wax machines, more than one third of the income is now carried out on web shops.
At the same time, more than a fourth of people's clothing and shoes online in the modems in the cities.

Others have the half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of the east-European workers is over
British Employment Handwerker, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified manufacturers in Eastern Europe has increased behind themselves
This causes that 200 additional screwfix loads are opened on handhelds
In the same time Kingfisher 60 B&Q sells outside country
From Rupert Steiner, City Chef-Korresponder of the Daily Mail
It is meaning that the British will reduce their rooms and pinsels from the use of qualified South European trade workers who carry out the works in their home.
If you can send with a hammer or a pinsel to the surrounding of walls, you are apparent to a minority today.
Because the British workers are employed to carry up homeworker jobs in their homes, so the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new employer of Kingfisher, who possesses the tree market cat, said that a large increase of the number of qualified manufacturers from Eastern Europe, the services for depth prices have been provided.
So Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which are directed to handhelds and close 60 sales of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to work more women in B & Q-Shops, since eight of ten of the 10 purchase decisions in the load are found by women.
At the moment, the men are overcoming with the workers.
She said that it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that demonstrate more fairly single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men in our Philials.
We have to move this stronger to a equal growth.
The half of our clients from women with 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a great role in the decision process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women in the place of a British index in the FTSE100 index, has also constructed its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in guidance positions.
Kingfisher is nearly the only company that has attached exactly 50% of the team with women, including his business and financial property.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was the most conscious decision - Multifalt is a important subject here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory Council.
Kingfisher reported a return at the half-year wine wine and the costs after the group decreased the costs for the closing of the sounds.
According to the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B&Q will open 200 new films.
Functions of Aich/Dob because of infidelity before the Court
At the Court of Landeseshood, two functioners of the Australian Volleyball Vize-Leader Aich/Dob have to be responsible for infidelity and expenditure.
The accused don't know.
One of them was also attached to the use of officers.
This proposal has been directly published in May.
The current process has been hidden.
According to the Officer Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation crisised that the accommodations in 2006 to 2011 were used for private purposes of the United States accounts on which they should be available in their functions.
The smoke is fixed by about 400,000 euros.
The sport functioners are also attached to financial procedures.
This fact shot the President of the Chairman, Director Michaela Sanin.
It should be treated at a later time.
To the unbelievers, the defence has made that the Treaty has not been given a part of a reliable report.
The sport functioners had only comprehensive disagreements and the sport club for which they had been carried out from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had been invested many times and money, the passivs were attached to 600,000 shilling in 2001.
"Damals, we stand before the situation: we continue or close the club?", said one of the accommodations, in the employment of the big employee of the Financemt.
With his colleagues and associates, he decided to take this task.
With all risks.
"We have proposed money to put our live risks as security to the bank," he said to the income.
The Agreement has been agreed: You can handle the money free, it cannot be done only.
Furthermore, in accordance with financial - success has been decided that the expenditure of the rehabilitation is reefficient until 1991.
It is therefore paid a part of the expenditure disagreements first years later, since 2003, as a plus on the account was paid.
Therefore, it appeared to be a breakfast and not detailed books, the former man explained the events.
The accounts and spiders managed the two accommodations together, said the second chapter.
Why the payments were not published to the Treaty, the judge asked.
The Agreement has not interested in the detail for the financial agreement, it is important that it was only the freedom of crime, so that the answer.
As in 2011, a total of 120,000 euros was remitted to the agreement on a functional remediation in the office of the consumption in 2011.
That was a relief, the officers explained.
This value paper account was on the name of the second accommodation and was not recognized according to the Treaty.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
Then the questioner knew no answer.
Then, finally, he believed that this was the best for the Treaty.
If something happens to him, nobody knew anything about this money, the State lawyer put it in the room.
The officer had been informed, the functionality was justified.
This subscription was formed as a "shaden exhaustion".
Why was the challenge?, they wanted to know the judge and the lawyer.
Following the first range, he was not understood with this formulation because the Treaty had never been a shame.
But what shall I do if the lawyer says, "You are all of the sniper."
"I am a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functioner said he never saw a hundred detentions, he had just a kilometer money and dead.
In Germany, he added to the Treaty 1,000 euros per month, however, the real exploitation was much higher, added to the Treaty.
The new documents for the past years could not be submitted to the accommodations.
These were not reserved after a operating test, where everything was judged as correct, they declared.
It was also the second range of kilometers.
All reliefs have been successful in the bar that he had to go from his resident market to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his opinion.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the question of witnesses.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play monthly for double fracture
Luke Shaw allows a double fracture of his right feet in the Champions-League Download of Manchester at the PSV Endhoven.
While this is the left foreign protector to win and will be excluded for at least six months from the games, Louis van Gaal does not expect that Shaw can play again in this saison.
The destruction was caused by an invisible attack of Hector Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was interrupted in the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the game field and needed steel substance before he was carried into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double infracture and lives in the hospital."
He's going to leave tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it's happening.
He had a smooth mask in the clothing cabine.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then the six months will end, and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this saison again.
Moreno seemed happy to be a red card and the dependence of an elf meters.
Nicola Rizzoli, the Short Director, did not confirm the Mexican.
Van Gaal convinced that the Italian smoking judge was wrong.
You can assess yourself if I tell you that an elf meter and a red card was fallen.
It was a very bad attack with both feet.
A second on Shaws account said, "I thank you all for your messages. The words can't describe how I'm able to be, my way to genius now, I'll come back stronger."
Follow: Some United leads the loss of Luke Shaw at the deadline at PSV
The Protector of England has additional advanced with the European Government in France to get to the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad loss."
If a player with this kind of destruction leaves the place, all are very threatened about it.
It's never the view of our player to lose a jealousy.
Moreno rejects a break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland manship at the WM 2014.
"He's very hard because it wasn't his mind to lose the worst, and when you hear that it's a very bad loss, it's not good," said Cocu.
I couldn't see the moment for me.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction so that it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 said Moreno, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel bad about that, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a fool game of Chris Smalling.
Are you sure you know David Cameron the Lorax better?
It is a thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not be long until you almost know it outside.
No, you might be David Cameron.
When he was requested by a provider of children's integrity systems to call his favorite book, the President of the Lorax, the environmental area of Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a hard choice, Cameron writes a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Sleep, moved, creative, and with a strong message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it seems always to give an image or a message we have passed before."
All good and good, except that the following paragraph, in Cameron, will describe the action of the book, instead of a content of the film version of 2012, will be added to new characters and details to expand the very short original text.
"In the midnight of the town Tneed-Ville, where all nature has gone, and even the air is a good thing, a young Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, while he wants to see a real tree, full of it," reads. A loving interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name Theodor Seuss Geisel was launched and died in 1991, but was totally unknown.
As it would not be enough: the text presented by Cameron is partly readed as the matching of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and then begins: "In the citizen city Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a product, hopes to win a young ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl's dreams."
Although he is able to be a pragmatic father, it seems impossible that Cameron's action of the book is so little confident. Here is a unnamed boy, as the local environment falls through the woods, toneed smoking once-lears, instead of the protest of the named Lorax, a hot, smoking, smoking ways, "what says in the name of the tree," is destroyed.
The Lorax has not read 20 times behind a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's choice office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's cooperators was delivered, but there was no more direct comments.
Adam Lyth was aware of the exclusion of England's marriage, but it's still hard.
At Pakistan to steal in the United Arab Emirates, it is a hard task, but if you have chosen the box of England for the tour, there is no repeating of the 3-0 Test Series falling on my card.
I wouldn't have been out of the outside.
The Alastair Cooks page may be less than the three years ago, but there are good spin player in the Batting design, and the Community's age is strong; they will not take narrows from 2012, but only a young-positive setting.
With the ball Moeen Ali was developed as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he shows an unknown size on the test level, it is a option for the attack.
Message then: Adam Lyth separates from the English test header and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, to me as his Cheftrainer in Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are equipped on results.
There was no question marks in Joe Root, for example, and it led to the name, there - and I said this before - the players are their own best choicers.
For a long time, you had longed Lyth's run, but he had the control of his own ships.
If he hopes forward more shoes for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The British Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his behaviour, even if he didn't get so good guidances, and that doesn't surprise me; he is especially a teamman.
The question, how long a test-spitator has received to set his signs, is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance for home and foreign games.
The only suggestion that you can exalte was that England was the first Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth in the highest form - but this loss chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in here, and he's a shootman I'm high.
He's a X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this saison, when he got 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which was very coming to us.
He must at least get the same chances as the first ones before him, but, naturally, this is from the humanitarian emirates in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to shoot Moeen near Cook, which brings a extra-spin bowler and gets four quicks up, and I have nothing to do.
I don't see why a shooter can't shooter there, and this left shooter has already shown that he's a dealer of cricket player.
Moeen may not have made his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no great difference.
My previous team college Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as Opener 2001.
He made 300 runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the box as Back-up Spinner, and in my limited course with him he impressed me as a young man.
People may see its statistics - averagely 31 with the slider and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no great number of backup-speakers who lift their hands up and the trainers have decided for young.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
With regard to the marriage, England has made a few smart fulfillments in the trainer table.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, as a counseler for the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the most recent guys of the game who will bring a full of experiences because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white cool phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or a coach, and as Mahela has taken into consideration of which we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring free wind in the clothing cabine, even if the messages are in accordance with the previous story.
Collys Team College in Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be applied to the One Days, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not apply, but Coaches and Team equipers do not apply the time plan.
And you need to think that as the players depend on their jobs from the results.
Such decisions will not be made easy.
The Brexit loader (Brexit = exhaust Britannian from the EU) could win when the economy is able to be able to be able to be able to win.
David Camerons unordered new negotiation strategy to maintain the United Kingdom in the EU will be deeply in difficulties every day, even without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it or not?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC that has been threatened in Europe on the Sunday.
Foreign countries also have their corbyns and nigel farages.
A European diplomatic friend stated newly that some Member States, so deeply disappeared in various crisis, as the EU has now been, and not always created by their own sin, the United Kingdom himself created Agenda with collected circumstances and murdered contract changes that most of them do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided in their yearly meeting that it does not like it even if they are in danger of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Premier Minister and Financial Ministry will take a photo from themselves before a famous local thinking, with or without local sizes, come home and tell them that they win relations for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the Great Britain in the EU target - "Now don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and let me see that more and more short-visible ministers and employees have arrived in some capital cities until the point where we're not going.
Germany's careful cancers Angela Merkel is an association, but she is 10 years to the power and wants to leave the official before it appears to be bad for them, as it happened to the override long-term treatment such as thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and cool (16).
France's François Holland looks at his re-selection or its replacement in 2017.
He's also a lot of power.
Poland may suddenly have a nationalistic right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be thrown up a feet to help the selfie brits which should be used better for the energy to prevent the outcome of Scotland from the U.S. - something they don't want because most of the same separat tendencies have.
It is therefore possible that some of these minis are planning to even even not helpful comments, all in the SNP style, while the British Referendum campaign 2017 to explore the Brexit process, my friend.
"The new negotiation was a pleite" and "Groot Britain has won nothing of value from the renew treatment."
The Europeans know how rare the Fleet Street can be on their costs, and what EU sceptics are the oligarchie of the pressebarone, as they were not under the inspired reference of Tony Benn 1975, which was not supported by our entry 1973 with a relationship of 2:1.
You can be hard to remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro-opportunists who have made a name as a "EU-Gered Banks" Brüssel Corresponder in the past 90s.
By all his foolishness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
It is also the Medley of steer-bearing skins, telephone-hacking outlands, and the Pseudo Non-Inlands who have most of our great magazines.
In fact, Tony Blair thought like them, but stated that if you sit with a name Gorilla in a coffee, you better distribute bananas to deal with him instead of being at the middle and evening.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairer than Blair himself when he turned to Cameron's referendum virus because Blair had put the principle on the non-determined EU's opinion, which was then rejected by French and Netherlands choices in 2005 that opened him a frontur.
The price has never left him that.
But the net Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a peaceful clip on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need time to forget me - looks in danger, Neil Kinnocks Boyott Murdoch Strategy in the 80s, a mistake once and today.
It can continue, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but sure with Andrew Marr, who has left the BBC sofa on Sunday.
Corbyns is official position in Europe - I just press it welcome - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most people besides Ukip's traditional blue-carbon tendency and the wilderness of Torys Klein-English may even say yes.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn in the radio and in the TV said this week when the path founder was fighting in him, not to admit that Corbyn's name was a bad idea of the provoking John McDonnell as a smoking cancer.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father tried to be in the TV, ital to be his workshop colleagues, without to go away and lose his cabinet job.
Hilarys fight was still attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benns expression - not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his assistants and delegates after all reports on their cluster celebration on Monday.
Whatever the famous Bottom-Up image of Corbyn - think that he even had been cutting me - news-disciplin remains in the time period of TV around the hour and before all things in the structure of the social media, a brochure place of Paranoia and Rat.
It is right to give Cameron no frequency for Europe that allows him to maintain the support of Labour in the reference campaign for self-consciousness as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns are the basic majority of the EU membership - in accordance with their Bennett Refugees, their anti-capitalist history - is not only a question of the ecustic discussion under the left dissidents, for which the narcist of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic battle.
As with his majorities of Nato - Tom Watson, it is highly convinced that JC does not start campaign to exit - it will be obligated to the outland diplomats to try to find a sense for their proposals in the house.
Why should Paris or Berlin disappear the political capital, - they also have mysterious choices - to make circumstances to the British if all this can be unfair?
The United States have already been very disappointed by the weak military losses in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost of the Tory Government's power, which I have been reminded of something that was called the British Influence Security Forum at the beginning of the Monday.
Experts criticize report of Public Health England on E-Zigaretts
Considerations of a State financed Agency that the E-Zigaretts are less worse than the ransoms from a meeting of 12 persons, partly with the connections to the tabak industry, said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) closed Lancet by criticize the reports used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-Zigaretts.
PHE published the "great report" in the past month and described it as a "increasing test of evidence".
However, some investigators have carried out and showed connections between some experts and the tabak industry.
An article in the Medical Research Lancet on the last month took the "externally beneficial basis" based on the PHE its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the contents "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be rejected in the meaning of effectiveness."
They said that the public was expected that PHE's maintenance that "the current best assessment is that the E-Zigaretts are almost 95% less worse than smokes" to a detailed examination of the review and modelling.
In fact, this issue comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multiple criteria-resolution analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to bring their opinions on the difficulties of various nikotin products to a synthesis; the results of the occurrence were collected in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose business leaders had to receive the British American Tobacco Center (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report.
One of the 12 participants on the meeting declared to receive means of an E-Zigaretten Hestler, but not the financing that he should have received after reports by the board company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the election of members of the Gremium are not delivered, but there are several known E-Zigarett Championships, which some also provide a branch-financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their knowledge-how in the tabak control.
At the meeting, the Tabak Leadership of PHE also participated.
The research work of the group is "namedly" that there is a manner of "hard evidence for the worries of most products in most criteria" writes McKee and Capewell.
However, these connections or restrictions are not discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's consciences, that "not have any evidence that the E-Zigaretts served as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers."
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Health in PHE, said that BMJ has already been reacted before.
He said, "E-Zigaretts are increasingly less worse than smoking."
Every second lifeless Ruucher dies in his search.
All evidence are close to that health risks of E-Zigarett are less in comparison with this, but we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the unique obligation to information on the public about what the reveal and what is not, especially if there is a large public commitment on relative dangers in comparison with the tabak.
At least 80,000 people are dead in a disease with relationship to the smoking, and rauchs cost the national health system two billion £ per year.
With the clear suggestions of the present evidence that the E-Zigaretts are not without risk, but only one part of the shame that is caused by the smoking, we will fulfil our national competence.
BBC should specify EastEnders, says an earlier chef of Channel 4
The former President of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop send programmes like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give your right arm" for Hit-Shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the running worker should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK senters.
He criticized the BBC to place public legal programmes, which may be viewed by a small public, in several time-lines against the most favorite shows of their rivals and senters as BBC4.
After the General Director of the BBC, Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he has tried to contact the BBC for six years for his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC programmes have been taken or sent to be clearly shown by non-subventioned rivals," said Johnson to the Committee of Communications in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the running workers, which I don't keep medium or long-term for a good idea, your production should be at least on programs that do not do others or give in a job.
You send the Voice into a classic time window because they want to get a most wide support for their future.
The idea that else nobody would show this, it's a witch, it's crazy, of course it's unbelievable.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme finances that can also be financed without subventions.
The Voice is a program that EastEnders is another, given both own products.
Really, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how to be this public legal TV.
I don't think that this would reduce the BBC.
Johnson, a serial companier, leader of the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was committed to the jagd after evaluations "for the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments to the most favorable posts of the BBC reiterate what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart proposal in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the most published NIC programs should go to BBC4 where they are not able to measure the public, but they are fulfilled their tasks, and they can argument if they go on their appearing missions to justify 4 billion billion billion billion rounds, "Now, of course, we have created all these obvious programmes that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window in which nobody wanted to see them.
To the running officer Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to find an older regressive system in relation to conditions who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you have a great value for 150 £ per year here, but for people who are for 150 £ a lot of money, ask me if it's true, because they don't use much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-head David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Sunday, asked that the BBC should check their reithian mission "inform, sharing, and maintaining."
He said that only few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and it should take a example to the public legal televisions in Australia and Canada.
At the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, from which he said to be shown only a manufacturer in the television, and to enter the commercial senders Allians to make all available online.
'Sogenetics' can control the brain cells by shadows
The video shows how the Nematods change the direction in the moment where they will be carried out with sound impulses.
Scientific scientists have watched whirls with genetically changed nerve systems that can be able to struggle from shields.
The wind Nematodes change the direction in the moment where they are protected with sound motions that have a high frequency for human hearing to hear.
The impulse works through the activation of Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to bring the Membran channels that react on the Ultrashall wells.
Continue to this subject: Read and write brain activities with light
The researchers said that the whirlwinds showed the power of a new procedure, named Songenetics, can be used in the Ultrashall to enable a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher in Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that a day procedure could replace the deep-hyrn stimulation, an invasive procedure that rejects electricity into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
Fadenwaters react normally not on the Ultrashall, but Chalasani stated that they did it when they were involving a floor with microscopic air balls.
The balls, he found out, strengthen the Ultrashalls that then end in the wheels.
The strengthened Ultrashall villages affect structures that are called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membrums of some of the fuel cells.
The challenges affect the opening of these channels and enable the cells which they are assigned to, a report of Nature Communications.
To create Ultrashall steadfaced Nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the whirlwinds so that some of their mobile TRP-4-ion channels bring.
If he applies the Ultrashall on the changed creatures, the shoes will be strengthened by the microblogs and transported into the corners where they enable the changed motonions.
The procedure has several similarities with Optogenetics, a bath breaking tool that allows scientists to enable neurons with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that Songenetics could have some of these technology.
In accordance with the light, which must be sent to an optical phase to the desired position in the brain, low frequency-all-all-shirt weights can pass unlimited and so can be sent into the brain of up to the skin.
"We believe that with Gentherapie and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the human neurons immediately at least for the Ultrashall signal in a clinical set for certain neurological treatment," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells, he added.

The indicators are occupied by the British weapons trade
Look at Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Meeting Video.
Fucking murder drones!
Football smoking feeds!
In the stream!
And the electroscock stone that cause calamity, but no smoke left!
The joyful voice and the Cartoon images do not doubt that this indication for the world's largest weapons is a fighter parodie produced by Amnesty International to bring the preparation of the British Government into the Rampenlight to the repressive regime on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.
Combined: DSEI Weapons: Authorised Regimes streams to London
But a separate campaign also leads to a lot of plaquets that are in busholds and in the U-baan trains and requires a second view.
"The important announcement: Do you go from 15 to 18 September with the DLL?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the fonts of London Underground and the marks of the DLLR line, which walks to the image of a panzer.
In September, a swarm of weapons with the DLLR will go... customers will be requested to help on the stop of the weapons.
The 300 places are of artists who have made their work in the museum for grausem designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective name of the Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £-pack of inbus keys, which means that "a third part of the bus stores on the planet".
Transport for London doesn't find this Plakatier "Vandalism".
One of the parodies displays produced by special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Kurator of Crueol Designs and Dozens at the University of Essex, the artists will be critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galeries.
Many artists are active in the work of protest moves and notice that they have to be in the real world to have an influence on the society.
One more of the anti-warming planets welcomes the Pendler in the U.S.
The Amnesty Video has been considered more than 100,000 times in 24 hours over Facebook and has been made by the VCCP Conversion Agency, which works together with the grapher and Voiceover artists, who also works without cost.
The VCCP-Creative Director Matt Lever was surprised about the silences around the publication of the weapons - through a party of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "We give them the campaign that they are trying to deny."
They played with the finding of a realistic duplicate company, but "with the integration with brilliant colours and animation, it remains stronger."
"They have made a wonderful job by helping us to buy awareness about the sale of illegal volunteer equipment on the Messe," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a British government's entry and the guarantee that the volunteer devices will not be handled illegally before our household.
Maybe the most creative art around the weapons are out of the area within ExCeL, where the manufacturer is amazingly euphemistic products.
In a pre-section, Saab shows an admission of the US army on "the AT4CS RS RS cut down by the shooter."
It is also a "the only formed board of warfare, which provides exciting impacts within the target."
Whatever it does, it will not be a pleasure.
Eight gold rules for life in students
11 years ago, I went to a student's house, still in faith in Berets and Moral Relativism, but now I remember the inspired songs of those I have hurt - and the numerous, long-term discourages about others.
Most of what I learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
The income in students' homes is enough from easy nervous explosion until to absolutely scared.
It's locked to snow: people tell you where you come, and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you're saying, "Don't love Marmite or hate, because in serious case, boys, it's just a hefeextract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Attach.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It takes the conversation and helps you to find people who would like to speak with those who wouldn't talk, even if your winds were broken in the burn and they would be the firewrecks.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often changed in driving receptions, film-night assemblies and communities, but they are also the positions of which people get and justify their underwaters.
Follow: Don't think of starting the Union with a relationship
Introverted gets a big treatment in the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many students have a room-bumbling culture, which is peaceful and social, and can lead long friendship to life.
This can be the hell for someone who trys to get up.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away to reach the energy that I have used for interaction with you."
Try to hear when a commilion is created of community - and send an SMS to him instead of closing him.
Accept: Do it.
A boy in my students had the suggestion that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes back.
Since you start the Union at the height of the Back Many, it is the lock on the doors of people to imagine with a entire brownie, less amazing than the welcome of the 1950s, "Well in the neighborhood, I have cut you something. So, and now, please, if I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer householded leckers is a good way to close friendships.
Their neighbors feel obligated to discuss themselves and, at the end, your face may be associated with a lonely surprise.
Of course, it's the way you're a comprehensive bucker.
The bad lost cuts of meal, sugar and feet leads people to sleep when you touch.
It is a fair crime in students' homes.
Of course, the clue of hair is a debt stone, but is it the takement of a trop of milk for your tea?
Check this with the milk ringer.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's worse, and you have my feeling - but try to turn out more than my neighborhood who adds a smoke to smoke the debt.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't do a dream that people are from sleep or from work.
It is not only to be an intelligent man, but that you are in the most serious sense of the prophecy to the people sitting in the Glass House.
A girl on my river asked their neighbors if it could help them to put something more slower to Drum & Bass because it was three hours tomorrow, and she had a test on the morning.
They reacted to it with a louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5:00, she left her neighbors to sleep peacefully more than two hours before she left her own music, she closed her door and came to her thirty-time test.
Wouldn't it romantic if your future marriage would be able to enter the same student home?
Wouldn't it be absolutely painful if you keep a neighborhood for your future marriage, take care of her to turn back and then she needs to see each day and perhaps live as they are all joint friends to themselves?
Of course, the heart goes to his own way - but if a hot neighborhood definitively is not your future marriage, try at least to interpret your underlife a little funeral.
In the moment that you notice that someone has left his key in his unlocked room, the limit between an oil and the mobing is worse than it seems.
A good street is funny, but it's waiting for a moment until he's going to bumerang.
Give a valid and valuable reading about security - but never cut any room with Zahnpasta and Shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass water, which you then put in the worm - but tackle your possessions on the deck no more than twice.
Room houses for flights, single driving, small values
The immobilist Markus Gildner is built in the Mediterranean Eckental Room houses for people who have no lot of money.
So, for flights - but also as a signal: "Not only flights need apartment, but also the only mother and the smaller values."
"I show how you can still build good and good today," says the 44-year-old in the Interview
Thousands of flights will be covered on the apartment market.
The employer Markus Gildner believes how quickly it can be created: He is built in a project room house for flights.
Mr. Gildner, many flights will be thrown on the apartment market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive subtraction in containers or tourn halls has no sustainability.
Because people stay here in a big part.
In view of the flight stream, we also need enough room in the next decades.
A total banal, three-sheet row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least place.
It improves integration.
It's different if you're cutting people in rooms.
Each of the six houses that are just built in the pilot project have three apartments for four asylum competitors.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a restroom.
It may be that many flyers will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted after the same needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters apartment per house is at 184 000 euros, without base.
It's overviewable.
Six months have been waiting for the building.
That's approval.
Have the building rules complied with their plans?
Gildner: I've actually passed my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the wormful Damokles Square and the provisional Regulation.
Great.
It is still understood that one who makes three rooms in a room is required at least three rooms.
Only in the cities there is no place.
And flights and asyl competitors have no cars.
How did the inhabitants respond to their chair house project?
Gildner: There are some who have proposed me to create luxury buildings for asylum competitors.
That's definitely not true.
But do you not smooth the competitive fight for payable rooms?
Gildner: True is: We had a build tree in Germany in the last five years, but Luxembourgs were built, which couldn't be more than one.
My project has the message, also the normal people need a place.
Not only flights, but also the only mother or the lower values.
I show how you can build good and good today.
That's why.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, write to "General" and then select "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some are stopped after the installation of problems because they received a bug message that reports that the "Software Update failed".
In order to interact the problem, users will be recommended to wait or wait until the insurance returns or trys to update over iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may be possible to delete applications to create space - but Apple has made it more impossible through the discharge of the update. It will also be easier to do if you use a special tool to remove apps and then reinstall it when the process is completed.
It is pleased to ensure that your mobile phone is uploaded during the update or is located near a loader, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may be disabled at halfway and can lead it to an interruption of the update.
Continue reading: iOS 9 Release still at the time, instead of the WatchOS breakdown in the check of iOS 9: it is at least amazing, but the best update of iOS 9: How you prepare for the new iPhone operating system

Rosberg's only devise: Full Attacke
Nicko Rosberg knows in fight against the WM title in the form 1 against his clear Mercedes team college Lewis Hamilton is only a devise: "Volle Attacke".
The WM's range mentioned before the start in the seven oversee rans, "and I have nothing more to lose."
53 points are separated by the Vize World Master in Singapore at this Sunday of Title Protector and Duplex Champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the former 12 saison lines and takes the airlight-grad price in the city, even as favorite in attack.
2009 and in the past year, the 30 years old British could win the road.
If the current smog in the city State will be affected on the great price of Singapore, it is still unclean.
Since days, a dark lock is over the city, excluded by branches on the neighbor Sumatra Island.
Bad Kissinger Schach club has a prominant member
The chair club based "Schachfreunde Bad Kissing" has taken another member in his line, so the number of members increased at 19 players.
The new member is the employer Paul Gauselmann, a passionated shoes and tennis player who received more than 40 times in Bad Kissing.
Gauselmann is the leader of the cross of the Agreement and the town of the City Espel Camp and Lübbecke.
The challenge club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a speed, the President Alfred Klein.
This is possible to take a challenge player that can't take the Member State's contribution.
Youth work and tax research should also be pre-operated.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the shock club and also a peaceful contact with the tennis club "Rot white" is considered as a expression of his connection with the curtain.
Quartiers Office searchs direct contacts
Saudis and the old Antoniost Centre have collected themselves under the maintenance of the social certification and opened a new place in the graph-stauffenberg platz.
Besides consultations, you can also share in curses.
The social exploitation goes down from the mountain to the inner town.
He later said to the Graph Staffenberg Platz.
A new Quartiers office was opened recently.
Here, immediately close to the market of income, you will receive officers and consulting information about questions such as public security or the delivery of hospitals and ships.
Since years, we convince our ambulant public service that a couple often will be allowed to be only.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Only, many of the cases will not be taken into account because the complexity of the ensure is not yet understood," explained the new householder Jutta Weigand, which is also responsible for anthonyist and citizen hospital and for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
Besides consultations, the new Quartiers Office also provides prevention, health care and wellness.
This was taken by the health in the boat.
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as the prevention, the nerve, or a physiotherapeutical treatment.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Health are in ideal ways.
Health is for prevention, prevention and reha.
"The Senior Centre for Treatment and Pflege", he wrote Heike Riedel, Agency Leader of Heudis.
The reason for the opening of the new Quartiers office in the inner town see both business leaders, especially in demographic wallet.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual cities of Bamberg in the future.
Furthermore, so understream citizens' manager Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) with the income services, the Quartiers Office also refers to the convention in the age: "There are many events and offers on the program and these are loaded to a regular healthy income."
This makes a great contribution to the society that the seniors can live in their confidential environment.
The Quartiers office is opened on Monday, Mediterranean and Friday from 9 to 14 hours, Sunday and Sunday from 16 to 18 hours and day from 10 to 12 hours.
Income Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is officially: After saneing works in Fuchspark City of the date for the FC game, Bamberg was not yet established against the third-limitist Würzburger Kickers, the 6th October was now defined as a date.
The FC Intround Bamberg in the Bamberg Final of the Bayeric Fußball Totopokals against the third-limitist FC Würzburger Kickers has now been completed.

"We are happy that we now know when the game goes on the ball, now we have planning security," so the FCE team manager Karlleinz Hemmers, which also shows the currently started cart-production.
It's something special for our marriage to play against a third.
So we hope for many supervisors, and this is not without reason, because airlight games have a special reiz.
The FC entered Bamberg 2010 in the road of the last 16 marriages and entered home against regional liabilities 1. FC Suinfurt 05 (3:2).
The concurrency manager receives 5000 euros and is qualified for the first round of the DFB Agreement score 2016/2017.
The Title Protector is a third-leading SpVgg subhaching.
Wiener Architekt Karl Mang 92-year-old death
Karl Mang, one of the Vienna Architectures, is dead.
He already died on 5 September in the age of 92 years, as the artist's house reported on the Sunday.
With Mang, the artist's house is a honourable member and like "the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna" as it was called in the sentence.
1922 was born in Vienna, studied Mung during and after the second World War Architecture at the Technical High School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he worked as a free architecture, but he was also working as teacher, writer and Institute Leader.
From 1972 to 1983, he was President of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 80-year-old, he was invited with the establishment of the room in the Vienna Hofburg and the construction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.

Dr. Frank Müller takes the Praxis of Steel Houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Steel Houses.
In this way, the officer Bernd Bormann, the Economic Führer Uta Seim black and Asendorfs citizens, Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors missing - Asendorf have happy: Dr. Frank Müller, on 1 October, the practice of Steel Houses.
While ursel steelhouse goes to the rest, her husband Karl-Heinrich is his follower in the next months still with a half place on the side.
After a rebuilding phase, Müller opens the practice on 12 October until he invests 310000 euros in the rooms at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was a sympathie on the first view when Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who now solved their fabric training in the world hospital and wanted to be in the practice in the next year.
"We always had in the front, that the muscles would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felste Houses and laughed.
"If it was so long, I just called her."
Mother Müller enjoyed the idea to obtain its own practice in Assendorf.
"The nearby and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old mouller.
"We want to know and join the families over the years."
He also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so the muscles buyed the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in brochhouse volunteers.
There is also the double family father Frank Müller, whose medicine studio in Hannover, followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nenburg and Rotenburg.
Today, he worked as a surface in Sulingen, and later he was appointed to the leader notice in the Cryis Diepollz and entailed respectively in the DKB Bruchhouse fields.
Since 19 September, the practice is prepared for the new boss.
While the chirurg Dr. Karl-Heinrich was working as a household, his Gattin Ursel (Interistins) was specialized on the gastermology.
The muscles, both internals, want to leave themselves as a household.
"The endose copy comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the construction, the rooms will look modernly.
We will offer more Ultrashall investigations and long-term ECGs and need more speaking rooms.
Furthermore, the EDV will be completely renewed.
A total committee of 50000 euros has received mullors in the framework of a Fund Programme (25000 euros) and from the Same Community (12500 euros) and of the Community (12500 euros).
"This shows how honour and joy we are that the practice will be fulfilled," says Bernd Bormann.
Some 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller-Gongolol every quarter in the Praxis of Steel Houses, in the northern average practice there are about 500.
In Assendorf there is another household practice.
A positive nearby effect of the practice by Frank Müller: The apothkee remains according to Ursel Felstehouse in Assendorf.
If no follower had been found, she would have gone too.
Anyone who visits mullers speaking hours, still looks in particular in confidential faces: takes the seven medical factors and the cleaning power of the rock house.
With their disagreement in Assendorf, a eroe ends, however, the medicine had been practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we only had two rooms," remembered Ursel Felste Houses smoking.
A little weak will make it a long time.
"But we're still lived in Hohenmoor and many patients will be sure often still seen," says the Internet.
Your husband is full of laughing, "We have a 6000 square meter steel."
"Bisher, I've always been pressing before the garden work, now it could be different."
Moreover, the couple has two singles and likes to go.
Croatia: "We let the flights through."
"Now, the border controls will also be highlighted on our southern border," said Mr. Johanna Mikl-Leader.
The controls on the Ungarian limit remain parallel to this.
As it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylan's contract can also do "self understanding".
The sustenance and security of humans are in the front.
However, it is clear that, "the Ministry needs clear signal," said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration streams, not even on the Austrian-Slovakia borders.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia rejected "Korridor" Slovenia
The Croatian Government had notified before, Slovenia also wanted to continue to travel in Austria and Germany, and also establish Corridors for the flights.
However, this is not the inner Minister Vesna Györkos Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of Corridoren is "absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will mostly intensify the monitoring of the limits - especially to Hungary -.
The borders with Croatia are already controlled as the outside border of the shining room.
As the Ministry mentioned, Slowenin will not exceed its limits for flights.
"Any EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system can't work," said Györkoko Znidar.
As the Croatian Government had notified, the first flights had already been trying to travel in East Croatia at the border Tovarnik/Sid to disappear the registration.
The Croatian police could get it into the near fields.
According to local media, the police vehicles with new flights are still in the Croatian Tovaric.
It is preliminary about Syria and Afganians, including many women and children.
Also salvation services and the red cross are already in use.
In the next days, his country receipts around 4000 flights, Mr. Ranko Ostoic said.
Also, buss from Presevo to the Macedonia-Serbian borders, which had brought migrants to the Ungarian limits, would have reported croatical and Serbian media in accordance with the medium.
However, the Government in Belgrad agrees that it is to show people to attach certain routes: "Whoever we can, we still want to do this," said it.
According to the media reports in the morning, a first bus with about 50 flights in the Serbia City Sid would expect further buss.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The insects were all night from about 500 kilometers away from Mazedonian borders through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungarian has agreed, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the flights.
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This may actually come to a few more westly located strecks in the Balkan Route of Turkey Greek Macedonia-Serbian Hungary.
Croatia: "Incompatibility for border control"
Croatian Inner Ministry Ostioic had noticed that his country had prepared for the case of a strong astromy of fleeting plans for possible exclusion situations.
In addition, he didn't call it, but he said that Croatia was a non-Schengen member "increasing opportunities for border control".
They are carried out strict controls to qualify the membership in the scenario.
Slovenia is attached to this since 2007, the EU partners give good witness to the country since 2007, which is the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, there are about 300 flights behind the Ungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had been moved last night at the transition of Horgos, which leads to Russia.
According to the Uganda authorities, the two borders of Horgos and Backi Breg continue to be locked completely.
If the remaining flights now want to go to Croatian border, it is still unclean.
The Serbian Indonesian Ministry Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reach the midnight at a location show in Horgos: He keeps the debates on alternative routes of flights, after the Ungarn limit is now closed for sale.
There would not be a very high flight payment at this time.
You can't still say if they would continue their journeys on Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help rates migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private ungarian fleet helpers have already started to distribute landscape maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia.
However, the border transition between Serbia and Croatia is not in danger: In parts of the border area there are 20 years after the end of the Croatian War still not explored.
Wednesday, the Croatian police knew that a group of miners was sent in the border region.
Börsen Hacker: Ukraine pays 30 million dollars
Supranonok should have heard about a ring of Cybercriminals, which will be proposed to be reviewed since 2010, in addition to non-publiced financial reports and premises on web sites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.

Ecumenical Hospital Manheim has been 20 years
Round around the Manheimer Paradeplace, rule of rural business.
People gain their concerns, partly quickly steps, partly usefully bumbled.
They guard the two stations of the manheim autosalons at the parade place.
Hold the town front.
Pushing, rule of life in the beautiful herbst sun and in the middle of four large tables even with the title "Before I want to die."...
The Ecumenic Hospital helped this action at its 20-year-old existence and looked out with mistaked reactions.
"It's about life, so we've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lamber.
The leader of the Ecumenical Hospital Aid is also available to the passors for questions and conversations as the honorable cooperators.
While sometimes a spontan passed to the cross, and the stage to "avoid my life", "learn" with the campaign through the United States," " stop the war" or "not long suffering", staying shortly, reading, speaking words like "so far I'm not yet" and then go.
In the context of small discussions on the action, on life, walking with the death.
Peter Hübinger's just before.
"Only if I make sure that the end of this world comes to me, I can live in responsibility," says the director of the diaconic worksmanheim, which is joined with the Caritasverband Treacher of the Ecumenical Hospital.
Therefore, this public effect is good for 20 years.
But if you are understanding, it is finally a very personal matter.
The theme of death and death has been arrested as before with Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospital movement in the past years has been a lot to open people.
An estimation of Angelika Godofroid.
The dead and suffering company is the honorable cooperators of the first hour.
By personal life compared with the thematic, they read a lot of literature and decided to act in death.
When the Ecumenical Hospital seeks to call Hospital, they were immediately reported and had been founded in 1995.
Godfroid is a team of 45 honorable - 43 women and two men - the concerns and partners in private households, hospitals, pneumatic homes and in the Hospital Saint Vincent.
They're all worried.
Angelika Godoffroid can be able to interact well with its task and experiences and experiences.
"I see life from another wait, keep it for costable and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenical Hospital Service is free and Confessional dependent.
Financial support of disease chains and feeds of families and associations allows education and training and supervisions of death and sufferers.
All two years are offered training for new cooperators.
The tables described on the Sabbath are now issued in the house of the Evangelian Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2,6).
There can also be mentioned more personal desires on postcards.
Mixed FedEx Results, Financial Aspects for 2016
FedEx reports destructive results for the last quarter, and the Liefer-Gigant quoted his victory in a whole year because of the hard demand for travel services and higher costs in his ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to get about 55,000 saison workers for the offering.
At this time, in the past year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set up 50,000 saison workers for the expiry time.
The action falled over 2,5 per cent in the Premarket Handel 45 minutes before opening at the Mediterranean.
FedEx Corp. said to win between $10,40 and $10,90 in the business year, which ends in May Next, 20 cent less than the previous preview.
Analysts expected a question of FatSet $10,84.
The smaller view of the prices increases average 4,9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January, although higher advantages for land transports of severe and large packages that will be higher than November.
The company said, however, that the results in the previous year have been increased by costs, higher income, and by the growth in the online-handle.
The Chairman and the CEO Fred Smith said that the company "avoids soldid products, if you are low as expected economic conditions, especially in the fertilization and global trade."
The plans for the feeding employment were established a day later than the UPS Rivals, the plant, 90,000 to 95,000 additional work forces, even the same number as the last year.
In the quarter ended on August 31, FedEx rewarded 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than the previous year.
The result of its action was $2,42 per action, clicking behind the $2,44 per action, which were asked for the 12 analysis of Zacks Investment Research.
The rate increased 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack's analysts expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has described a return in the international priority sentence in the past years, which has carried out the use in his unit of Express-Send.
But the tree in online shopping increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the use of ground transport increased to 29%, but the operational result was based on the basis of higher costs for larger packages and self-sufficient security.
The express unit described higher income by higher price, while the result is due to higher work costs in the aircraft.
In the Premarket Handle, about one hour before opening, the FedEx activities are $3.85, or $2.5 per cent, $1.15.
On Sunday, they closed 11 per cent of loss for the year and 17 per cent under a recording height on 11 June.
On their most expected date in the year, the Federal Reserve Strategy Strategies are two days around this week to sit a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time for the first time to uphold the guidance from nearly a decade.
Drugs on them at the end of the two-second meetings are a wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Food-President Janet L. Yelle and its colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a double task from the Congress: Maximize the US employment and prices here.
But since the great reception, the Fed Leaders recognize that there is a third non-scrited mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandat may be the X-factor in a decision that is too anxious to prevent it. It will be known on the Sunday, if the U.S. is ready to start from the United States, from which the short-term investment of near to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the Economic data show that they are strongly growing, the recent Turbulens at global financial markets may be courageous to the observed Fed representatives, to strengthen this volatility by strengthening the price for the currency - and also to be a fourth percentage point.
"Obviously, the employment market and the inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they watched," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chef economy in the Maker Company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a prospect to not increase the independence, the higher insecurity around the global market is enough right to wait forward," said she.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do to himself, which is increasing to the financial market.
Although half of the economys, which were asked shortly by Bloomberg, had predicted a cyne increase this week.
However, the financial markets expected a expectation of the feed, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance to increase.
This indicates a reach of the Action Market, if the feed increases the stage, although the strategy rejects the battle by promised that another stage is far away.
On Sunday, the Down Jones Industrial Industrial Headquarters of 228,89 points or 1,4 % at 16.599.85.
The action was solved by expectations that the Fed-Polity has set up the set in this week, John Longski, chefeconm in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the feed had the points at this time," he said.
If she does it, "wet she go very far in her statement to raise the financial markets so that they don't go into the panic."
Other experts argued that a cyner increased the financial markets, because they would disappear the unsecurity of the feed.
Moreover, a month ago, the feed appeared in a good way to increase 0.25 per cent points in this month, the first small step in a long-term concentration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the growth in the United States.
Yelle had said in the morning and in the morning that in this year, although the liberal statements had to be more economic progress required to be expected to increase the stage.
Although the creation of workplaces in August was delayed, the improvement on the employment market in this year was strong.
The unemployment cost is 5,1% in the past month, less than seven years and near the level that the feed is considered as full-employment.
Decreases have shown signs of a sustainability.
And although the inflation continued to pass under the year's goal of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main cause was the timer effect of lower oil prices.
The economy, Ian Shepherdson, leader of Pantheon Macroeconomics, says, “the economy can be able to achieve higher costs and need them to be on the work market,” said.
But the financial markets on the whole world have been together last months after China had reviewed its money.
The DOW Jones Industrial average value fell over 16% under its maximum state, as the investors feared that a cross of the Chinese economy would increase the global growth.
The market has received something in this month, where the Down is now at least 10% under the top of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market bullets affect the complex calculation when they should increase the levels.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would not have occurred in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real State and an earlier co-operator of the US Note Bank.
Now he suggests that they will be expected at least one month to get the effects better in the grief.
"There is a lot of insecurity about what the effects of the U.S. science will be, and there are almost no loss data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is no of the main approaches of the Fed, therefore it should not be technically involved in their decision finding.
But in the end the Fifth Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The impact of the central bank was great in the past years.
The only indication of the leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the feed could "company" their monetary expansion, solved the impact around the Globus.
In a world where markets and people's economy are fled together, the Fed representatives may be expected that they should not only monitor the developments in other areas but also consider other central banks and experts to get better understanding for global economy.
Your decision finding is "More art as science," said Zachary Karabell, leader of the global strategy for the enforcement management of the company Investtnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that appear not to be linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a comprehensive member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which uses the decisions in the year 1998/1999, as for example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to send its leadership to 0.75 per cent points in three meetings "increasing restrictive effects on the growth in the United States", said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed representatives rejected these curses.
The Fed should put the aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the marketsum of 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Committee for the Department of the Bank of England.
The recent turbulencies don't come near this level, he said.
"It's sure she's not going to go into the situation in which she's fearing a cinely higher, because the markets get up," said Possen, President of Peterson Institute for International Economic.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until it is changed, I don't think that it should be forwarded to the time.

Brazilian meditrical society Rio Grande promotes food for health silences
The Brazilian Mediterranean Organization SPRS tries to discover women in a shocking way how important food is during the silence time. She does this with the presentation of images of babys, which are lying to breasts, which are designed with unsannified foods.
Mother mill is from a number of proteins, feets, vitamins and cool hydrogens that give the baby all foods they need to build a strong immune system.
According to additional energy requirements, young mothers will be able to increase their daily calories for about 500 calories per day.
Nevertheless, new research results indicate that a higher calorian export is not the only diathetic adjustment that the mother should take.
A current study under the leadership of Robert Waterland, Professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy food of weak women really affects the genes of their babys and protects them before the development of tumors.
I'm sorry, a child’s unhearted food can affect the immune system negatively.
Exceptions for the new Sporthalle
The Common Council of Bernried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euro teure sporthalle.
And he made a exception.
The dark can be flashed for the solar range.
The plans for the long-term tournhallenbuilding at the sports sports are coming for steps: In the recent community Council meeting, the designed construction has been clearly welcomed without great discussions.
The Gremium had decided in addition to another request to a "exception" respective "free" from the valid building plan.
In the "exception", the authorisation for a special form related to the dackbuilding.
It should therefore be established by a "Steatlech with non-middle first and shadow".
The background of the planning is the proposed use of the board for Solar Aggregations: "This is why we get a wonderful southward together," said the citizens leader Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
In the "Freeding", it continued to reach the depth of energy reasons - other than in the building plan - under ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is clearly reduced.
It is therefore necessary for a "freeding" because the construction plan is not allowing "exceptions" as well as the Board's Board is more restrictive for freedom requests.
However, in Turnhallenbuilding, there is no repeated project: "We do not create a prevention case," so Steigenberger.
The tourhallen in the Sport Centre is a Community project of the community and the SV Bernried.
Costs are calculated around 2,3 million euros.
Courts are expected by the training of school and wide ports.
In the next step, the construction request for 18 x 36 meters is now presented to the agricultural general to test.
Clinic Pevetenberg goes to Schongau
The hospital house Pehtenberg will be closed before as planned - in 2016.

The change has changed the reporting of Dr. Andreas Eder, which is only from the beginning of the year the doctor director of the shooter clinic, and now has changed to a private practice in direct near the hospital.
In the question who should follow the following, the name "fisher" came to the game who was ready to take the direction from 1 October and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Shanghai, this means in every case a "review" and an advancement of the offer in the area "inside medicine", so younger white.
Fisher is specialist for heart staff and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized on the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
Over the next two years, fishery with his team shall be fulfilled if the supervisory Council apply to both houses, until the next year the early hospital of the nuts, which is still available over 35 beds, shall be closed in Pechenberg at about 140 years after the next year.
Before the landcreis had planned this for 2018 when the currently running sanction was completed in the hospital Weilheim.
Landretin white jochner, also the president of the supervisory Council, has come to decline in the case where the house that is located in the field of the contract shall be used as a convention for asylum providers.
"I closed it." As it continues with the immobility, the white jochner couldn't say that it had more suggestions.
Currently there is a short-term of Caritas and a day psychiatry.

The distribution fights have been longer started on the German apartment market.
With the coming flights and work visits from the EU, more people have been carried out on a market that has already been carried out in many major cities.
They concurrent with incoming citizens for the last payable rooms.
To explore the demands for payable rooms, it must be built up to 2020 every year 400,000 new units.
To this result, a study will come in the work of the "Sozial Working Building".
For comparison: In this year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's 140,000 apartments.
The flights are no longer obligated to live in an asylum search in a reach.
Many then stand on the apartment market and walk in the long shoes before the meetings.
However, the statistical agreement was less than the half of all asylum competitors in the last year.
However, the negative development of the apartment market is not only the increased flows.
The study also makes significant advantages in the building policy of the last years.
In Germany, there is an apartment deficit that will be increased for year to year.
Currently missing in the balling areas already about 770,000 residences, included Matthias Günther, the author of the study.
Many employees therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed unfreely longer in the "Hotel Mom."
The number of square meters per head in the past years will be reached in the largest cities.
In order to resolve the problem, the construction of "Sozial Working" will make a restart.
This should rebuild the social building.
So it may be reviewed on the basic construction management and the basic rate for promoted rooms will be reached.
Furthermore, attractive descriptive opportunities are required.
The Flight Programme for Flight Affairs of the State Bank KfW is now good at cities and communities.
A good week after the start was already called on Montgomery with 184 million euros more than half of the available at about 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be covered.
Flights have free training: Croatia and Slovenia correct Corridor
After Hungary, there is practically no complaint, there is always more flights on the way over Croatia.
Zagreb suggests to provide traveling over Slovakia to northless.
It's dangerous, but it's still.
Croatia wants to understand the neighborhood Slovenia on the establishment of a curridor for flights.
"I have spoken to the Slovak Inner Ministry, and if it is necessary, we will organize a curridor," said the Croatian Interior Ministry Ranko Ostoic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already in the branch zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a shengen country.
Following the Serbia-Ungarian borders, hundreds of flights were broken to Croatia to go from there to West Europe.
500 people have come over the limits at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV RTL.
Hungary had disappeared his limits for flighting.
New laws that have been in force on the same day are also practically overflowing the correct asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to pass the flights.
The Croatian President Zoran Milanovic explained: "They can travel, and we are prepared for this opportunity."
These people are there, women, children, and men who want to live and get something.
However, there are people who didn't want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first flights at the Serbia border to the EU nearbarland Croatia on the morning.
Most media reports followed by Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and with taxs in the Serbian border City Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they were trying to foot about the green limits to Croatia.
In the Croatian Serbian borders, the flights were not at the border.
For this, the border streams include other dangers: there are still smooth mines from the Yugoslavia citizens war in the 90s.
Mineral rooms should now make a safe pass.
After Hungary, there are no longer fleetings after the cluster of the border.
On Sunday, the police numbered 366 people arrested.
It was 9380 before the Torchluts on Monday.
The new Ungarian laws attach the overwinning and disagreement of the limitation as a criminality.
Thus, 35 crime procedures were introduced in the Swedish City of Swedish City.
The condemned shipping trains to five years and the movement from the country.
According to the information of the introduction Authority, "Transit zones" totaled 94 Asylan contracts, of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Russia.
Thirteen families with small children and two older people are under the applicants.
At midnight, 40 flights were stopped there.
However, practically, nobody more has a view to get in Hungary Asyl.
According to the Ungarian view, Serbia is a "security third country".
The reliable asylum competitors shall be cut off there.
Before the "Transitzone" in Russia, only a few hundred flights were gathered.
In Russia, workers started to drop it.
They gathered the museum who left the ten thousand people in the past weeks on the street border.
Sperrgitters were built and one of the recorders was built in the border.
For the purpose of this construction, no one wanted to be out.
Austria has only been reached after the closement of the borders between Serbia and Hungary.
The country also strengthened its border controls.
For the 20,000 migrants, the Government Agencies were still in the country.
In Salzburg, almost 1400 people expected to travel to Germany.
The transmission from there to Germany was stopped on the former day on the indication of German authorities.
In Freelassing, regularly small groups of flights were found in foot.
The citizen master went "Greate" over the borders
"We were occupied after the bridge feast on Sunday with the room, when ten people stayed with travel victims in the entertainment of the cel," so the burger master Alois Stadler.
Turists, they wanted to go to Pasau.
However, since Germany on the Sunday, because the flight stream was surprised to travel with Austria, it was for them in Wernstein concluses," so Stadler, who immediately invited his assistance and trainers together with two other helpers and their cars over the borders in the near Passau.
Before we have disappointed the unexpected guests just once, with jause and dress.
We just said we've brought them with the car to Passau.
"This was for us self-conscious," so Stadler in the OON conversation.
They were very thankful.
A man was not allowed to give a great speed - 100 euros for the firewall.
"This's very happy to us," Stadler.
The trained adjusters were raised by a ICE in a regional direction of Passau in order to proclaim that the travel transport was established to Germany, but still try to try the limits.
However, the regional ship was departed before the border in Wernstein.
In Wernstein, the overriding border is generally high in the course.
The bridge feast is linked to the bayer neighbors on the Sunday, the day before a two-block sportly-organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayers from New Kirks.
That Viktor Orbán now sends further expenditure to us is a logical result of a visual policy:
Instead of helping structures to ensure humanity, our contracting candidates have been hospitable and publicly pressed the maintenance of the Ungarian Government in the darkness of the National Socialism.
These policies are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions.
The flights also must be determined that the "yellow country" which she has invited and welcomed is nothing than another flight officer.
It will be a great exquisite to make us human available conditions for protective searches in respect of the continuing aircraft and the near winter.
And it will be more greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad on search for 35,000 winterfeat quotes
Conrad has to do all the hands full with the flight disruption.
Christian Conrad is living that his word has weak.
The Government has used the previous powerful railway banker to establish quotes for thousands of flights.
The chaos in the creation center of the traiskirchen has already reached Conrad in the Griff.
"We have no obdacation any more in the traiking churches," he reported about his first success.
In addition, the subtraction of the 20,000 flights that came on Monday to Austria had been successful without a great wind, Conrad said and praised the organizational "master training".
The inner Ministry said that it was a "cristic situation".
Conrad is totally calculated with a need of 85,000 quotas in the past year.
To fill the number, there must be 35,000 undertakings in the next week - 20,000 countries must provide, 15,000 of the agreement.
If it's more flights, we can create it.
"But it's not a fass without the ground," said Konrad.
He has already conducted conversations with the officer of the country.
These would have been safe to make him even for the future flights.
"In Oberosterreich it's good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandart supports Conrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with the Cardinal Christoph Niceborn, where the church will be declared how to help the church.
The asylum coordinator also sets in the ORF action "Help as we."
In the platform, private persons can offer uncomplied businesses.
Also, you hope at hotels that are empty in the winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for subtracting as "excellent high".
Notes may not be that the Quartiers must contain a certain height of the manufacturer or size of the above lights.
For a frequency time, "Notstandards" needs to be applied.
Conrad, based on his experience, based in the respect of the internal ministry.
I am a older master that you don't speak in the face of the uncertainty without any more.
Confirmation power is his most important weapons.
Conrad and Maier caused no costs as they explained themselves.
Their employees want to increase them at three to four.
The proper quality search was not yet successful.
Conrad wanted to create a container in Stephans place as a office.
However, there are clear problems with the approval.
Linz requires a better distribution
First, no opening cities of sports and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the subtraction of flights plans the city Linz.
This is not now necessary, since the interests that are currently involved without these measures, says Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be tested for the accident.
Critically, the city captain in the distribution of flights within the Bundesland.
Other officers also need to provide their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Grenzens are not deleted"
In a longer telephone with the Bayrical Ministry Horst Seehofer (CSU), landesheftmann Josef Püringer (VP) has initiated further progress in the flight question.
The Seehofer has confirmed me that the German borders will not be disappeared.
The further traveling of flights in the Budget Republic is still possible.
However, it is now given the appropriate border controls.
Especially with flights to Germany will not be given any more.
However, the protectors would be brought to Germany with regular ships.
In other EU Member States, drivingers requested more solidarity in the flight question.
Now, that Austria also brings controls to its borders, it is for managers 'a logical consequence' from the progress of Germany.

"We are the ones in the large room of Linz who sold these marks," says the mother of two daughters who owned Italian roots.
Your mode-interest has received width from her mother in the age.
I'm in the most way when something is developed and I can show new trends to be able to achieve prices.
Why a few women are so able to make a beautiful handsheet in disappointment, they can also not answer with the last security.
Maybe it's that a beautiful cup of each outfit.
The rubber of Callstadt
Donald Trump's philosophers came from a place called inhabitants.
This property is also linked to the billioner who wants to be the President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for relief.
If he is foreigner, journalists are aware of the sciences in the international crisis policy, the concurrent for the US president's election war is forced.
And shoot well out of it.
It will also be recorded in the philosophical Callstadt where the grandparents of the immobilian milliard.
The New Yorker with the feetfrissur is a sign in the winzerdorf at the wine street.
Some in the location of 1200 residents are connected to him over-10 branches.
His grandfather came from Callstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in choice mode.
The caller Simone Wendel turned a film over Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his purpose to become the most powerful man of the world?
"I believe those who find that kind of amazing, but they are not so impressed in their call town," says Simone Wendel.
The famous Callstädtine has turned a popular documentary film on the place and its famous springs, with which the Ketchup-Family Heinz also counts closely.
Trump, which is not known for beauty, comes to the "Kings of Callstadt" (2014) also to the word - so with the opinion that he would have been successful if he lived in Callstadt.
He didn't bring it to the king of the hearts.
Besides, it is respectful to the loss of the family, but also tendencyly the opinion that Trump is "for a little big moul", says Wendel.
Absolutely the name of the spitz, the Call City in the area, "The brulljes macher" - to high-deutsch: the offerers, says.
So the Trump comes out of the town of the offerer.
The Trump's success story started 1885, when the later grandfather spent and opened a location for gold grapes in the United States.
Basestone of the Immobilien Concerns were the first basic sale in New York.
However, the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: your desire, a long time to return to the house, was divorced in the Bayer State where the palfish was at times.
He didn't take a Trump because he was unless approved, the director of the Institute for Facilian History and People's Audience, Roland Paul, explained to the film start.
Trump is the single of a "illegal exchanger."
This is in contrast to the undermarked exhibitions of the sequence.
He had repeatedly spoken on mexical invaders in the United States and requested the build of a border wall to avoid illegal invaders.
"It's like the pool, it's not so sympatic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote friend Trumps ("the grandmother was a born trimp, the opa was born heinz").
The winter in the rest sees the American's far far away, "He's always so awful."
He thinks Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He's never worried about Callstadt."
The Pensionswirtin Veronika Schramm states as some Call Cityrs that a descendant of the family Heinz in a visit was sent something for the church horses, which generally did well.
"I can't imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
You find it better if he doesn't win the choice, because he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good.
If those who had the story in the United States were as he said, "When he never came there."
"There's more interesting theme than he," says Winzer's daughter Sarah Büler.
And as President?
"My President is not right," she says.
And, "The smokes will also be reifed without the President Trump."
Wendel's movie, for the tramp long interview, has seen 12,000 kinogeners, also in the United States the interest.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, instead of Nine's trying to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson went to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of Liberal, but there was no great movement in the Today evaluations.
The early show of Nine was explored by the officer of the town when Malcolm Turnbull made the shooter of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armydage, was a part of a weekly series of international televisions, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This part of the distance seems to not play a role for Australian TV surveys, because Sunrise has obtained average 397,000 visitors at the five main cities, compared to Today 339,000.
Today has received a lot of rate to the rate for Monday (317,000) and the last Sunday (283,000), but his number remained back after the last Sunday (343,000).
Today closed the laughs in Sunrise in the last months.
In August, 318,000 in comparison to the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance passed between 40,000 and 50,000.
Previously on September, Sunrise is in average 349,000 visitors to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The wind of the wall is more than the Parliament!

Sam Wood keeps his lips to the end on Sunday
All three women have left themselves in lyrical ways why Wood is the perfect man and called their sense for humor, honour, family values and positive setting as reasons for why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is issued, "When not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers may be to the player who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Yeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both quickly - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
"For the moment I went to the house, and (Sarah) and Sam's Energy, I felt that they were very compatible, and I thought it in the whole history of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with two feet on the earth, it makes so much happy to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they had the right chemicals.
They feel a pleasant and comfortable one another.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be a couple.
From her view, Mackay said that the home visit was clear that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now incredible on him," she said.
And when she was asked to choose who was Wood, if she was not there, she was worthy.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the girls who lived like the same way - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is explored on midnight, 19:30, at Ten.

Detroit and Seattle showed a great interest after his tour in the United States - and there were many other teams who sent after his impressive open training day at the end of the years.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers had been cutting Hayne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a genius, as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga converted at his first point-return at the Sunday 20-3 wind against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-return and also in the running game after a loss of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the clothing cabin after the game.
Instead of cutting his rookies before the rest of the team through the museum, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.

Under the pressure of the project criteria and the FDP Fraction, which prevented the investors and the management of the secretary crymeries, Ralf's respect from the system-bow business management in the opening: "We have no answer to all questions," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to come to all the faults now.
This is about 10 to 12 million euros nice proposals since months in the discussion.
The pictures and new detailed detailed reactions under seabuden beachers who came to the meeting were called forward to the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, Sea Buden Besident and representative member of the interesting representation of the leaders, Pro Heve, claims: "This will be a riesclot that overcomes all other areas."
In addition, he fears as some other project criteria that the transport by the sustainable size of the attachment would be strong: "There must be all busy in order to calculate it," also Schulz.
What exactly happens in a high hectare of the old gatehouse, however, is still open.
There's no manufacturer yet.
"Initially, we have to have a close concept," said Ralf's respect.
Because this is still missing, the building plans are still variable.

Google starts Duplicating campaign to collect 11 million dollars for flights
Google Inc (Google. O) announced a duplication campaign to build 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of flights who have overwhelmed the European nations because they flee from the war and harmed countries.
Google has an unlikely personal approach to the announcement of the spring-offs on his blog.
Instead of a manager to leave the advice, Rita Masoud wrote a Google Middleman who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"In our journey there were many dark towns and bus ships, like hungry, dust, cattle and fear," she wrote.
I had lucky.
But since the migrant crisis grows in Europe, many such as my family seems to be ashamed by help.
The speeds are to four common organizations that provide support for flights and migrants: doctors without limits, International Recue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Flights.
Google said that the first globally collected speeds to a value of 5,5 million on google.com/refuge feed to $11 million.
Europe is confronted with the worst crisis of flight since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year citizens war in Syria, who has lost over four million people in this year.
Many flew also from the Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya broken by the war.

For easy override diabetics, weight loss chirurg may be helpful.
The benefits of weight lossed cheurgy for easy overwhelming people with type 2 diabetes can continue after a new study at least five years.
It's too early to say whether easy override people with diabetes after weight lossed cheurgy live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The death data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of the weight loss chirurg, who wrote a leader article to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas chirurg, use various methods to reduce the size of the massage.
They reduce hungers and limit the corporate capacity to take food.
Over the years, Adipositas operations have been considered effectively, but most studies have been carried out by people who are sick fettleibig with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in relation to size, is used as normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overwhelmed, and people with a BMI are more than 30 fettleibig.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.us.gov/1D0ZqqDv.
For the new studies, the researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital Data collected since 2007 in a study and compared two types of Adipositas-Chirurgie - Magenbypass and Magenbypass - to medical treatment for type-2 diabetes that were easily supervised.
The average BMI among those who undertaken this operation is from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Furthermore, the BMI remained with those who received non-cirurgic diabetes treatment at least 29.
Between those who are undertaken a chirurg incident, the diabetes’ disease was totally resolved at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the medical treatment group, the diabetes were totally resolved in a percentage and partly at about two percent.
Furthermore, the results were in controls of blood pressure, triglyceride and the "least" LDL cholesterin "in general better in the "chirurgical" group," the authors found.
The researchers also watch the patients' blogs of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values during the time.
Hamoglobin A1c is maintained in the best than 7%, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level of round 9 per cent at about 6 per cent.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stabilly at about 8 percent.
But this better "glykemical control" - as you restraint in the best hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce death in five years, so the leader of researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares the average results in the two types of chirurg.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Chirurgie Group was lost more weights (18,7 and 14,2 kg), increased returns in BMI (7,4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3,1 % in 2,1 %) and described more complete overwinning of the diabetes (46,9 % vs. 16,7 %).
While the new study does not show the overliving provisions of the chirurg after five years, there are indications from a study of severe people in Sweden that the operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there was 29 percent of probablely to die in 15 years - compared to a group who tried conventional methods.
Although the new studies did not show a benefit for survival in the chirurg patients, Blackstone said that it was amazing for persons with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation in this BMI group is lower," without high risk of death or inner disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take a serious weight when the patient was with his BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that when they have collected these genetic changes that have fixed their body with fatality and diabetes, it is really difficult to turn."

"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all flights, the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the flight crisis is in the nearest east.
The Tibetian Buddhistic Leader requested to end the violence in the home countries of the flights.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the running flight crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visits in the United Kingdom in his talk, leading to the opening of Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is attempt to the Ethic study.
He requested that the interests of humanity should be provided under the circumstances of the humanity before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also indicated that the reaction of the western European countries on the flight crisis was not amazing, but the situation is not approved.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his conversation.
Although Dalai Lama Germany and Austria's efforts praised in the consideration of the crisis, he stated that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousands of flights, it is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions, however peace and real development, mainly by education, can be created for these Muslim countries," said he.
Lastly, we need to consider how death is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," added.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of violence, and also commented George Bush's trade after the terrorism on 11 September, and explained that the violent reaction of the United States was a chair of uncontrolled events.
After 11 September, I expressed my bicycle in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is in violence.
"I know, his motives were good, but he set in violence, and it has made out unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-free increase of the use of manufacture infections by children in the last 4 years
In the United States passenger control centres reports about a nearly 400 percentage increase of the number of children under 12 years, which struggle alcohol defects, as well as Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of use of manufacture infections in children under 12 years, reporting the target control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"It's always more frequent to these products, and it's a percentage of them to go in the adoption," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children have to drink infection, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a courage test in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young deinfection tools just drink because of a lot of life.
Young people have missed the defection medicine with alcohol sustainable water to obtain a worse restrictions.
Students children can be locked by attractive defects of deinfection.
"A child doesn't think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the attractives (Hand deinfection) are those who are parfumed.
There are deinfections with land beer, wine wine and orange duty that are very appropriate for children.
Man infections contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, a few spruiters may lead to alcohol supply.
"It's the highest concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Geftnotrift Center in the hospital of Kansas University, the Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let the Whisky cut up, but people let these hand-deinfection equipment in the riches of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick opportunity to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-year-old girl who had been taken to treat the treatment of four eggs from the ground-bears in the school.
Your bloodal cool concentration was 179, twice higher than the shirt, which is legally applied to a adult as drink, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an advocate doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nahaijah left her words, and he was not able to go when she came to the attack.
The doctors watched night in a separate childhood hospital on the signs of Hirn-Traum, since the girl fell through the alcohol and stopped his head, said Ritchey.
"This was very hard," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could be killed for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol free products or defects and to load hands infections outside the river of the child.
In addition, some defects were linked to death accidents.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after the conclusion of hand-infections, which enthyled a toxic, non-declared advantage.
Health authorities agreed that the product methanol contained a mortal solution instead of ethylal cool, which was noted as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York planted their "geneous" teachers, by exposing antibacterial products around the education room," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic against the hands-infection and disappeared them out of their room.
The police considered the required plan as "contributions" and extensive discipline measures to the school authorities.

Why I am a witness of an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except in a later legal intervention, I will see how a man will be brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it's not happening, I'll sit in a supervisor gallery in the death room in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is explored by the gift price.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses when he died.
The invitation had been successful first in January over his best friend, and although I was shocked, I was true.
When the day was near, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do that?
I was right because I thought it was a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death suffering.
It would offer a single perspective.
It is true that journalists can see offices in the United States, and there are often more reviews available than places, finds a potential lottery instead to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of media locations of 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit near Richard Glossips a friend with which I have developed my own relationship during the months with telephones and a two-minute hours of visit.
I like the guy.
We're laughing so much when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a staff to write what I see.
I just need to try to remember me all details.
A journalist of Oklahoma accused me to get my independence on Twitter.
Here's the lection.
Tell the story of the heading how he wants, and you get access.
I threatened me with her.
She dreamed that she could "the better form", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would do it.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses every time.
But he wants to have an international reporter to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the public work of movement will be helped to the death train.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit near me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of Podcasts I have done.
I don't want to go back here to all details.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would cause him to be a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think it's a strong chance that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's no evidence enough to justify a dead judgment.
I think his guidance is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't mean to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to which you can return.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man's unnecessary death.
Man after fired police persecution year overcome from Canning River
The Canning Vale police stayed smoking when he spoke to the man from Canning River.
A trial of a man from Perth to decline the police was unfortunately when he found himself in the worst and suffering water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "no to turn back to the ship."
The police of Canning Vale was called on Sunday to a householdfriend breakfast in Beckenham.
When they discovered the losers, they tried to get them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water-- and said, 'I'm not come out, come and get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not very concerned to make his uniform gas, so he turned to a suitable taktic - "A good police treated."
"It's sometimes do people happy things to try to escape," said Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an incomprehensive example.

Peter Moody says Stewards tried to spending him and to finish the rent port
Peter Moody said that Stewards tried to install a spion in his villages in the past year and tried to finish the rain immediately.
He raised the Stewards and the integrity distribution of Racing Victoria and said that they were carried out a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a rentage treatment, the last training at the midnight.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the rent port and he has imagined himself under several conditions as to the positive cobalt top test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He was 18 months away because of the spionage property and didn't want it to "see how to be too high."
"I had proposed to say nothing, and I sat long on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out once," said Moody.
You know it's gone.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live to what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to turn up the head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying to try my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, then I shouldn't be trainer.
Then I have to think what I'm doing to my licence.
Before Moody left the bomb in a interview with racing.com that the integrity department tried to spending his stage.
"For eight months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will take up when I'm asked - and sent him an employment in my tents to give information about what I'm doing within my fields," said Moody on Racing.com.
They believe that I'm a liar.
If this is the case, they should be sure to take up their nose because they have pronounced me in the trying to steal.
Robert Roulston, before. President of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were known for that time, and it is still today.
Would this take me to the view that it will be personal?
Has the RVL been fair and may make people responsible for what is in the branch?
I'm bad for the branch?
I'm so bad for the branch?
Maybe people think out there I am.
Maybe they have to take my licence and cut me off, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying, let them think about it now.
But now I'm coming to the point that it's not about me, and that makes me crazy.
That makes me really sad.
I'll take the pressure on them and put them down to take a decision.
I have my family support and I can go.
The Frustration levels of the trainer have built with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to that he said he could "the licence on the table."
Moody, the best known by his preparation of the unconstructed Master Black Caviar, refered to the Rentags treatment rule "laughly" after a packing slamm or sound on the horse bodies, which was attached to the rules.
"It's against the rules of the rent port.
I have to take the full responsibility for that," he said.
"A one of my employees has raised unrecommendly smooth on the feet.
It could be so yesterday evening.
It would have been the whole day that it could be like that.
But it was so on Sunday.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualiation for treatment with the package on the Sunday. An investigation was opened.
It's a witch.
People who make these rules do not know about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but this is too far," said Moody.
A man arrested after traveling
The police arrested a man at the weekend after a meeting with a railway and later traveller in Cobram.
The railway was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with severe diseases after he was found by a car on Sunday morning on the Murray-Valley car.

The advice, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital, and he is in a stabil state.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy smokes against rivals because Ring fights
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has marked critics on the tackling of his player as "Agenda-Setting" of two Premier League Favorites of NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the judges have allowed the storm gamers to fight with his team during the high storm-shops in the quality-final in Sydney's freedom.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a short note at the Storm Team after his husband had obtained the final spectacle against North Queensland Cowboys at the Samstadium. He called the game a "moster game" of Rugby League and said that the two of Queensland would not be "to good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his husband and said that they were concentrated only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criteria of two leading trainers at his manage was considered aware of him because it means that they were concerned to be struck from the Storm team.
"This is always up again - I didn't hear that Trent Robinson spoke about Ring fight when they shoot us 24:2," said Bellamy on midnight.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing on our defense system or techniques all year, but in the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real heavy point, and that has made us the need for the treatment.
Trent is now there since three years, and he obviously has to train a great manage, so he is probably not usually to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already complicated how it's always shown back in this year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea from the "spanning football" and remembers that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "langweilding" football.
Wayne says about the springing football.
He compared his game in the Same Stageing with our freedom and how nice it was her game," said Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized as a long-term team in 2010, and Wayne said he's gonna worry about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we're looking exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this issue in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy, therefore, added that the game Storm against Roosters made a higher result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I didn't still see it, but what was the result? 16:12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more trials in our game, but is this a nice game?
Or are breaking and no points amazing?
It's the game plans for me.
If they tell us, it means we will still be in a phase.
The Storm Team is free at this weekend, since they have won the right, or the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks at the next sample in the prefinal room in the AAMI park. The ticket sell starts from the next Sunday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 Drug Attachment
A man who may have a long-term trial caused his trial to come in the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaïne who were cut down to Queensland was released against a $200,000.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the contract police found the drugs on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America on Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maxmovic was observed how he found his contacts in the jachthouse during the former day and later in Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Instead of a possible long-term trial for trying to possess a commercial quantity of cocaïne, the lawyer of Maximovic argumented that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole quantity and that in the cafe could be a fair reason.
The judge in the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the aircraft at Maxmovic.
He has clear relations to Serbia.
He often goes to Serbia," he explained the court on the midnight.
In the case of the crime, he promised the police about his residence.
Maxmovics mother and steel fathers offered a cutting of $200,000 as a security joint to get its freedom.
"After reading the proper statements of both persons, it is clear that the establishment of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial charge," said the judge Flanagan.

Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when he was sleeping, logged in a online message service from which he received a number of unexpected images of children who were sent to him by another user.
The girl waited later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.

The mass makes it: all two years show the car building on the IAA their news.
2015 is to ensure the movement in the compact cars which are particularly good for now.
Autos from the compact class are now particularly asked: Round 28,1 per cent of the new authorisations depend on the power-drift contract (KBA) only in August on this segment.
This is also reflected on the IAA (Agency Day 17 to 27 September).
In this year, among all the futurist concept vehicles and new high-class and Luxus autos will be presented in particular many new compact models.
One of the largest premises for the German car rental is the Opel Astra, who is standing at the handlers.
"The Astra is a very important model for us," said Opel-header Karl-Thomas Newmann on the Messe.
He's the brain of the mark.
In order to sell the volume model, the new astra should not be much more valuable for it.
Opel sets an increase under the largest competitor VW golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra contains a new 1,4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.

Other than the most important competitors VW golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra first only as five officers.
The second variable will be followed in the morning of the Combi, which is already in the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Aster on the IAA still to the new compact car?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-Concurrents Megan in the streets.
On the Messe, the Megan is only to see as fifth officers in a conventional and relevant Sport GT version.
In the trade he comes in the beginning of the next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: Totally new in segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan resident wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
In this case, the compact Infiniti is fulfilled with its exposed lines in the design line of the mark.
The basic dell will be obtained by a benzin engine with at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, there is also a diel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in Segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who feeds his world prims in Frankfurt.
The model with benzin engines, including a new developed 1,0 liter turbo engine and a distribution of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum movement is followed by manufacturers at 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The start of the baleno in Europe is in March 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but run renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which is to see on the IAA.

Furthermore, on the IAA in the compact class, a number of transactions and new variables such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin egg: Five square meters cells are human increasing
The Court of Agreement has given a ex-management of the Justice Completion Institute Tegel, which was undertaken in a monthly amount of a small cell.
Since the loss of their human warms, the heads were essentially responsible for financial disorders when they are carried out to small cells.
This has decided in a decision published on the Mediterranean.
The concerns may even hope for the judges if they were locked for a few days in the rooms (e.g.: 1 BVR 1127/14).
It was successful that a ex-healling with his consistency in Karlsrue: He was undertaken in the juni and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of the ground; the toilette was not strictly separated.
Afterward, the man, who was put in a larger cell after the details of his lawyer, was in the middle of free feet.
His officer's mission was separated because of the unbelievable conditions against the country of Berlin.
However, the officers raised the court of the room court of Berlin and showed the case to review there.
You're seeing the man's human beings hurt.
Cammer's headquarters are now resolved above the height of the disaster
Even if for legal reasons of the question period only a few days of feeding for debatting, it was given a comparable intention.
In other cases, it would be "the protection of the right protection of personality."
The room court must now clarify the height of the money disease.
The officers have already increased the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they just said to a heading smoke in April because he was locked into a cell.
Human increasingly, a decision from 2011 is also the multiple position of a cell without separate toilettes.
Karlsruhe confirmed that on midnight, in order to confirm the Berlin Court of Consumption, which had confirmed a challenge in a parallel case in November 2009.
The daily claimer was undertaken over three months each day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in Carlsruer case.
The Berlin's prisoners were also in the last weeks, as well as because of missing persons.
Thus, the prisoners will be concluded again 23 hours, which increases aggressivity, even to sloggers, it will be already due to the increasing situation.
After the expenditure of the Justice Press, 21 items are not placed in tegel because of the passengers, 19 shall be removed 2016.
Angela Markel and the flight policy: "We create this"
The adjustment of flights is a great requirement - the contracting candidates are decided to accept them.
What's going on to Germany?
800 000 asylum competitors will come to Germany after the Prognoses of the Agency Ministry in this year, after the exhibition of Vizekanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is still in place to take a million flights.
The contract cancer Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated the irregular conclusion requirement: "I say again and again: we can create it, and we can create it."
The following subsequent surveys are submitted to Germany.
It is used after different prognoses between 350000 (Evaluation of the Tree Instinct) and 400000 (Evaluation of the Pestel Institute) apartments a year - and the next five years.
This is almost double as much as it is built before (250000 rooms).
Dramatically, the loss of residence, but especially in payable miet objects: annually falls 60000 to 80000 social apartments from the price, and for these special favorite apartments will also be able to run flights.
Budding Tree Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore will duplicate the promotion from 518 million to a billion euro from now.
A lot of less is the view of the Pestel Institute: 800,000 social habitats must be able to exist a yearly, and the agreement has to invest a contribution to 6,4 billion per year.
One of the scientists and the branches of the offices are in which it also needs to provide more investments in the building of the room.
After assessment of the Institute for Working Marketing and Employment Research, it is that 55 per cent of the aircrafts in Germany can be compatible with long-term.
However, the flights in Germany would not be systematicly asked after their qualification to help them when they get up, criticized Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsman Office.
However, the integration of flights is determined if they find work in Germany.
Working is the key for social contacts, the assessment of the taxture company, but also for the self-valuable feeling of the advantage, says the Migration Research Dietrich Thernhardt.
In Germany, Threnhardt has given a political condensation: from the work prohibition for flights to recognize work.
While there was a job prohibition for asylum competitors from to five years ago, it was reduced in November 2014 to three months, as the resident obligation, which the asylum competitors restricted to a residence.
In the society, even because of the competence of forces, most of the view that flights should be allowed faster to access the employment market.
A great courage for access to the work market is missing German recognitions.
There are not yet sufficient offers to general and professional language courses.
Researchs also show that workplaces are often distributed by personal contacts.
The establishment of networks is therefore according to the view of Threnhardt of the king's way to integrate the work.
The Berlin School Management has stated that only few fled parents give their children to the kitchen, estimatedly ten to 15%: "For the designed parents, it is just a very important to maintain the family," says Ilja Koschembar, speakers for young and family in the Berlin Senat Management.
To convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the Management Management is distributed in various languages.
If the need for explorers increased by the great number of flights, the Berlin Senat would try to increase education capacity - even by allowing more schools.
In the countries, students are prepared without German recognition in welcome classes.
However, they will not always be learned of full educated teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers who have only a quality in Germany as a second language.
There is no need for them, says Beate Stoffs from the Berlin School Management.
The German student work is estimated that about 20 per cent of the flights in Germany want to study.
Principally, there is no contracting asylum competitors or patients in the study - the only exception was at Berlin, Innensensor Frank Henkel (CDU), but now he has set his treatment.
Student fleeting may improve access to high school.
Because flights with a residence or dulling are no longer offered by the asylum competition service when they start a study.
Lasts are essentially no bottles, because they do not fall under the cross of the cross.
Patience flights had to live for four years in Germany to be authorized by Bafög, from 1 January 2016, this Spanish has been cut off for 15 months.
However, these financing happiness must be closed, require steps Krach, the State Secretary of Science, and the German student work.
The students should now get baptized.
The Islam will now play a more important role because many flights are Muslims, and for many religion is the important part of its identity.
The State should reject the same rights as they have the churches and continue to develop the existing State Church right to a new State religion relationship.
It would also be important for the establishment of an islamic good-bying contract that is professionally careful for the innovative collections.
The rights are also obligations.
So the representatives of the Islam must be some and ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to introduce certain control options.
It is also the preparation to prevent religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslim, Aiman Maziek, exceeded the worry, religious conflicts could also be income to Germany.
Those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany said, "their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bayerian round function.
He proposed to translation the basic health to the Arabic.
The integration will now be more than today as a subject of the whole society.
It also needs to change the majority society, and the creation of discrimination and racists will be decreasing.
However, Germany has - as the result of European decisions - since a tenth button is an anti-discrimination stage and a general equation.
However, it learns very late as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities, the rassistic motive systematically ignored.
The same opportunities for all: What migrants organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans require longer and what international agreements such as the anti-risism Convention of Germany should be effective in the next years when the country remain peaceful and uses its new citizens and citizens their opportunities - for all of them.
Generally, Germany is in place to provide medically for the expected flights, President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man power and capacity is, we will create it," he said to the day speed.
However, for additional money, it is necessary to put into the system.
In order to deny the shipments, Montgomery requests to deal with all recommendations as well at the registration of health cards.
Recommendations may be calculated later with the contract countries.
And longer it is the most fraudest, so many people with the restricted delivery catalog that prevents the asylum competition.
Furthermore, they make the doctors in particular the language barriers.
Before, Berlin's health scientists have shown thea Borde, migrants will be discovered worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinicals, even in doctor practices, it is requested.
However, many flights would have been helped to help with more general medical exploitations in the needs bombs.
And with another diagnostic view.
Below flying skins, it is clearly more unbehaviourable, and the young people are going to make an HIV declaration.
The German doctors of their training, however, are clear that Montgomery.
"Parasite accident or tuberkulose are not so hard to recognize." And whatever the doctor's manage is, it may be even lending in vision by flights.
The Syrians had a high-developed education system, some flights were also doctors.
In order to practice, however, they must demonstrate their quality and possibly reduce tests again.
At least half of the flights arrived in Germany are psychic diseases: most of them are in a posttraumatic disorder or in depression.
Especially, the flight skins, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study of the TU municipality states that every fifth syrical flight skin is traumatised in Germany.
A person who is sick in a posttraumatic disorder, includes the same named flashbacks with atemnot, swindle, heartbreak and death.
Other symptoms are sleeping and concentration diseases, strong fearfulness and emotional skills.
To prevent that the symptoms would be chronic, if an early treatment needed, stated munz.
Nevertheless, only four percent of the psychic crazy flights have been a psychotherapy.
As psychic cranke asyl searches in society can make a request for a psychotherapy, however, the processing is mostly several months.
Furthermore, most of the social media editors or doctors who have not been educated for psychic diseases would decide whether a treatment is necessary or not.
This leads sometimes to feel assessments, says Munz.
Many dreams

Zimbabwes Robert Mugabe contains false talks in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the oldest leader of Africa, fell down the beginning of the year from a podium.
He stayed unexpected, but the video of the case was quickly expanded on the social media.
The opening of the Parliament has also been made by the agreements of the elections of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths, and they were warned to apply the request of Mr Mugabe with officers.
In the past month, they had exhausted him and interrupted him during his talk on the situation of the nation in the Parliament - this is the word he repeated on Sunday.

FC Arsenal Captain Michael Arteta says that team colleges have to stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the lost Jack Wilshere
Wenger said to Wilshire that it was only September and if his rehabilitation moves to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Friday.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshire will be sure the next four games for England and that his story is a party in the next room of the European majority.
The great challenge in this current problem is that Wilshire had finished the last saison after a separate disease, and then he had reached back to his old suffering during the prevention.
"This kind of destruction doesn't hurt the Carrie," said wenger.
It's a dog that doesn't well healed.
It's not a biggest matter.
This was just a accident.
It wasn't connected to his kids or the losses he had before.
This may be true from pure medicine view, but as wengers also recognised, there is the relative danger of other losses, always when a player trys to return in the middle of the saison.
It also develops an unbelievable pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd describes 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debt six years ago.
He also played in only 65 Arsenals 157 liga games in the last five games.
The larger image for the arsenal is that they were in six of eight times since 2007/08 one of the two Premier League Clubs that have been signing most destruction days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil cross, but Arsenal believes that a improvement in the destruction cost will be run during the last saison.
"When you come back from a loss, you have a random period, a time you have to strengthen your body and win the battle," said weep.
Jack's young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body is stabilised, I'm sure he's gonna do it and he's going to travel a carrier from the type he's rewarding.
Arsenal begins his Champions-League saison at midnight against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Sunday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey are not going to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should be started.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nano Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the equal weight and to the players that need to enjoy a small break," said the weeping.
Although the Arsenal is clear to continue through group F, the maximum station in Zagreb is the game places with the greatest surprise effect in Europe.
Dynamo was also missed after 41 games after the "invisible" campaign was started in the last saison.
The station was shocked by a landscape at Thursday evening, both measured on the jurisdiction board 3.2.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is the opinion that Arsenal has gone from the past saison with the Champions League Capitulation against Monaco and remained remote hope to lead the agreement to his first European pokal triumph with his management.
"This operation is immense," said Winger.
It's never hit in the Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm too long in the business to be realistic.
We're honorable, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comdy-Show, which gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The missing of similar figures in shows is obviously, especially in view of how the need for men to open, now more disturbing than ever has become before, as self-smoking under young men on a 15-year-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men in 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom, and it remains three times often in men than women.
The campaigns Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against a serious life) in 2015 as the year of the man, with the objective to make the culture in question, the men intend to search for help if they need them.
Friendship is the heartstyle in fighting to master this requirement.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school schools with depressive symptoms stated that if the sufferer had a sufficient percentage of friends with "excellent vote", his chances were doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a cross of holy healthy friends takes risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you must have only one time friends to work a friendship.
In the period of the communication on social media, with its heavy point on the style of substance, the immediate responsibility of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life had the need, strong, sustainable, and successful, even if the isolation is really dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by the name of the psychological extrinsical values; money, image, social status, everything on intrinsical costs - our internal property for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more deeply.
And as a video game finder and a billionar explained shortly, money cannot really buy happiness.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which was raised by interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequencies, moments at the football bowls in comfortable seats and the seed of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can take care of it on every case, even if they have a lot of time to find their feelings completely.
As an employer of the phone series explained to me, "My audience role for people who feel depressive and are dangerous, has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends.
The old speaking use "I'm going to justify" has a great effect as the feeling that it will be considered as difficult if you speak openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the meaning when I try to offer longer evaluation mechanisms.
She presents very clearly the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective side status on the phone can help people in the moment of distress, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit the comdy Central FriendsFest at this weekend, with the entirely renewed clubs of the day, why don't you take your friends to drink in the Central Perk.
Or, better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, give him a song and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can do.
Friends are sent to Comdy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria tried to help PSG to destroy Malmö
Angel Di Maria feeds with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his threat against Malmö.
Di Maria travels at her debt in the Champions League on Sunday and helps PSG to go to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held Kurs as Paris St. Germain started his chambers League Saison with an outside comfortable 2-0 travel against Malmö in the principal parktown at the Sunday.
Di Maria found less than four minutes after the beginning of his chamber League Debbots as a PSG player, who brought the French master on the way, but then they overcome a number of opportunities before they finally increased their presence than Cavani in the 61. minutes.
With real Madrid and Stockjor Donezk, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, because they are not only trying to achieve the quality for the K.O. rounds, but a improvement on the way to the fourth finals in each of the last three chambers.
But while they got the points, there was no class game of Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics before the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and the agreement with which he had already started his illustrious carriers in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or outside in the Champions League. That's why it's a good start, 2:0 to win to cause our neighbors problems and to refresh the problems, even if there's some things we need to perfect during the saison," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, although I doubt that we haven't yet received one or two other gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his loss in one of the three changes in the Paris team, which, at the end of the weekend, could keep on its own place against Bordeaux in the first Liga, but in the fourth minute he was disappeared by Di Maria.
The argentin flyer was named as the man who could take the PSG on the next level in Europe when he was taken in the last month of Manchester United, and he declared why he entered in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö Protection before he had finished Johan Wiland in the long horse of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would make a great effort, he was deceived.
Malmö, the Celtic struck in a play-off to get this level, stayed at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a fifth man-defence and two deep in the middle field a severe gas.
But outside a shoot of Nikola Djurdjic, who was along with Kevin Trapps Pfostes in the 34th minutes, they had little in attack.

Since we just played in the Sweden Liga that doesn't have the same level.
The qualitative games are not gained."
Get out of Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Rom now has a Martin Luther-Platz
Button 500 years after the reform is now in Rome a Martin Luther-platz.
In the presence of the President of the city Ignazio Marino was baptized on the midnight, an unnamed place in the park on the top of Opio on the name of the German Reformator.

Hammer Artist invested three years in the Bible’s personal interpretation
Jesus with the Dorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt designed for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
The word was first?
No, not at the Otmar's old library, which is now appeared with precious images.
In the beginning, it was the image of Otmar Alt, which formed in 150 motives his full personal interpretations of Bible history on paper and living.
His "spring" with low colors and fantastic forms has received the 75-year-old - but nothing is equal to "leading" images.
In the same way, the subjects applied, it can be directly affected.
Three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he found a subjective artistic election from the many theme areas of the book of all books.
The understanding is cycles that arise themes like cross paths, smokes, commands or fathers.
That is why he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This is applied to the Luther's flag with his theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler's floor with his heavy point on art books.
And in particular, the author Klaus Altepost, who has set himself on the basis of the malrei with the similar Bibles.
He interpreted the selected Bibles by Otmar Alt and so in today, in the current connections "translated".
These texts are like verbal speeds of Alts Malei.
They are entered between the original Bible of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who forms all his personal thoughts in the situation.
The smoking band has gold letters.
So the 75-year-old age doubles a deep view in his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimity.
Emotions were recently excited for the Bible's project: Otmar Alt, 1940 born in Wernigerode and growing in Berlin, comes from a family who listed to the serious protestant officers.
"It's already happened with the rohrstock," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work on this, so that I might have been with the Father's Lord again."
His second point is to help the art in rapid time again to more position values: "The approval of images worlds has been raised today, and it is loud.
The symbolic is dismissed there.
Artists have another pleasure and wonne to show things.
Images always have something secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard I am a dinosaurier."
Otmar Alt wants to let the viewer in the images "income", let them act, discover, and feel what power they have: "The image seeks his way."
Klaus Altepost stayed on the Sunday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "I'm always" being a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like, how he understands his images."
Alt had not considered to fully consider the Bible, but those who were important for him, also secretly topics.
"This wasn't a cooperation on the eye height," says Altepost, "This is about the images that the text only explains." The understanding is a photographer library.
For Hans Möhler of Luther's flag, this work is an invitation to "their life and to find freedom."
Otmar Alts photos speak for Möhler as well as the (biblic) languages of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original papers and lending images - is first presented in a statement that is opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Stitting.

DFB intensified income for flights
The DFB raises its commitment for flights to 2019, which the contract constitutes a clear sign at the weekend.

"Then no one can say in the principle, that's nothing to me, I don't have anything to do about it."
"This must be interested everybody to get this subject in the griff," said DFB-head Wolfgang Niersbach.
When annual meetings with the contractskanzlers Angela Markel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensify the flight situation in Germany.
"I'm next Sunday in the Cancer, and I'm meeting the Ministry of the State, Mrs. Ozozuz and the Kanzlers."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he said.
The football can help.
However, the decision-widgets must be set out in the policy.
The German football contract has therefore extended its flight initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.

"We also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkussen's Sport Chef Rudi Völlers of the "image" shift (the day) and refers to the proposal as "self understanding".
"The flying drama's goes everybody who can't see anybody."
"We can have a football officer, no, we need to use our driving power, our influence and our opportunities to help many flights that have already been able to help," said Hertha-manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's officer Peter Rettig said about a "prominent sign of the Liga".
To the EM-qualifikation game against Hungary at this freetage, the National Management of Women's 100 flights to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach marked the support of flights as "the great Community football".
That all 36 licences had started in their locations, be great.
It is also great that small and smaller agreements are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have given, will live in the football.
"This is a big meaning," he said.
In this and next year, the connection with the DFB election and the Agreement Government is available for the integration of flying flows.
"The United States have already rejected the total for 2015," reported Niersbach.

Roboter Autos: Government wants for Germany
Germany should be a technical preference after the will of the agreement Government at the construction of the car.
The Budget Cabinet decided to be a strategy from the house of Mr. Alexander Workingdt (CSU), which includes other investments in the digital infrastructure.
Goodindt spoke on midnight in Frankfurt on the border of the IAA cars by a "new mobility citator".
The automatised and networked traveling will increase transport security and care for less stairs, said Goodindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his office colleagues from the G7 states that are also in the IAA representatives of the industry.
The Strategy Paper of the Transport Ministry includes the importance of the mobile breedband output and a positive approach to digital hearing.
For the test of new technology, a test track at the car train 9 in Bayern is now.
In order to “avoid any additional risks of achievement”, the Agreement Government will "see the legal framework conditions and where necessary to apply new developments."
So Germany wants to use along the international way that the allowed maximum speed for self-secured cars from 10 to 130 kilometres will be added.
The Agreement will also apply to a change of the Vienna Agreement that is only a traveller for humans.
In automated travels, the car takes the leading, the vehicle will be more and more to the pass.
The technology is based on Sensors and cameras that get the environment and process the data in second speed.
After a study presented by the Economic Ministry, high-automated travels will be technically possible.
However, without traveling vehicles on public streets are "wait only to 2020".
The creation of values in the field of vehicles and the high-automated vehicle functions in Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 at about 8,4 billion euros.
"The digital network of the Pkws can lead to more security and efficiency in the street transport," said the SPD Transport policy Seren Barton.
However, the question of detention in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the vehicles must be clearly.
However, the German self-keeptic cars are still seen more than French or Americans.
On midnight, the Forsa Institute in the work of the test organization Dekra is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom cars will be carried out in the next ten years, 32 per cent calculates only in 20 years, 31 per cent does not believe over it.
In France, 21 per cent of the demands are calculated with autonomed cars, in the United States 33 per cent.
Unless the vehicles in Germany are still not ready to leave themselves completely on a self-coated vehicle.
After a highlight of the digital bitcom bitcom, only seven per cent would apply to the control during the whole travel.
On the car trends, it may be considered at least 15 per cent in the flowing transport, at a level 45 per cent.
Every four would leave the car the control under no circumstances.

Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It's a mixing from a very large modem vision and a growth-figuring box: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has introduced an explanation on his work on the midnight in the munchen.
The height points: Scope pups, which looks seriously to human beings through video projections.
They take the spectacular creations of the French Designer, including Madonna Bjnenutfits, to the great star of the modeses - and that he stole men in rocks.
"I can't say today that I'm the wound of the hot cow, because I have white hair."
"Previously it was left, among it is real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the citizenship on the ship), which is to see from 18 September in the artehouse of the Hypo culture, it is a happiness that the model creator has changed his beginning to a look over his person.
In fact, he was worthy, because he said, "For me, for a statement, a little after death," he said.
If you die, you're going to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Canadian Montreal and in Paris station.
"It's about so much more than only beautiful clothes," said the director of the art hall, Roger Dieders.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and vision of a open society.
The Expounds give a view to the work of the man who has written the modem story, without having ever solved a training.
Chronologically the look is not built, but she is a pretty pretty crossographed entire artwork that has been operated for a lot of exploitation: To refresh the pups, for example, a stylelist has been engaged.
14 tons of material have carried the makers after the data of the Curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munchen.
Before the beginning of the Oktober Feast, there was still a special shinkerl: a leaderhosen outfit with Corset.
Heidi is madonna.
He's always interested for strong women ("Frauen are slower than men") and for people who are a little different, said Guultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy also is to see in the exhibition.
He's for the first, amazing modical research of the Designer.
As a child (which wasn't a good school and bad in the football), he attached his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Guultier.
With a puppet, his parents wouldn't allow him.
The design of mode he then taught himself later.
He got a moderate record and looked at the design of other designers as Gaultier told in Munchen.
After that, I bought them, but of course.
He can't pay the models for his first own modem view.
They didn't get anything, but they had to keep the climates.
Smuck instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as Mode Nice
Previously, it came to the long stick machines and to smooth to make meters.
The manufactured substances and spits were in a large number of customers who, for example, continued to deck and gardens.
This is not working alone today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, employer of the modesty rooms.
Instead, the mode is more important.
In the beginning pages of the spitze mode played a larger role, then the home textile industry was declined - and now it will be discovered as nick.
Reinhardt calls some examples: Spitze in smuck, in accessoires such as boards and regional trains.
In general, the same Vintage mode, which is considered in the past styles, is a positive task spotenial.
Whoever doesn't take Nish in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market.
They're already carried out the half of all tasks with us.
Modespite rooms are together with nine other companies in the branch-binding rooms and stickers.
Only they can take the protected label.
In the past 15 years, about 80 per cent of the use has been interrupted.
Private businesses and large trade are almost no longer.
Our products do not get customers on this way.
The massageware will be produced today much more biller in Asian room and almost exclusively on cats.
Furthermore, the export is currently reached to Russia and to the United States.
It's also a good reason for new ways.
The broadband also tries to point through environmental knowledge, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "For this year we bring a quality cycle that shows that we produce environmentally and socially."
Reinhardt fulfilled: "This is also related to the materials used."
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches the Snowbergers outside the West Saxes High School Zwickau - on the factory for the use of art - and is specialized on steckers and spits.
To make the competition of the Asian space, you must find high and innovative products.
It needs time and strength.
It is a scanning field between the most fresh ideas of the designer and the operations that must especially think economically," Schmidt says.
That is why a existing design often is only easy to maintain a customer.
A few years ago, the textile designer Kati Reuter renewed the history of snowballs.
That's the machine in some places, small kitchens.
The pure goldsmime master Bianca Hallebach's race inspired it: "Therefore I could never start with traditional shops."
Now they're using the snowball slots for their smoke.
In an outstanding procedure, she provides the pattern in silver.
"More people in the region identify with the theme Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
She also provides in the United States, Australia and Finland, especially to customers who have lived in rooms and environments and wanted a reminder.
I'm going to see my smoke as modern newspapers of the Spitze.
Disney plants a new "Mary Poppins" film
You don't have to worry, but Disney still looks at a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, it does not mean "Entertainment Weekly" about a new film, but for a type of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic kids.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the family Banks at the time of the World Economic Crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews, is still unclean.
But the register is already fixed: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in Kino.
Xi needs to open the economy more widely for the world
The Economic must be opened further outside to promote growth, Mr Xi Jinping said on the Sunday of a group which was offered to reform.
"China should be used to lock outside investments and knowledge-how and improve the business-based strategy," he said in a consultation at the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group for the extinction of an increasing reform.
In order to promote and prevent reforms, the new weakness and vitality will bring and offer a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has agreed a number of directives, including a negative list for the regulation of the market access, the discharge of border control policy, the promoting the State Affairs (SOE), to take a private capital, and to maintain the maintenance of the resident community system.
After the statement, a negative list identified sectors and enterprises that do not be questioned for investments.
The system will continue and be baptized and improved by test programmes.
The initiative is significant because it contributes to the market a greater role in the participation of resources, ensures a legal national business environment and opens the market, said the statement.
The Government will also lock controls on the companies carried out and take care of the companies to decide how they lead their businesses.
The Statement also said that China's border areas would be allowed to detect new models of the transfrontier economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the framework of a proposal to open public controlled sectors, further areas for private investments will be opened.
"The Government will not change their policies against external investments and will protect the legal interests of foreign funded undertakings and make better services for them," said the statement.
Furthermore, foreign countries, it will be easier to ask for a permanent residence or "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and to improve the concurrence process.
The law of the applicants to ensure their activities and to ensure professional judges and officers, was also discussed at a meeting.
At the meeting, Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders, such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, participated in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double Quecksilber green values in rabbits
The European Commission wants to double the border values for quick silver in large rabbits, and the consumers will make a clearly higher dose of neurgency.
The consumer organization of Foodwatch, which provides a corresponding workspaper of the EU, criticized the plans: "The risks and environmental impacts are continued to continue with full growth on swallowers and small children," said Matthew Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Following Wolfschmidt, the limits of the neurgency fish for the large fish at the end of the food sheet, such as the hair or the sword fish from the "economic policy reasons" from one to two miles of quick silvers every kilogram fish.
However, large fishes are now so strong with Quecks Silver, that, on the basis of the limits still applied, they cannot be sold about 50% of the beginnings.
After duplicating the limit values, only 14,5 per cent would be unproduced.
In accordance with this location, the EU will smooth the border values with other fish at the time of 0.5 billion to 0.1 billion cycles per kilogram.
But the Foodwatch marked this as "Trick", because smaller peace fish, as well as some carpen are most lowly loaded that they have the planned maximum values already now.
The absence in small fish is therefore "a perfect manager of exploitation that helps only the economy," explains Wolfschmidt.
The Queck Silver is a higher gravity metal for humans, which is achieved on the food sheet, especially in rabbits.
The Agreement Government therefore warns that "for small quantities, especially in the unborn destruction of the nerve system" can be caused.
The Agreement Ministry declares its homepage in view of the maximum values applied that a "health risk of the general population" is not expected.
The Queck Silver has been in particular through the coal burning in the environment.
The German coal capacity works are referred to in a written achievement of the Department Minister of the Convention on the Green Budgets of Annalena Baerbock over six tonnes of Quecks Silver in the year, two third parts of the total numbers emitted in Germany.
The concentration of Quecks Silver in fish even in Elbe, Rhein and Donau was "continuously and flexible," the "splay" quoted in March from the paper.
In the past year, European warnings before the Queck Silver in fishing have already been numbered to the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
