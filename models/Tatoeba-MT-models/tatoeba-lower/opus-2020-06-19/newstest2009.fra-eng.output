In terms of changes, the Bascula Prague bourse in the negative
After the morning breakfast, Prague's bullshit reacted its losses.
Transactions with the CEZ actions are at least half of normal quota changes.
Mardi, since the beginning of the switch, Prague's bourse renewed with her shoot of the guard, when she lost about six percent.
This time, the bottom is caused to shoot actions in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market against the result of the vote of the American representatives room, which refuses to adopt the scheme of stabilization of the American financial sector, is also perceptible to us.
Association of Actions in Asia
The Asian bowls have married a dramatic smoke, even if the instructions succeed during the day, to eliminate a part of losses.
The Hang Sang Index of Hong Kong's bourse is lost four percent during the changes, but later, he deleted a part of the losses and reduced the bottom at about 2,5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index after the movement of Chinese actions in Hong Kong's bourse is lost 3,8 per cent, the markets are closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's bourse actions were lost more than five percent, but finally the losses were achieved to reduce the losses to 4,3 per cent.
According to its index, Taiwan Bourse lost 3,6 per cent.
"The hesitation on the United States' safeguard action will affect the financial markets of the whole world," observes Joseph Yam, the chief of the Hong Kong monetary officer.
Although Hong Kong was part of China, he established its monetary policy himself, it is independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates are in Hong Kong the same level as in the United States.
According to the first Australian Ministry Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should quickly retreat the negotiations and adopt the proposal for support of the financial system.
Furthermore, other countries would be risked.
The blood bath of American actions
Monday, the American representative Chamber denied the financial system's support project, where it had to be saved to 700 billion dollars (by approximately 12 billion of Kƒç).
Legislators thus rejected the call on the support of the project of President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
American actions live, lunch, blood bath and main action indexs know the biggest challenge of these 20 years.
The Down Jones Index lost about seven percent, with a struggle of such envergury for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when he appeared that the proposal was not adopted, he was in free challenge.
The Sede Congress: the Government of the United States can inject 700 billion dollars in banks
The American Congress and the Government of the President George W. Bush had agreed on a larger form of the financial assistance agreement in the United States financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators made a decision-making tour in the parliaments on the adoption of a safeguard plan under the form of a financial aid of $700 billion (amount of $12 billion), provided to the American financial system.
The success is not so sure.
In fact, before you can publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the Agreement.
The support plan of the financial system will be examined on the next day at the room of representatives.
This is the Sunday Agent Reuters Barney Frank, President of the Bank and Financial Regulament Committee.
According to the sources, the mercredi at the past, the plan should be first submitted to the vote to the Senate.
According to the economists, the announcement of the fact that the safeguard plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to raise financial markets.
However, when the complexity of mechanisms is given through which the aid of markets can be effective, it will follow a "desillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have accomplished a great progress.
We have set our different opinions on the form that should have the market stabilization package," the Bloomberg Agency trusted the Nancy Pelosi Democrate.
According to it, the final vote could be carried out since Sunday.
In the Sunday Sunday night, representatives of lawyers met the Minister of American Financial Henry Paulson to give the Government a final form.
This should be reviewed in the financial society, investable immobilier activities that carry out financial enterprises in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in its totality.
"We are on the point of agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue this plan to restore markets, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The World Financial Crisis has significant impacts on action markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators do so that the Congress takes a definitive agreement since Sunday.
So they want to calm the investors before the beginning of changes on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congress decision could affect lunch changes.
However, for now, it is impossible to determine with confidence when the two rooms of the American Congress will proceed to vote, or if negotiations are not risked to be blocked, at the last time, by such or such a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted during the future.
However, the law will still be known to the most important changes.
The total quantity of the system to help the system must be divided in two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But, if the Congress will have the impression that the programme does not complete its function, he has the possibility to lock the retained amount, in two steps: first 100 billion billion additional, and then to end, 350 billion dollars.
Mr Bush welcomes the progress in negotiations
Although the Chairman can put his vote to this Decision, the Congress, he has the possibility to put this in minority.
Despite these amendments, the main idea of the programme, which consists of achievement of funds for the rating of bad immobilier tits, such as the threat value, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not intended to pay their hypothecs.
"All work is done.
The Chamber of the representatives should be intended to procedure on Sunday at the vote of the Law, and the Sunday Senat," indicated the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The President of the United States George Bush is his own joy of progress in negotiations.
His por-word Tony Fratto stated that Mr Bush was the content of the progress on the Sabbath and approved "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of the painted parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of the Senat Christopher Dodd, leader negotiator, said that the legislators have agreed with the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of the contributors against losses, the decreasing agreement, the deployment of the plan on the age.
The new law also provides to limit the ground-based parachutes for society directors participating in the programme and establishs a committee that will ensure the monitoring of the fund.
This last should be maintained by the Ministry of Finances.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made important progress to a agreement that will walk and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides aid for immobilier owners, which have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new accounts in the case of the hypothecs that it will be reached, although it declines the debitors monthly and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but his realisation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are ignoring what is the mechanism and the price of the rating of problems.
This point will be determined to break on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week, on the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is now adopted, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not, according to Marek, not so important that it is.
"It is much more important than the congressmans agree, since this week, that they support this plan and they will save it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the Agreement, preventing the adoption of the plan, is most important in this time," underlines Marek.
An extreme battle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While practically all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 Player can phone.
It seems to be clear that it's better to buy only a phone.
Although there are enough reasons to look for a independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a hot game phone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
In one part, such musical products do not go out on the wine disk, and, from the quality point, there is no objective reason to happen.
But if there's in your stairs of wine disks, with Rock, jazz, or blue, you dream at least likely of such a graphphone.
It is like the music during the moves, to know of the compressed music, to say it simplely - from music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be inacceptable to spend eight thousand corones for a reader, as a fan of Pink Floyd would have a bad support of auditors accepted for twenty corners on the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough place for everyone.
The choice is large.
The life of battery is also decided
Some high music readers are capable of much more than a simple music reading, but it is there of unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is so universal as well as the phone.
Besides the first functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is capable of reading music and movies, to record these lasts, it contains a variable quality photo device and can, for example, be used to navigate.
And if we take the Smartphones and communications, you'll have a small computer in your box.
Since no fridgeer can grill from the flesh and no television will take photographies, we are practically assisting a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without unconvenients.
More than the number of functions you use is big, more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy gains.
The mobiles that are able to read from music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases, this number is very low.
In this regard, music readers (specially the most rudimentary) are very more performing.
In the case of good market mobiles, consider that they will not play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you will be called time in time, ask, to be up, a second reload for the work - this is even valid even for the most loving devices.
The problem will not be placed for MP3 readers, which are capable, after a reload, from a continuing function at least 9 hours, including the less performant.
Another problem occurs during the recording of music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of devices has a USB connector, more than all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can store music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know if you take it without reduction, while you are given the small sizes of memory cards used in the mobiles.
In regard to readers, you don't need except exception (iPod), no software.
It is enough to fill through the USB connector the music device from the computer.
Most of the mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpret, the title of the album, the style, or then after the jurisdiction of the user.
Some devices show only a index with a tree structure, as Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cown, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more knowledge-face
In the choice of a specific device, especially interest in the life of the accumulator, the capacity of memory, quality and type of exit of its and, of course, the facility of the command.
If music is for you, essentially, a background sound and if you're going to listen on the day only for a limited time, for example, taking the tram, you'll have enough any MP3 mobile reading.
Practicely all the mobiles are capable today.
You don't even have to take care of music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
Everyone comes to read the MP3 and the big majority of the music that will come to you will just have this format.
It is part of the most expanded formats and the largest majority of the devices are also reading from the WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods) is less current.
High Game Mobiles also allow online music accompanies.
It is enough to be visited from the portable phone, the web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service should be a convinced reason to search for a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately misfortunate, and it is limited, in most cases, to quick radio tubes made.
The prices are not more low.
However, it is generally considered that this way to buy music (which is by GSM, the Internet, the Internet, which is free) will dominate musical industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out the mobile of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
But it is also important if you always have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated loads, which are practically all the mobile, but a minimum of MP3 Players.
For many, the main benefit of musical mobiles is their price.
The less favorite costs usually less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand corners, we can have a workman already very convenable.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for regular auditors.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also caused by an entry for regular auditors, does not exceed more than 15 thousand.
Readers, in contrast, have the better to have a easy command.
Really, no one who is going to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which does not correspond to the less favorite (e.g. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the comparison of the command with the boxed position, shortly used in the past, or a graphphone, is clear.
There is no collision risk under the form of a mobile internet branched by hasard, followed by a large data transfer factor.
The device to select
Even the less favorite mobiles (e.g. Vodaphone 527) have generally a slot for switchable memory cards (M2, microSD, and then).
Even when you take the additional accommodation of this card, you won't go over two thousand corners.
But be careful.
Base templates support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the lovingest are even out with memory cards of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a good MP3 reader, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or well a iriver.
In accordance with capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to expenditure more than 1100 corners.
If you are a part of the most required auditors, choose more than specialized Walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are made of independent command keys for MP3, and it is so that the equipment of the command is closed by a independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, including the workman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one who has gone the farest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (before 16 GB) and a life duration of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, to 35 hours) is assured by a MP3 reader produced by one of the above marks.
A first virtual operator will win the Czechian this year itself.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech is relatively advanced, and our operators, practically proposing the same services as their partners in West Europe.
Despite this, we miss anything like that - a virtual operator, which would strengthen the classic operators to low prices.
He can't miss him for a long time.
We have already called on Mobile.The fact that the Cheques operators are part of the most favorite in Europe.
The CCTU (Tcheck Office of Telecommunications), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our home than in the rest of the Union, was confirmed.
Thus, after the last none of the European Commission in the rules of the regulation of roaming reliefs, a paradoxic situation to produce - the SMS sent from the foreign will be for some of the technical mobile operators less favorite than in the country.
How is it possible that the prices in Czech retain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, it misss a competition that really wants to enter the battle.
This can appear paradoxal, because we have even three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds about 100%.
In addition, mobile operators like to declare that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, Paul Dvorzy√°k, Chairman of the Chec Office of Telecommunications (CHTU), who declared several times that there was no more place for another operator, carried out with operators.
It's probably true that a classic operator with his own network does not seem to be more happy (only now, he would only find frequency).
But there is still a chance - a virtual operator.
It is just the introduction of virtual operators on the mobile market that has introduced a significant low of the prices, which should then react to classic operators.
However, before even the entrance of diseases such as T„Çπ„Ç≥ Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, sounds like those we hear today have been listed to us in Great Britain.
But it appeared that he remained from the place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are also not obliged to go for too far to find examples.
On February, we had informed you of the launch in Poland, the virtual Mobilking operator.
Only six months, this operator had successful to win over 100 thousand clients and to become the fifth operator of the country.
Let's add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which has the U:fon in Czech.
The advancement of virtual operators is the possibility to concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be effective, they really need a lower client than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempts of construction, exploitation and maintenance of the mobile network, relatively highly high.
So in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-free operators - they propose good markets and SMSs, which are often contralated by a limited service offer.
For example, Tsco Mobile proposes, in England, SMSs at least two times less than their competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland, the setting on an inhabitual target group can also be a good offence of publicity.
In fact, this operator looks specificly for men.
"The real men chose Mobilking - a operator who pleases them and who they can trust," said David Sebirert, the Mobile Entertainment Company CEO, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such concept would be appropriate to go home too.
Miroslav ƒåepica, Vodafone's door-wort, sure: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, based on the most of the virtual operators.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the view of the offer of services."
In Czech, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it seems almost sure that if there's a virtual operator in Czech, it's not Mobiliking.
"We discuss the expansion of this project successfully, but the negotiations in Czech are not very promoting.
The launch of Mobilking will be located in other countries of our area," says in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studniƒçkov√°, port-word of the Penta Financial Group.
She did so immediately confirm that the operators in Czech are not favorable to this idea.
In contrast, they were trying to do everything they could, so that a potential competition could not appear.
The GTS Novera group, who would like to prevent a new step to become a real telephone competitor in the field of business clients, does not hide, since long, his intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have much to be intended to propose our clients not only for fixed telecommunications, but also mobile services.
And the latest will be the best.
We have already sent negotiations on this opportunity to several times with the whole of the technical mobile operators.
With some, we were successful to progress in negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl group's port-word.
So the future may be promised.
According to non-official information, it seems that we may be able to achieve the first virtual operator already here the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is with a total silence.
"In this time, we don't think there's a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared with other very specific.
For the moment, no subject of a complex and serious project in this area has not contacted us," Vlastimil Srsch≈à mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also report the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrov√°'s port-word states in a rare understanding with the O2: "We have not registered for the current viable and bilaterally advanced project, which could be based."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network here the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited time, we should now have a specific agreement."
Vodafone leads its attention to the compliance of requests to obtain its own licence 3G.
Miroslav Cepique says about this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructures.
This means, according to us, most of the customers' view points.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is the detection of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The extent of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entrance of another operator would mean a higher competition, would have carried down the prices and thus below their benefits.
What is so good to facilitate the event of such competition?
When it's their interests, the operators can hear themselves as flaws. The girl who join the U:fon's creation is also witnessing.
The largest pressure on the CTU, when the U:fon creation, was exercised by the T-Mobile company.
Providing accessible information to the public shooting of the CCTU web pages.
But today, the U:fon is ready to use as a argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov√° noted that: "The competition on the mobile market was, more recently extended by the entrance on the market of a fourth mobile operator.
With the character of the mobile market in RT, it is evident that the entry of an additional player would submit it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
However, the attitude of the mobile operators that here is, the indifference of the technical regulation organisms appears to be denunciant.
However, it is not only the attitude of the CTU, which, in contrast to the Great Britain and other developed countries, has no doubt the power to intervene in the economic competition in Czech.
This is exclusively the Office for the protection of the economic competition (UOHS).
However, this last adopted, face to this problem, its typical position.
"The introduction of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned on the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded for the time, because the offer of potential interests has not been present enough interest for classic operators," said in our answer to the question of Christian Chalupa from the Department of Foreign Relations of the UOHS.
A statement made so would not be surprised by the representatives of operators.
But from the part of a office, which must represent the interests of consumers and among others, also take care, so that no one benefits from its position on the market, such declaration is more than derounding.
Furthermore, Christian Chalupa adds: "To the foreign, where virtual operators normally are present, they can be sure that their entertainment on the market has contributed to a lower prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the meaning of an honest market function and a lower price is not a part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually smoking is the nearly touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which disappears their reactions.
The question, if it's really a hazard, it's naturally.
In the same way, a price of the essence strictly identical to all services stations is certainly due to the harm and the hard fight of competition.
"The office has not reached signs of an anti-competitive management, therefore there is no reason to intervene in one or another way.
No operators have a dominant position, therefore no one has a suitable responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunication regulatory," stated in his Chaloupa statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the numbers of discussions.
However, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by the CTU, as the telecommunications constitutes, from the view of the economic competition point, a single market.
No technical operators have a dominant position on such market.
However, some of the right experts propose another vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, each time it is necessary to obtain the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has enough logically the monopole on his network.
It is therefore necessary to play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activities.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least concerned for the UOHS that three mobile operators will proceed in a similar way.
However, many interested statements (including the GTS Novera company, already mentioned) show that they face, in negotiations with all operators, analog contracts.
Returning the responsibility on the CTU is a sufficient tour in communications, through which the UNOHS is laid down the hands of the business.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
It was unfortunately not succeeded in the innovation of the telecommunications law, adopted recently, an extension of the CCTU powers on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This, the representatives of the UOHS must be very well known, but their interests are apparently different.
When nobody looks, it can go
This says, the functioning of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, many in the Cheques mobile networks, remains unpreviewed.
It is businesses publishing their own list of mobile phone services prices, but these last are not only public.
In most cases, it is a question of firms that are concerned with multi-level marketing.
Special telephone services are also proposed by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and well others.
The price lists of these firms are generally only the elections.
The magic tour is in the fact that the company makes before the operator is a classic company client, which commands a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important client, it gets special price offers (and other).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all technical mobile operators are prohibiting such revenue.
"If it was happening what you said, it could be a transgression of the contractual conditions we would examine and who could take an end of cooperation with that company," answered Martina Kemrov√°.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such activity has not been done until the responsible for the mobile operators.
Note that in the case of the three companies mentioned may be thousands of clients.
One operator, however, is not pronounced against such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring their non-negative benefits, and at the same time, by opposition to true virtual operators, they do not mislead them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Cepical indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such specifications, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of negative clients.
Moreover, these are contrary to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not recorded under their name, so they can't be fully available in the way of normal clients of mobile operators."
Well, it's exactly that should be strange to the CTU.
Furthermore, there is another question in the UOHS.
If mobile operators shut their eyes on such procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has relatively large powers to devolve such a activities, and if it does not want to please the explanations of operators, which, in doubt, have no idea that it would happen, their contracting conditions would be interdistributed to him.
When we're not the lovingest country
As we have already called for several times, the input of virtual operators on the mobile market has brought a significant low down of the price of the services.
However, practically in all countries where virtual operators appeared, classic operators were forced, at least less, to stop their creation.
The arguments used by these lasts were practically the same - a small market, seen too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is exactly at this level that, in developed countries, the regulatory organisms, which defend not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
So by formal measures as well as by an informel pressure, they have finished the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the technical regulatory organisations treat this question in the form of a calamity earthquake which will be deleted by transmitting it to a near target.
Following the experiences we have, we can't disappear from the impression that the confusion in competition is in these cases more than profitable.
But don't let's get the miss after the cogne.
If the couls information say true, and a virtual operator will appear shortly to us, the Chec mobile market may be moved in movement.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UNOHS would only be difficult to remain inadequate to the reject (in discrimination) of other interested interested.
And we may have been able to call more loving than in the rest of Europe.
The New Chec Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four realizations of the new version of the Czech National Hymne.
Wednesday, on the date of the Day of the Czech Nationality, the Prime Minister Mire Topolanek presented only the new records of the National Hymne Kde homev my home (Where is my country?).
The hymne has been recorded again by the Orchestra of the National Teatro under the direction of Jir√© Belleohlavek.
We have four versions - with a single man or female sing, an interpretation with heart and a instrumental version.
The cant is achieved by Catherine King and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Krƒçak are the authors of the himne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Belohlavek consists of the national technology as one of the most beautiful hymnes.
As he had already trusted in the Czech Displacement (the Czech Public Radio), he chose to interpret only versions of songs with young and representative voices, which are marked and approved.
"After the beginning, I tried to take care of what the two songs, and the heart, have a good word to understand the words, that they can sing simultaneously," he said.
The National Chec Heim will celebrate, next year, its 175th anniversary.
The Cant Kde my home retenit for the first time in 1834 on Stavovski divadlo (the Teatre of states) in Fidlovaƒçka (Kermesse des salvators), the original cheque room of Josef Kaetan Tyl, along with Frantischek Schcroup's music.
He became popular and people were spontaneously appropried.
After the creation of the Checoslavaquia in 1918, the first couple became naturally integrating part of the national hymne.
He remains one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the Independent Czech Republic.
How's the "new" hymne?
Common transports (MHD) will introduce, merchandise, puce in their biller system
The Friday 1 October 2008 will be insert in the history of the Prash Additional Podnik (the Agency Prague of Transports) as the date where they will go into the metro, trams and buss of the first passors, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their box.
At this time, this last is accessible for at least 100 thousand people, owners of the Opencard map.
Travellers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the time to record it on their puzzle cards in the information points and the offices of the Trade Underport (Agency of Transports), located in the metro Museum, M√∂stek, N√°dra≈æ√≠ Hole≈°ovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letinia, Kobylisy, Rajska Zahrara, Kaƒçrov and Luka.
Since yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying the cups by Internet on the websites of the Training Company: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who begin to use the online magazine can be forgetted definitively forget the guidelines in the metro stations, where they should be pitched with impatience in long cookes in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coffee through Internet and store it on their Opencard map in one of the thirty Citysca library (Municipal libraries).
"In these points, there is a guichet with a formed person, which will help the interested persons with the Internet acquired and, in addition, record the coupon they buyed on their card," said the port-word of the project Martin Opatrny.
Besides the libraries, it will also be possible to store the electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the board of several metro stations.
What does these distributors like?
They are red, recall the machines to compound tickets and travelers may have already noted them in the metro Rostyly, Budijovick√°, I. P. Pablova, Florenc and Vttavska stations.
"Today, the city has five, but from here the end of the year, it should have fourteen," added Opa.
A car will control the coffee instead of the chauffeur
The cars that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It's enough to introduce the Opencard card and the first buyed coupon will save himself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the cities.
Aware of the perimeter trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are essentially used by the inhabitants of the Central Bohemes to access capital.
"In the integrated trains in Prajska integrated train (including transports of Prague), controllers are equipped from card readers, with which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the bills Philip Drapal of the Ropid Organization, which consists of the time of transports in common practice.
Periurban bus are equipped from card readers in the box of the chauffer.
In the shipment, it is therefore necessary not only to show the box card to the box, but also needs to put the Opencard on the location specified on the side of the box.
So the chauffer controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"In the case the past would need to check the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask these information to the chauffer," completed Drapal.
Passors who don't take the perimeter cars and don't remember the date when they expire the validity of their coupon can reach the automatic distributors, initially used to save the coupons on the card.
It is, on the screen of the device, which will show information about the validity of their document.
Swedens claimed a reference to the United States
The Germans of the Sweden asked in 1945 to be integrated in the United States.
This decade of a letter posted in the collections of the Jihoczeska Scientific Library (La Scientific Biblioth√®que of the South Boheme).
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States patron of America.
In 1945, some of the Southern German groups were intended to address the President of the United States with such a desire.
This decade is between another letter stored in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho≈°ska Scientific Library.
The Germans of Czech Krumlov pray in the letter that the President of the United States should not allow "shumavaska jupa" (Region of Forests in the south of Boheme) - announced by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - or delivered to the Checoslovaquia.
"We have well understood the situation, and we want to be sure that the words proclaim that the American teams come on the German territory, not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators, are written in the letter, "Persons, in which the sort of Sumava is in heart."
Since the raising to the Czechoslovaquia is not promptly promising - with the knowledge of the national technology - but of brutality, debtness, incomprehensibility, oppression and service, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take in his hands the protector of the Sumaba for now and forever.
"We can't believe that you will give this territory to a stranger State to us, who has punished and destroyed minorities and has not contributed to the victory of the Allies without considering the opinion of the four million people," is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the "Th√®k oppressors".
If the President of the United States had dealt with the opinion of the Germans of Shumava, it would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a reference in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States or live under the United States patron.
Although the text contains in the letter, it takes account of the current knowledge of the history of the next-government, it appears to be a little naive, according to some survivors, it explains well the attendants of the German Germans of the Southern.
While the Germans should at least put into account that the question of their exulsion of the Republic would be raised, very few of them would have been such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the United Kingdom would get a certain type of autonomy for the Sudanes.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The festival journalist of the Australian Gustav Chalupa, nor in Czech Budajovice, confirms it.
During the war, this was, as Alemand of Czech Budajovice, entered into the sea in Baltes countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region's capture camp, the tenths of the German Germans came to consult him to teach them the Chec.
"They believed that whenever the cheque returned to them, the cheque would be profitable to them," said Chalupa.
No of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovaquia before the war, according to him, that after the Decrets Bene≈°, he would be exhausted from the Republic.
You don't think you're paying!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The action regarding the most costing road safety in the Czech History.
A way to characterize the emotional medical campaign as the intention of launching, mercredi, the minister of transport.
The office of the Ministry Alesh Rhebiƒçak believes that she will encourage the conductors of a dangerous manner.
This campaign costs 150 million TV, radio, digital, online, but also on tracks.
She should deal with the drivers of the fast and alcohol at the flight.
But remember them also to take the ceinture before starting.
She wants especially to touch the conscience of young drivers, motards, pioneers, without forgetting the professional drivers.
What will happen in the spots?
Especially personal history that will attack emotions.
It also shows the "slogan" of the whole campaign:
You don't think you're paying!
The phrase "You don't think" is increasing in capitals on the immatriculation board.
Then, in a blood flake, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize that it can be paid from life a moment of interest.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry inspired analog campaigns in the English Saxon countries, where it can commonly see images with drastical images of the victims of accidents.
It estimates that this would be a low-down of accident rate and the number of dead on the Cheques routes.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and fute strategy against drivers
"Whoever walks with the drivers, it's the sugar and smooth system.
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by the fact of winning time, when they burn a red fire.
The fucking, it's the threat of an amendment or accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," says Martin Korz√°n, the psychological of the hospital Na Homerce.
That is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative publicities, including psychological.
The panels sign the danger to the drivers, according to him, are less effective.
"Which a statistical panel that keeps on a danger is installed, he probably will quickly fusion with the environment and the drivers will not notice it anymore," signed Corean.
Olmert would take peace almost all occupated territorys
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli provisional government, was also announced for the refund of all the occupied territorys in 1967, including the Cishordania, Jerusalem-Est and the heights of Golan, in exchange of peace with Palestinian and Syria.
He made this statement in a public interview published by Jedioth Ahronoth day.
"We must take a agreement with Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make nearly all the regions (occupied), see everyone," said Olmert to the day.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we must cease Palestinians an analog percentage (in the Israeli territory), because without this, peace will not be done," added.
He admits that the possible restitution would understand Jerusalem-East.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and especially desires that tractors and bulldozers strike him the feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, should be rejected to the parts of Jerusalem," noted Olmert, having committed to the two attacks in the city in July, when many people were killed and tens of violated persons.
According to the first Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historical places" located within the city.
"Whoever wants to keep the Israelian sovereignty over all the city will be contrary to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It's not going, "It's not going," he's sublined by the time.
Golan Height Retraction
Olmert also pronounced the retrait of Israel from the heights of Golan, which is, according to him, an essential condition in order to conclude a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also need some efforts in the part of Damas.
"I'm not proposed to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retrait of Golan," he signed.
"The Syrians know very well what they need to renew to get Golan.
They will have to renew their current relationships with Iran; they will have to renew their relationship with Hezbollah (movingly quiet); they will renew the support constantly that they are given to the terrorism of Hamas (Movie Movie), the Al-Kaida (the terrorist network), even from the Djihad (the Holy Guerrement) in Iraq," was the first Minister.
Questions that come after the accident: are the stewards in the case they're illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is interrupted
In the context of the tragic accident of the automobile of the Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, surprises the question if stewards and passors can be moved during the tragedy within the autocar.
"If we wanted to respect the law strictly and formally, the activities of a steward is contrary to the law on the road circulation," says Karel Hanzelka's transport minister.
The case, during which a 22-year-old host was lost, appeared to be caused by the driver of a car who cross the road of the car.
The young girl was at this time unfortunately sitting near the chauffer, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
However, the autocar may have a accident, it's brutally frozen, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the journals.
What is important is if the autocar is on the basis of its technical fish equipped with locations on or not.
If this equipment for places is not homologated, the passors must remain sitting.
The long-term autocars of the Student Agency does not have places; what has been confirmed at the currently.Cc by the director of the company Radim Janczura.
"It's a question we've trained with the Ministry and, at the beginning, he prohibited all the movement of the passors.
Then they canceled it, and we got that the passors can go to the tolets during the traject that they had their own seat," he devoted his position.
The law ignores the steward
"No uniform legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirements are concerned about this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription is prohibited to the transporter to propose services.
The Road Transport Law only knows the term of a vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and debts," adds with more ambiguously the Hanzelka port speaker.
Josef Pokorny, the Director of the Department of the Road Road Cars, estimates that the law is sufficiently treated with the problem.
"All depends on the fact if the autocar has the permission to propose places in its approval.
Everything lives in there," he said.
The carriers are divided in towns, where there are locations standing and a maximum limited speed, interrupts with locations, and a higher allowed speed, and in long-term cars without place stays with the highest allowed speed and equipped seats of security seats.
As in the air, a expert said
Jaroslav Ho≈ôen, an expert in BESIP (Router Security) in security in transports, does not see the movement of stewards on the board as a major problem.
"In a regular circulation there is no danger; the situation may be compared to the service in the aircraft.
There's not any more, it's not sure when a turbulency is produced and the airhouse can be cut off the head."
"Or, in the case the autocar would have broken hardly, physical laws would be obviously valid.
In the same way as in a town bus or in a tram.
The transporter must management the safety of stewards by internal requirements," and also estimates that the problem is not regulated from the view of the law.
Janƒçura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only car transporter to propose stewards services.
He's busy two hundreds.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consist of their rate as a risk mediterranean.
"Anyway, when I will impress that it's a risk measure, I will remove it.
Passors can receive their coffee and their journal in the market.
This would also decrease the fractions," he said.
The security assets is the reason that it gives the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of Asiana Alexandre Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very reduced number of lines.
"We don't have hospitals, we're opposed from the beginning.
A long or later this will end by a dead accident," he said, a year ago, in Tiden.cz.
A great tragedy has arrived
A young hotel in Plze≈à region, who worked for society two years ago, was lost in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovakian truck probably removed the urgent stop band without using clignotant and locked the path to the autocar.
The chauffer of this last to try to escape it through a broad manage, but he round it by his right side.
Janczura refused that the two seats reserved in the rest of stewards were sold.
"In the case of a long distance line, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company accounts to steal against the driver of the car.
For the deduction of the family of the young girl, the agency will not expect the judgment of the court, but in the case of financial compensation, it also takes account of the crime.
A change of the law?
Not View
An amendment of the law, which is intended to be developed, a group of 30 experts from the Minister of Transport, could bring specifications on the movement of stewards at the autocar.
"Or, she didn't conclude any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she doesn't interest too much for the bus, but instead of the point system, the maximum speed on the author and the use of the portable to the flyer," said the expert Ho≈ôen.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards as a thing that would be based on the safety of passors," concluded Hanzelka's port, in particular that the control of autocars' safety is under the police and office for the safety of the work.
The hopes of the D√ºsseldorfos reposes on Francfort.
The major words were not missing in the letter addressed by the Officer of WestLB to the home employees.
With a unit of D√ºsseldorf Financial Institute with the Deka-Bank of Francfort, "the Central Institute of Financial Marketing of Sparkasse" could be established, according to the Monday public report.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" duplicated of a sustainable productivity in such cases.
As a result, such a relationship may be the decision-wide sentence to other concentrations in the banks sector of the countries.
It seems that it seems when a direct committee is to demonstrate its capacity of action in difficult times.
Because WestLB, worried, is still a strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority of Financial Services, which has, recently, clearly understood the Government of the Northwest Rhenania country that the time was in search of a future solution.
However, it is a question since a few years ago - also on the side of Francfort - a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, who knows the Sparkasse clients by their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas did know when the Numbers of the end of August, he saw no sense in the fusion of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a country bank, as well as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Administration Advisory Board, which each half is supported and by the banks of the countries and by the groups of equipment, was carried out by the Director-General to lead passengers with WestLB in order to common trade activities.
It may then be of the debt of the financial market, or parts of this.
However, the parkers are just starting, and they are said in the financial place.
It is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, takes account for one of the most important employees on the financial place of Francfort, among the game where it is a question of consolidation of the sector of equipment.
In 2003, the Deta-Bank could assemble the country of Rhenania Palatinat and Halbab.
Nothing has been resurrected from this territory bucket.
Increasingly, the plans had been made public that the Government of Hesse pronounced against all the participation of Hellaba in these.
Afterward, the two other houses weren't far away.
The country of Rhenania Palatinat was attached to the Bade-Wuttenberg Bank in Stuttgart.
But there were still new treatments on the Deka-Bank regroupment with countries banks.
In the last place, G√ºnther Merl, President of the Director-General of Hellaba, was, however, pronounced against all trade strategy of fusion with its bank.
Independently, the feeling seems to be reflected that the regrouping of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now when the election to the Parliament of Bavi√®re country has passed, a BayernLB unit with the Bade-Wuttenberg Bank could be concreted first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly a good news.
If the pressure that is obtained to new fums should increase, the eventually partners have a little bit away.
In the South, she would then be a junior partner, although she had a better relationship with the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of Hesse-Turinge boxes and viruses, which have 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, has reached a lock at the beginning of the year on the entire unit with WestLB.
It would stay at the NorthLB river.
However, such geo-strategic reflects only one of the facets.
Another facet is the question of how the various trade models of each of these banks can be assumed.
In June, Merl declared that the decision-making issue, in the way the future capacity of the banks of the countries should be ensure, had not been resolved by the German group of training and viring boxes.
In terms, a WestLb's defense could have been located, a disappointment that is of course not desired.
It is also what it is questioned in the letter of the Directional Committee: in any case, it would be considered a global solution for the establishment.
In what way all this will be placed in the same panier with the unit of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to see.
The second weekend of the bird's party is known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena takes her as a little friend, and so there is nothing like that, he said.
Following them, nearly five litres of beer of the Caiser Mark, there is a built barbu that shows about 200 visitors of the bird's party, which their depths can produce.
Elena's first tape of Luca, then he's broken.
From Bolone, they came to Veron.
From there, from the road garden near the new Guy Puortta, four buss take the department tonight at 23:45, 'Monaco destination, birra' party, arrived at 6:30.
Three bus are stored before for the Italians, in one of the driving buss exclusively.
In a parking coast, the South Americas sing gold and already near their track, they have already fed last night.
And also bruy, explain Marco Guard, it's not for the Italians.
The buss are in Marco, which takes a long duplicate steel of failure and monsters to large silvered montures.
Since five years, they're going to the bird's party, three viruses have been done nothing but this year.
They're going evening, staying the day at the feast, and went back at 22:30.
And over the night, it would have implied unusing prices, explain Marco.
The travel costs 75 euros, including the weight of welcome with a Caiser beer, brassed in accordance with the Bavaroise cleaning law, the disease insurance and the responsibility of the group speaking German - Marco made a language course in Francfort.
And now buss running in the night on the "Brennero" direction.
There's no drink yet.
Quickly, it's gonna be quiet in the bus, the travellers sleep.
It's better, they'll still need their forces.
Pause will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buss with Italian immatriculations placed again a little break before Munich, on the author 8th.
In the morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six hours thirty as proposed on the parking near the Teresa place, about 50 other buses of all Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathered together, Marco has a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First: it is covered from the small yellow casquet.
Both is written on the left 'Fest of the Beer', in gothic, and next to the Internet address of Marco traveling.it'.
Secondly, the doors of the beer's head opened, they're short, and they cried to Marco at the morning.
'Cause, run and keep the places on the ground of the tabernacle.'
"Pass before, if it be locked, and not all yellow boxes on the same banks, it must be divided into the room."
The coffee, cried Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the advice!
Show the security agents that we do well!
When you leave your places, they are party!"
Thirdly: 'This evening, be returned here for ten hours and half-hour!'
And that's it. It's gone to the bird's party.
On the path, somebody is new of yellow boxes on the trees to find the way, the panels, and even to an electoral display of a large popular bavarois part.
We're ready to be ready to return.
It's the second weekend of the fish party, known as the week-end of the Italians.
There is no specific numbers; they are talking about 50 000 who walk through the Alpes and flow in the beer, 10% of the visitors would come out of Italy this weekend.
The municipal policy is strengthened by seven police in the South Tyrol, by Italian volunteers who support the red bavarois cross which makes a statistic on countries where Italians are the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Autrix (how 80) with about 200 medical interventions.
The one who is particularly appreciated of the Italians is the tente of the Hofbreu braseri.
Insufficiency nights for Hypo Real State Actioners
The German banking system is relatively stabil, encouraged the federal Minister of Finances only a few weeks ago.
That's the chance that the policy uses the word 'relatively' and that it would not be disappeared by the German banking sector by the crisis movements.
This is actually happening this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarois Hypo Real State (HRE), near the DAX, has a consortium of German banks, a billion credit to protect market turbulences.
One person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid credits were released to a total of 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real State should then pay interests on the fraction to which it would be right.
The money provides a lot of private banks and public law banks.
In the background, this is the Depfa society who supports losses.
The state finance was, according to a journal article, re-financing very shortly for long-term projects for which he had built money - which is not more possible since the failure on markets.
In the first September 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve was reduced from 95% to 2,37 million euros, and the own capital rate was also easily low to 1,6 to 1,45 per cent.
The current benefits and nets of financial transactions were, in the same period of the previous year, falling at zero, benefits from the attribution of credits and mobile values determined and the reduction of provisions in credit operations were cutting over 70% to 5 million euros.
And it is only due to the important benefits taken from the rebuilding of accountability costs from the restructuring of the old Depfa Group, and the rebuilding of interests in accordance with the book of fiscal procedures and commercial acquisitions for Conzern companies that the deficit of at least 16 per cent had been moded.
After his privacy in 1990, the financial state's old state had first a bad point on immobilier industrial credits, which later had been filalised in the Aareal bank.
Since the Classic State financing was not sufficient, Depfa was then more intensified in infrastructure projects and in the financing of common projects between private and State investors (Privat-Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the society, the Hypo Real State must proceed for amortisations that should have on the calculation of the profits and losses of the group a essential material effect that remains even a lot of flow.
The fact is that the divisions have been amputated.
Dej√† for 2007, they were cut off at two thirds.
The Real State Hypo is, since the Depfa's race, a state investment and infrastructure investment.
It is stronger than other dependent institutions on the refund on the interbank market since there is no client deposit.
With the failure of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the attribution of credits between banks was renewablely rate, the banks who accused their liquidity.
The Real State Hypo needs annually for a party - about 50 billion euros - of the total of the Depfa credits of a short-term refund.
According to a Communication of the Hypo Real State, the need for financing of the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the protection of the impact of international financial markets outside the current market.
Other sources say that the refund would be ensuring by funds until the end of 2009.
The President of the Director Committee of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real State group should no longer be taken to the financial markets in the middle term.
The Federal Bank and Federal Stablishment for Financial Services (Bafin) describes the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now ensure.
Actioners and creditors of the bank have no longer hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamic and improperability of the crisis, there is no doubt.
It is also not increasing that it doesn't make the financing in all its extensions.
But the contrary can't be disappeared.
After the fact that the bank is, after the last communicated, even at the Sunday insolvency doors at the end of the evening, this safeguard for at least providing will not succeed to save the spirits that are not more.
The course of the action has increased 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
The courses of obligations are particularly good.
While the dawns to the first chief have been deeply moved, the courses of the second plan are flexible.
The most touched is especially the investment funds of ancient W√ºrttemberg Hypo and those who have a long time for 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real State Bank seemed to be an alternative specification, then their value should be considered as dependent on the stability of the international bank system after the net duration of the bank crisis and the crisis of the institution who has made the crisis into the establishment of the Depfa Bank.
While the emission institutions, governments and less touched trade banks are still ready to support the system, we can preserve a resorption of disasters in time.
Or it will happen what nobody hopes at this time - that financial crisis can be overwhelmed in the next 15 months.
But in view of the renewed branches of a party nationalization, the probability that approached security has become a simple hope based today.
This should be maintained by nights of insomnia before all of the long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have taken a treatment to constitute a report of losses for the next year on the next income on the income of the boursian gains automatically preliminary.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to be presented on the first day at the Highschool of Tachibana, girls begin with ridiculous poffers: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to Mangas - in her new scenario log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Leave the way to go to school, I was afraid.
I live in the Tokyo device in Kawasaki direction and take the train 40 minutes to the Highschool of Tachibana.
I have to find the way alone, happyly I'm not lost.
The beginning of course does not seem to be fixed as strict as we are in Basse-Saxe.
Students appear each other after eight hours, until at nine hours less than twenty hours, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course begins, it was for me to present me.
I'm not of all kinds of love to speak before people, especially before a class of 40 students.
As I wasn't yet the uniform of school, I put a old egg of my mother's home, and a chemise, blue cups and black cups.
So in this tent, I was presented before the puppet, and I tried to say correctly, "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm called Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is a week.
At that time, I was very happy to learn the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have all made basses, smile and made signs, and I always heard the word "Kawaii".
I've already known him by my bags.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the overliving of Japanese additives and means "mignon, cho".
Then I've been smoothed in my place.
The girl near me made me a great ironic smile, she found that it was a honor that the double correspondant was sitting near her.
The rest of the time was too calm, but when the egg was dreamed, I was in the rules.
Everyone talked to whoever better, could be ridiculous, and put me a lot of questions - in this case, it's too difficult to understand Japanese.
During the break, they all went out of their Bento.
My home mother also made me this type of Lunchbox -- it's really other than the miserable in Germany.
I had a rice of aromatic herbs, small sauces, a cooking salt and algebra, fruits and a kind of flesh around Tofu.
Most of the time, I don't have any idea of what I eat exactly here in Japan.
The things have a strange appearance and a completely new google.
That's sure it's that everything is really good.
Well, maybe the pure salts, brorrr!
Bentos are not only dinners in Japan's schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a Bento who has prepared herself, and then he is prepared particularly carefully - in the hope that you can make a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read this in my bags.
I'm curious to know if I could also watch it here.
"Why is Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go a year to Tokyo school.
Then I always answered:
"Perce that's what I'm doing."
At the end, reading balls, it's what I'm prefering for years.
And in order to understand the manages and cultures that are there, at a moment, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there a day.
Because I've also got a low for traditions, us and costumes.
And here we give them a lot of importance.
On the other hand, Japan is the country of technologies and the most recent tendencies - on the other hand, it is serious, disciple and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never feel lost here, even if Tokyo is the greatest city I never saw."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a chaffard was before the danger, does that mean that he feels too scared?
The neurophysist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals have also feelings.
But how can we check that he tests the same thing when he acts like us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions are published for several years by scientific celebrations.
The SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of answers to the question "What do you think you're true without power to have evidence?"
I think the animals have feelings and other conscious states without me or any other one could prove it even as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
While we turn to other species and that we focus on the issues of the resident or general of the conscience, we will be penetrationally practical in lands because Hardware does not correspond.
When a rat is before a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, he was or attack.
Human beings are in the same way, therefore some scientists decline a comparable subjective life.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain makes the transposition of our subjective life to the difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that circles associated almost always with human conscience include the prefrontal Cortex (with its participation in the short-term memory and direction and execution functions).
This large region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be absolutely absent in other beasts.
Therefore, at least for these aspects of our conscience that depends on the prefrontal Cortex, including the consciousness of whom we are, and the ability to prevent and decide, it is reasonable to imagine that human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant personality could reside in the language nature of the Human: a large part of its existence is linked to language, that means often that its conscience depends on.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even though the conscience should not depend on the language, it would be sure that the animal conscience, which is the way it is produced, would probably have been different from most of our conscience states.
That's why it's too difficult to determine what the consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not leave or measure or, on the fact of this particular Hardware, analyze on our own experience, then his observation has great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the contents of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of the conscience that should be easily accessible scientificly.
We may examine the conscious processes of animals without holding account of their content, and it is exactly what happened when studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that followed Christoph Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous corrections of the conscience than on caused mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also subscribes the rate of the Court's prefrontal in the achievement of visualization.
But what does it happen to emotions then?
I conclude that an emotional system like the fear is active in a brain of knowledge of its own activities.
This is therefore the mental state in which we find when the activities of the local defence system in the brain (or follows, such as the reactions of the body) comes from the living memory.
Thus, emotions are extremely linked to the cortex regions that characterize primates and particularly the Human.
The subtitles of the resident, associated with our volunteer nature, are disappointed, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, difference and category of states for others than to us.
In the opposite, for example, Antonio Damasio thinks that the feelings of primitive activities are born in the regions of Cortex‚Äôs body feelings and the brain throne, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which still focuses on the clerbral throne.
As this network has not been very changed during human evolution, it could actually share transversal feelings in all kinds.
In a pure theory point, I can't resist it, but I think it's invisible.
Pankseep says that what is like fear of men and rates is likely like that in the two cases: how can we continue to check whether rates and humans feel the same thing when they act likely?
A cafard was before the danger, but if he feels scared?
In my eyes, similar behaviors are not enough to prove similar vectors.
Certainly, nervous comparison helps: rates and men have similar brains, cafards by contrast do not have even a brain.
But is the cerebral throne in the origin of the feelings?
And even if we could prove this for the Human: how could we show it in the rates?
I think rates and other mammifers, maybe even cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to show him.
And because their feelings are actually totally different from our own (as human conscience reacts on specific circuits and on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In all cases, progress raises the nervous plan in the measure where it is the same thing in the races and in the humans.
As I don't explore language and conscience in rates, nor feelings, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as a short term, but I prefer to prevent progress instead of cutting me constantly against a wall.
I'm really a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the EUFA: a period of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
The First Assembly Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would be immediately placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its capacity to organize, in cooperation with Poland, the campaigns of Europe," said Wasjunik.
"But it's not an amnisy for our country.
The work is just starting, and there is still much to do in the two countries."
In the Calendar of Building or Destruction of towns, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the period.
The number of towns for the campaign of Europe may eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukraine Ligue Grigoria Surkis.
"EUFA has always been on our eye."
Another racial measure was decided in Poland.
The direction of the PZPN Poland football library was suspended by the National Olympique Committee after several scannes and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Commission was reviewed on the request of the Ministry of Miroslaw Drewicki Sports.
There would be a real danger that the PZPN could not be able to act in rules," says Drzewiecki of the PAP PAP.
"We have secured in a mail to the President of the EUFA that the preparations of the European Chamber 2012 would not suffer."
Many members of the First Division have already been condemned in the previous saison, condemned for the manipulation of obligatory relevance; at the end, the beginning of the Ligue has been declared at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indicted against attack
She wanted to promote for a new film, talking about her private life in an interview - and now he has hungers with her ex: the Hollywoodian star Meg Ryan raised the ball on her ex adultery Dennis Quaid.
He's excusing - and against attack.
A late Rose war for the old couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywoodian actors are in a disgraced battle - to see and on everybody.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American InStyle Journal on the causes of marriage missing: "Dennis was long infidel, and it was very painful."
She would have taken knowledge of the extension of the trompery only after the divorce.
The motive of this striptease of the thinking is resident in the press relations of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - there is reported the story of adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his infidel marine quality fell clearly: it would be "Monstrueux", says this to "New York Daily News", 54 years, "Meg has reached the story of our relationship and manipulation."
It would be more "regretable", that "the pain and the disagreements that make a divorce for each child will be relied in public" for their common son of 16 years of Jack."
While Ryan lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has gone out and soon becomes the father of jumeous.
So his response was at the attack: "In any case, my life continues.
I love happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the best."
The prices of airballs and hotels are broken
In the first half of 2008, the air and the nights of hotels were less lovers than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, the vols would even be reduced to 50%.
The flights and the nights of the hotel would be pregnant - it is the result of a study of the financial service provider and traveling American Express.
The company analysed its data of reservations from the first semester of 2008 and established, after a price exhaust in the first trimester, a clear low of the benefits in the second trimester.
After the hotel market prices increased for years, the hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, the prices increased in 41 of 48 European cities considered more than 6,9 per cent in average compared with 2007 in 48 European cities.
Since April to June, the prices were already 3,6% lower than the previous year.
The trend was clean in Paris and Rome, where the travellers had to be paid from 30 to 37 percent less than one year ago.
The causes of all of this would be resident for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "free traveling in low American tourists".
Financial places such as Francfort or London would be more touched by the review of hotel prices as the industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In Sweden City, the hotel prices have a 26.3 per cent higher, the record in Europe.
Thus, on the price of the flows, the tendance was at the top in the first trimester:
In view of the increase of the price of the demand, economic travellers have paid in average 7,1 per cent more than in 2007, the long-currer flows, very carburant consumers, have even increased to 29,2 per cent.
Since April to June, the prices of economic claims have been broken in average of 12,5 per cent in comparison with the previous trimester, in case class and in first class, the price variations were largely less pronunciated.
In Germany, the prices have recognised more importantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, the prices increased 11.9 per cent in the second trimester, they cut 23.6 per cent.
The German internal vols were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price scale would be a flexible economic growth, explaining the firm.
The request would be deleted from the land in a lot of segment of the airport market.
On the other hand, there would be an accent pressure of the competition of the "open" Treaty that liberalizas the air circulation between the United States and Europe.
The meaning of the tendue situation is the elimination of air companies of non-rentable traits, and the high number of aircraft companies that would have placed the balance during the first semester 2008 - they were 24 companies nothing but in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes first of the classation.
In Borussia, Luhukay hasn't always been successful to find an eleven official.
Christoffer Klein. Increasing. Atterrissage in catastrophe for international player Marko Marin.
The player of Gladbach is just in the late in the game and his top shoot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was exactly formulated, he was out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew that he was right.
"We need this second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the armory of the armory rooms in Hamburg.
It wasn't a big thing in the clothes, half time was finished and most of them were raised.
Rieger was about three decades of HSV physiotherapeut, playing a great reputation as well of ancient protagonists.
That is why his request was received to strategic places.
The intrainer attorney Cornelius Jol was busy and lifted up the pocket to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the trainer in the head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar, and that it goes out with this second goal!
The practice has missed.
"It was not very beautiful to see today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "sohate also be stopped."
This 1:0 (1:0 at the mid-time), the Hamburg team has to shoot him on a shoot of the successful head by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very low players of Gladbach could not do bad games in Hamburg.
"It was a sale of victory," says Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate this morning 121 years.
After week after midnight, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the Arena and the provisional classification tables on the gender screen that indicated their club as first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without real party.
"We know to take the reculation," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediary result of the table reflects more the implicit character of the first Ligue than the domination of its HSV.
The team with his arrivals lately attached - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the guard of Petric's purpose as Jansen down from the FC Bayern - forms some suddenly, but she doesn't still be brilliant.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," asked Jol.

In the dark matter the air of spatial skins
Since years, a mysterious phenomena leaves researchers in perplexity: the dark material influences the speed of space sounds during the name of gravitational support.
Experts fear that the general theory of relationship is not completely correct.
From nearly 18 years, the Space Song "Ulysses" flys in the space.
From the fact that carburant conducts soon glucose, cryog√®ne death is the threat.
Since years, a mysterious phenomena is caused to disarrow among researchers - the anomalia of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manufacturer of spatial sounds, which they receive additional elean in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So, the sonds can economise a lot of carburant.
The American research sonde Casini-Huygens used this physical assistance, as well as the Sunday Sunday Ulysses.
This is what amazing the researchers of others since years: flying objects do not always belong to 100% of the way they are waiting for it in accordance with the future laws of gravitation.
Furthermore, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
The sounds become unexpected as faster or faster.
Before now, physicians couldn't explain this effect.
They baptized him with the gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relationship of Albert Einstein, which describes the strength of attraction of the matter of the space court, could not be completely correct.
The American physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always believes hard to do that Einstein does not threaten and try to explain the gravitational support with the name of the black matter that the astronomes identified in the universe.
"The black material may be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," wrote.
The researchers of the space know the existence of the black matter only for about 10 years.
It appears that it is an attraction force which the effect is observable on other heavenly bodys.
In contrast, it is completely invisible, that it does not send or reflect any electrical radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the black matter would represent the same as a fine fifth of the whole universe mass.
Tourists taken in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their visitors, the tourists in Egypt should be released and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
The Sudanian reviewers had required a ransom of millions of euros.
During the fusilation before the liberation, six taxers would be killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were removed.
The negotiations for the race would be already engaged.
Germans are without stop in the kidnappers collector.
WELT ONLINE spends the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are visiblely free.
This is what they have communicated to concert the television of Egypt, the Arab TV chain of Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV chain Sky TG 24: "Our concilians and other offences have been released.
We're trying to check their health state," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian partners are well and are safe, announced the National Television of Egypt.
The 19 participants of the excursion in the wilderness should be already on the road to the Cair.
The circumstances around a fusilation before the release of otages remain flexible: thus, the kidnappers would have been near to attach a term to the exhaustion, according to the directions of an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanian army kills six kidnappers without crying.
"The problem was resolved.
They were agreed with a ran√ßon," said the agent.
It was not more than to collect the otages," when it was sudden, "this surprise" was produced.
Sudanian soldiers had attacked this Sunday six reviewers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and they had stopped two of them.
The tax collectors had required Germany a rate of six million euros; the money should be delivered by the German woman of one of the otages.
The day "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to the words of a German mediterranean, the liberation of the otages was late because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the article, the reviewers wanted to release women's otages after the payment of the race.
The men should be held until the reviewers found a safe way to escape.
The German campaign in Caire refused to make any comment on this report.
"Abus of a beautiful father" who carried himself."
A court was informed that years of abuses infected by her beauty have sent a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57ans of Stithians, in the Cornouailles, was prisoned for six years after having adopted eight officers of accusation for independent facts.
The Court of Great Instinct of Truro reported that he regularly lied his beauty, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34-year-old, was murdered home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
Infant when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached her and banded her before she forced sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 80s, and he returned to live in the Cornuailles.
His beauty-fit goes to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a favorable national Trust assissment, was a host of abuses that had been infected for him twice a week.
Mrs Randle, who was a good surface and cyclist, was seen since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "he had lost all hope in life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she's murdered by suffering a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle faced the beauty father of her daughter who was else, confirmed a letter of confession that ended so: "I'm attacked and the bands regularly."
"I didn't hurt her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
The judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a phethistist, your victim should certainly be terroristed, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This delaying saga has been completed by the suicide of the victim.
And the more amazing is the fact that if she hadn't committed this gest, her story would never be finished in the court."
He added: "I am particularly underlined, as his father and his mother described, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"In these things, she would certainly be a young, happy, promised, and successful."
Condemnation for the loss of official data.
The Ministerial Office of the Cabinet, which had forgotten secret documents on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, under the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moved when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train in direction of Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the BBC's hands before they were delivered to the police.
This is the less serious condemnation of this act, without any insignement of criminal intention.
The correspondent of the BBC, Frank Gardner stated that this episode had many of the Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office" he said.
The salary that cannot be named is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the Act, it is the clause that treats information safeguard.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministry Office was placed under the Conservation of the Metropolitan Police, see the very sensitive nature of its work linked to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained appreciations on Al-Qaeda and on the resources of security forces in Iraq.
It was informed of the decision, Monday, and then was transported from his home to a secret place.
Building society against the B&B factory.
The British companys of the building could pay more than 80 million ¬£ to cover the safeguarding of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government offered 14 billion ¬£ to protect the deposits of 2.6 million from Bradford & Bingleys.
The interests of this price will be paid by all companies who collect the money of the equipment, including 59 building companys.
The General Director of Building Society Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that it was "increasing" to know that society and their members should pay the cashed powers...
The price of $14 billion will be rewarded when Bradford & Bingleys hypothecs will be disappointed.
But the interests that will in the same time increase will be debited each year to 700 financial companies collecting the deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC, that 59 building companys are included in this list.
It's amazing to see that the institutions who have had a careful conduct... must now pay some of the institutions that were very careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company should pay a proportional sum to the deposits that it deposits, and that the intermediary society should pay about 18% of the cost.
The Tresor estimates that the interests of the price will be exalted in 2009 to $450 million.
This means that society should find 81 million ¬£ to regulate the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of the Budget Companies, stated to the BBC that this decision seemed injustice to him.
It's unrighteous to see that institutions who have been aware of the review of the immobilier market must now pay for institutions much less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first year.
"We must examine all the aspects of this matter during the next weeks, to assess the options to be taken to avoid that the construction companys and their members pay this sale facture," said Mr. Cole.
The interests for 2009 covered seven months, from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be necessary to pay the interests of the whole year, which could be doubled.
Since the construction companys are non-actional organizations, their members finish the facture or by higher charges, or by lower interests for equipment accounts.
The lake increases to five penny in letter
Jersey's people have to pay more for their lake
Jersey Daily announced that she was going to increase the price of her late, five penny to letter, from lunch.

. Before the increase of February, the large price of Jersey's late was changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm of Bangladesh has seen the warning
A Court in Bangladesh rejected an advisory request to the ex-PM Sheikh Hasina, which risks to be stopped when he returned to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to confer his attention because of his examination to have extorted a person of business, 50 million of Taka ($729,000,00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations that are addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the rival of Sheikh Hasina, has been relaxed forward this month ago.
Sheikh Hasina should be returned to Bangladesh for a few weeks, but his party, League Awani, requested that the proceeding military government of the country would first give him his freedom.
The correspondants have submitted that the terms of his liberation are contradictional because if you allow him to leave the country for medical reasons, they don't see why she could not stay free to return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers have announced that she will now call the Supreme Court against the Order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request, saying that she has not needed a warning that she had been authorized to go to the foreign for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present a call against the Order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she had needed this caution to return to the country to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should go back after October 17, he told an elder leader of the Awami Party.
She was arrested last year after the internal military government had subjected the power, but it was released in June to care foreign.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, not the accusations they do.
Inquisitions for the African Antipolio campaign.

BSkyB loss the ITV judiciary battle
BSkyB has lost its procedure after the Concurrency Commission, which would have to reduce its participation in its ITV rival transmittor.
The Court of Concurrency commanded BSkyB to reduce its ITV parts of 17.9% at least 7,5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had stopped competition and had allowed him to influence injustly ITV.
BSkyB purchased its parts in 2006 after a agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB, ITV parts, had seen the doubt on the effective independence of ITV, incentived by the Concurrency Commission to investigate
The boss of Virgin, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the offcom regulator was all contrary to this accusation.
BSkyB repeated that the force to reduce its ITV parts would not be reasonable and, in contrast, it was excessive ‚Äì especially seeing BSkyB was renewing to its vote rights.
New research in the affairs of American prosecutors.
The Agency General of America called a special accuser to check the question of the licence of nine American procureurs in 2006.
Everything is born from the office of the general inspector of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the Blanche House, lawslaters and the ex-general Procureur Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the threat of lawyers who support their licence is for political reasons.
The Special Auditor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate if the officers in the investigation were lying to the investigators, thus obtaining justice.
"By serious offences of potentially criminal conduct, unbased, have not been completely confirmed or resolved," said the Inspector General, Glenn Fine, in his report.
The nomination of a special accuser can force witnesses to deposit was one of its greatest recommendations.
The discussion begins by radiation in December 2006 of nine American procureurs made by the United States Justice Department.
At the time, the department had stated that the procureurs were licensed by means of medium prestations.
But then he would urge that the licensed procureurs would not be criticized more than their other colleagues, which encourages some observators to appreciate a political notification to these licences.
Some of the procureurs were accused to be near the Republics of the Congress, while others would refuse to investigate fraud votes against the Democrates.
American procureurs investigate and continue judicial instances for government.
It is certain that they can be licenced at any time, but they can not be for political reasons.
The Leader of the Department of Justice, Director General Alberto Gonzales, finally accused to be implied in this licensing case, and finally demissioned.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice have also given their demission.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical in the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, saying that he considered "the first responsibility" of these licences, and finally "abdicate" his role of leader," which has not been not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the old Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, have been criticised to have not succeeded to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epope should be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored to Q Awards for her epique song Bat Out of Hell.
The song, who will receive a oscar during the ceremony in London, next week, has stated to be "honored" to get this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf album of 1977.
The evening of the price delivery is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a restricted selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, director of Q magazine editor, said: "There are songs that transceive things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly party
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a lot of voice like the Meat Loaf.
She starts with a instrumental section that is at least two minutes.
The song was made in commerce in the United Kingdom, as one in 1979, classified at the fifth place.
Furthermore, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English classs, and was sold over 40 million exemplaries in the whole world.

A Small Rue in the village, often forgotten, and Perhaps It is almost in Vente.
New York has hundreds of events, bullevards, streets and other parallel routes, some celebrations, only other functionalities.
. And even some veterinary taxes, and local residents of long date, do not know indications to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard talking about it.
The street is located in the East Village and parcourt the north of First Street - to not confond with the Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At about 30 feet of wide for 120 long, it seems like a puzzle along instead of an active art.
There are no panels in the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirators.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent builders on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more fluid travel to the magazines and boots, which should be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirators including long-term neighbors, were stated to be charmed by these shortcuts just because it remains one of the last and most oldest rues of the housepath.
But the Preservation Department and the Immobilial Development of the town that leads the street, there is no interest to keep it.
This month, during a meeting of neighborhood Committees, town representatives and Avalon Bay have established a proposal that allows the immobilier building to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No.3.
"It's just a little space apart from the city, and we would want the city to keep extra Place" she said.
"They could propose to put him back in state and control him, whatever Avalon could do, but we want to keep him public."
Avalon Bay announces several months ago that she wanted to repeat the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee where the building would allow space.
The proposal of this potential acquisition was published at the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, the door of Avalon Bay's words, said that, although the company wants to explore the street, it does not mean strongly that she wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to roll this department, and the public deal," she said, "with underlined that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a door of the Immobiliar Preservation, confirmed that the city would like to sell the street, and also underlined that the mission of the Agency was to develop the property instead of controlling it.
Compared with her most colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a lot of history.
Some believe that Extra Place brings this name since 1802, when the heritage of the great ferment of many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, laid down this small earthquake, which remains from abandoned.
The CBGB's postery entry, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place; the street is sure greater through the photo covering of Ramones' Rocket to Russia's album
"the place was beautiful" said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was full of ferry, hair, barricans, posters, tables and branches."
Some residents, including the bloggers who had already spoken about the evolution to the East Village's luxury, were opposed to the idea of sell Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should be public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rare - a virtually similar fragment of the city that should be fished in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducted a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestions: A Nostalgic Army Review on A City in the Extinction Process") refers to the history of the city and Extra Place, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, writes: "Extra Place is a small cut-sack, a dark day as a night, and delimity by the doors of a rolled rolled and persians, full of journals of the past week that run the long of the guests."
In a few exceptions nearby, the street has always the same way.
A short rate acting at the ground of the road, near a gate that led to the CBGB, and now it becomes the seat of a chick clothing magazine.
Graphics on the walls, a 22-year-old beer bottle, reposes to a bill of journals that just come to be thrown.
Some pasts have stated that they only think rarely at Extra Place, and suggested that it was valued.
Mr. Field, of his cost, stated that some were under consideration of the street attractive in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "the dark, humble and degrading places are broken in dark places."
The Bilinga Debat: Immersion in English
In this part of the Supervision Programme of Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discusses the position of candidates on Big Education.
Lance T. Izumi, ancient member of studies in California, and an old director of the education department in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-actor of the book "not well as you don't think it. Why the media classs must choose their school."
Attracting Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
The campaign of Mr. Obama suggests that "Afro American students and Latin have less chance to diplome than the white students." It is a real fact.
In order to fight these differences, Mr Obama's education programme supports particularly among other subjects, "Bingue transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question to Obama is to know whether it wants to realize a bianual education that defends the education in other languages than the English, it will also be interested in eliminating the differences.
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school of the east content of Los Angeles.
Students of this school are in large Spanish majority and low income.
More than one third of the students, constituted of many news arrived, studying English.
A number of students in CM1, 100% have passed the 2008 Math State exam, expert level.
In the same way, almost 93% of the students have passed in English-d'arts
This incredible success has been achieved by another ingr√©dient that Mr. Obama has progressed.
Sixth Street set on analysis, practice, a constant evaluation of capacity and an exemplary attitude.
Moreover, and here is a example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, main of the Sexth Street, this school has established the instruction of English" full warmness".
The total emersion in English focuses on nearly constant use of English instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, in contrast to the bicycle education, said, "We had a great success with a student who came to come from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were leaving without his class, you would have no chance to identify it."
"It's going, she's watching, "It's gone for us."
Mr. Obama should not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and reply it in other schools composed in most of the Spanish students learning English.
The great results received by this school are talking about themselves, but the education policies inside its party (the National Education Associations support the Big Education) and its great support for the Big Education, understood the response of Mr Obama's response.
Although the immigrants are favorable to learn English, Mr Obama recently considered this question as an insignificant, when he states that we all must stop political on the literature of English laws.
"In fact, he said, "You must ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to remove the differences, he should then be considered with attention, education models that work, instead of dealing or considering them insignificants.
Petrole Nets See the New Neighbors of the World of Economy
The prices of the petrol have been very lunch, because people fear that the saving plan for financial markets can not succeed to live in the economy.
In the end of the brute steel operations, 7 per cent came to 99.80$ baril. The Mercantile Bourse of New York, in the ventures of this morning.
The prices have broken over 20 dollars in the baril since the last month.
These two last weeks, the first material markets have been visited by Wall Street Financial Attachment and by two powerful Ouragans in the Mexican Golf.
After known in July, an increased 145.29$ in the bar, the prices were cut down to nearly 90 dollars in the bar in this month before rebounding the depths of financial markets.
This morning, the investors are again worried, although the Agreement on the Safety Plan, the largest of the history, concluded this week by the leaders of the Congress.
The news was held by recent concerns in which the crisis would be sustainable.
In the last episode of this financial catastrophe," Citygroup will build the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, stated the Government this morning.
At the same time, Belgian, Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalised the European Financial Conglomerate, Fortis.
The Barclays Capital Analysts stated that the franetic negotiations of this week end, concluded with the Safety Agreement" seems not to have successful to revive the market."
While economic situation is deteriorated, the application in the first, including petrole, should be relaxed.
"The prospective of global equity, interest and change of markets has become incertain" wrote the Deutsche Bank analysis in a letter to their investors."

"In respect of the first materials, our most pressing suspect is the one to understand until the American virus would be globally and in particular in China."
The bank analysiss have reduced their achievements for the next year, seeing the consumption of fishery two in the rating of economic growth, were therefore obligated to decrease 20 per cent, the previsions of the pet and gas prices for 2009.
The Feed of the Second Time Determinant for the improvement of the Team Record.
After past these eight last inches, more time than anyone in uniform of Jets Shaun Ellis, the defensor thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when Jets transformed a 0 to 0 in a explosion.
"I've never seen anything about this kind," said Ellis.
The second time started after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona were well played under cloud darkness.
Following the quarter back Brett Favre successfully made a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, he signs a precurseur from a afternoon while their relationship has made a bond forward.
Favre found Coles for more two other touchdowns, the first when a corner fell back and the second, at 10 seconds of half time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre stated about all his pass to Coles.
"It's a medium player."
"We communicate extremely well, though what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing at the catch, the defence struck the fourth back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shooter and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens left the ballon out of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ballon could be the most famous event
The Cardinals took the control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets reached the ballon, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 billion, taking a price of 34 to 0.
It was the best that Jets could mark in a while.
"The coach of Jets, Eric Mangini, who's asked to describe this fool, said, "The second time or the third?"
When the two Jets said to him, "I can tell you that I'm more appreciated for the second time than the third.
"A lot of points have been marked a little while."
Gerselassie relaxed, overscreen his world record.
Haile Geberselassie, Ethiopia, has proved to be worthy of his title of the best ground corner of the century, after shooting his own record of the world at Berlin Marathon of Sunday, so it became the first to run 26,2 miles at less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 of a comforting course on the board, Gerselassia struck 27 seconds of his record of 2:04:26, discussed the last year in Berlin.
In 35 years, Gerselassia brought the 26th record of the world of his carrier superbe during which he brought the world's campaign or the world record for any distance from 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gerselassia had missed the olympical marathon of Beijing, fearing - may be exaggerated today‚Äôs eyes, - that air pollution does not increase its asthm problems.
In contrast, he promised to run to Berlin.
In nearly perfect-time conditions, 48 degrees at the department, 55 at the arrival-Gurselassia wind yesterday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track courses such as Gerselassia and Paul Tergat, all the two kenians, converted to background courses, contributed to the reduction of the marathon record of more than two minutes in these last 10 years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won to Berlin at 2:06:05.
After the lunch victory, Gerselassia told the reporters, having suffered two weeks ago, and had missed training for a week.
It is obviously that the rest has allowed him to stay brilliant, but not rounded.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporters.
"It was perfect.
I've left it last week, and today, I've had doubts; but at the end, it's all gone for the best."
It was close to him in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - to have too orchestrated his courses, eviting the world stars of Marathon, in fact on libraries as if they were in a track competition, and considering more global records than the meaning of competition.
But this critical does not reduce the greatness of the capabilities of Gerselassia as a background curve.
Wednesday Gerselassie, previously by four Kenians, recorded a time from 1:02:04 to my way.
Two kenian elite corners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to decline Gerselassia after the file heads were lost.
At a few more than three miles of the arrival, Gerselassia made his final mount to depart from Kwambai, which ends second in 2:05:36, improved his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived the third at 2:07:48.
In the female course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakistan, now German citizen, has finished a remarkable year from the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe has the world record of 2:15:25.
The last printemps, Mikitenko, of 36 years old, surprised all of them to bring London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing games because of a bad hypothetic to do, but promised to win in Berlin, improved by her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She runs with a happy strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopians and Kenians to take a good benefit , and then the passengers are about 18 miles 1‚ÅÑ2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived the second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended the third at 2:25:01.
In a city in Part, Orgueil and the tests of the Black Vie
Hidden in the development of his great park, at a few thousands of the school, the brilliant and thegent Orlando, there is a small quiet town where the honour and complications of African experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to integrate, the house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is not so simple to do our days." The city on five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 feet feet, 300 good guests, full of guarantees, two schools and not prisoners."
She's now become a pearl town
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Zora Festival each year in Eatonville, to make the most beautiful writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city that she described has become tourist through its inclusion in the tourist guidance of the Florida edit by The Depression- was Federal Writers' Project remains a party place.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she wasn't already in the 30s, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often restricted to share its real thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he lost."
Even if it is the year of the election of a Black President, Senator Barack Obama, who also invited a dialogue open on the race theme, many here remain careful about the view of the stranger.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, resident since always and the oldest paroisian in the city.
"It has to be agreed with the reality.
Eatonville has been defined as a paradox of triomph and war.
It represents a historical model of a black power and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty level is two times the average national.
It is a central point but also a example of black rural culture - sometimes deadlined, sometimes cut off - that reminds the birth of the American slavery.
What would explain why residents are at times worthy and protectors.
The interest in the image of Eatonville with Zora, which everyone named here to Hurston.
She presented her birth city to the whole world through true books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the guidance of Florida transformed this city, located just at the outside of Route 17, a road through the center of Florida, often forgotten, which occurred in the chapter of black history and human drame.
Audacies such a big box in life as in literature, Hurston sent readers to the property magazine of the first Mair of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided in several private parties.
"passed the road on the left," she wrote, "and you will find the modern public school marron and white, with her gardens and these well maintained games, which Howard Miller always took care of, although he knows a lot of reading and write.
She also mentioned the new Viow Dash man and wrote that Lee Glenn's sale of drinks of all kinds and all that can be used to travel people.
So, at least one hundred words, Hurston associated with Eatonville to a government car, but also to analphabetisation, removal, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't so.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone loved.
Zora described the reality ", said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the young girls of Johnson's girls that Hurston has immortalized, quoting the no colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not appreciate."
We are always remembered from Hurston as a living and excentrical person, which often returned after his family was moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembered that Hurston was normally in the city without warning, at the front of a big Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and brought pantalons here, where even today, we are honored traditional habits.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told them, while many moved from her.
"They were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he adds more, balanced in his cup of the spectacular patient that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurton was certainly baptized, that' she never remained too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to be forgotten.
Although she was a star of the literature, a contemporary contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in Barnard College of the 20s, she was entered into a tomb anywhere, in Fort Pierce, Flace, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there is no great reminder, no plaque for the great public.
I don't think they have understood the contribution or heritage that she offered to the world ", said Valeria Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a manufacturer of Hurston in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials of Orange County wanted to pass a writer to five ways in the city to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, main route to two ways of the community.
Orlando's development has already put Interstate 4 to the west angle of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just from a difficult period of his history.
A strengthened integration, among other things, has finished the isolation relatively ideal of the community.
In the 50s, the discussion on the measure of races has brought hate to the doors of the community.
"To that time, a band of white young people came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the coast," said Mr. Franklin.
"A lady is even deceived."
They launched a passenger of their car."
In a letter from 1955 from The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston is sure the request of the Supreme Court for a forced integration, defined by its decision in Brown v. Board of Education' insufficient instead of honoring my race."
The residents now proclaimed that the elimination of the racial collection in schools, although positive in some aspects, deployed the cohesion of Eatonville and enhanced the confidence of young people.
"The Black Children had the habit of being embarrassed, I remembered it well - we had our master on the morning, and evening also," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ela Dinkins, and director in the head of the Saveguard of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This was long, she added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You wouldn't cut your white teacher because he's white-- I mean there's a line of cultural deterioration," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, otherwise, have allowed to create space for other Zora Neale Hurston writers, actors and artists who have gone out of the prejudice, such as she, army of a joyful trust and guidance lines such as: "How can they take care of my company's pleasure?"
That's over me."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker came on the anonymous grave of Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclamed biography on Hurston realized by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seler, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The draft of the Authority has arrived just on the moment when the most beautiful girl in Eatonville had found her attractions .
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston considered her as a savior.
The community began to organize a Houston festival to demonstrate the catastrophical consequences that would generate this author.
hundreds of fans have come to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January, to remember it.
After many years, the content replaced the proposal of the authority.
"The fault of the auteur to five paths, extremely quickly, a real citizen honour," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd summoned the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the author's project allowed him to change his own image.
Inhabitants, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer that frequency of our church since 1993 began to come in a lot of people, and the residents began to recognize the past.
Eatonville is classified historical city since 1998.
A mono theme library (renamed obviously Hurston) will work in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaired.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomalia for Florida: at six thousand of Orlando, she can be considered as a rent road in a day of steaval rain, small as it was when she was founded by 27 black families in 1880.
(the number of 90 per cent of black today)
Foreign people who are coming to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason to be, are still treated with proudness.
We need to ask the permission for most interviews, and some things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, pending by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a strong teacher and a weak teacher for the red red, are always afraid that their insulary community should not be well understood.
However, I saw the expansion of the Houston festival, a certain local orgeling level is emerged.
Youths, particularly, are trying to consider Eatonville as Hurston as his whole race: beautiful, problematic, and everything, not better or worse, but also glorious, creative, bossous, foolish and medium than the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true of the citizen love that we hear the voice of Mr. Franklin's snow, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who wanted to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, which need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11ans, winter Park jumes, seems to have learned correctly the description of Eatonville.
"The most people who pass in this area will think, "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others," Alondra Kenon said after the last weekend.
But if you stop and take the time to look at the story, it's a very beautiful city."
This is in New York, everybody talks shortly financially.
Although everything, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were remote from the kiosco and telescope managers in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eyes of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the offices in the offices in the offices in the offices in the board, bankers and managers of covering funds that monopolize New York, pass the worst "day in the office" from the crack of 1929.
The bookers continue to favour on throats, with their carriots and their muffins plates for the morning meetings.
Latinas are always training between resident buildings, such as mules, a fifty-fifty luxuous chemistry pendued to a game available on their grounds.
Officers continue to buy their sandwich morning to walking markets, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h in week.
I didn't feel the crisis unless the entirely pessimistic records until this afternoon, when I decided to open a new training account.
It was happy that I was planned to work at the next day, because I would find my local JP Morgan Chase, a twenty-five people who make the cow.
Not before the guides of the chassiers, nor to remove the species or to make a verse, but before the client guichet, where normal customers ordered their chequeries, tourists asked the direction for the Macy magazine, and new clients would work accounts.
Most of those before me, I would learn later from Starr, my "personal banks authorised," made all the cow for the same reason as I.
Not in the same way, because they had already removed their economics from the smaller banks, such as the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have removed their money from the accounts of treatment named thrifts (as a company of building), credit associations, and the type of local equipment boxes and their branches that work only in a state, and they say to treat customers as their family.
In the past, 15 of these banks were failed.
The last days, Washington Mutual, a bank at the capital of 327$ reached the failure syndicat, and when the New Yorkians went home for the week end of this week, another bank, Wachovia, at the accounts of a 440 million dollars, looked forwardly for a purchaser to save it.
The office and the employees of offices who are before me, explored from another potential debuilding, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to be trusted, or the one who makes the most safeguard in Wall Street.
Some of the New Yorkians have become very familiar in the world of the financial these weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local chinese supermarket, talking to the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that has been hungry, and of his master director Dick Fuld, with the same family she could have to criticize a college.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform form of my building, has changed our normal conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and fruit market.
She said to me, after my visit to the bank, "I put all my economy in the market of monetary funds.
"I have changed, I don't want to take risk."
Musulman tombs profaned while the Austria is the oxygen to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right air from the Austrian Freedom Party Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to present the organization of the "Cuits against Islamisation" in Antwerp, July 17 January 2008.
They bring road panels that illustrate blue-round muscles.
The Police accuses the extremists of the right extremists to profan a Australian muslim cimeter, the week end of the victory of the extreme policy parts of the Right to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tombs were seriously immortal in Traun's cimeter, near Linz, between Friday and this morning; it is according to the police, an organizated action.
The delinchants have spent on several tombs, Jews symbols such as David's star; but detectives think that it could be done to devour the feeling of extremists against muslims immigrants.
This accident may be in some kind of connected to the elections.
A door of the islamic local community has stated to be "deeply shot" to the announcement of this profanation, which is just happening during the religious month of Ramadan that touches his end.
The Austria thinks seriously to find its strength, after its occision to the right in parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two right extreme parties that have at least 30 percent of votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have sent an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were also considered, according to the critics, such as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chief of Freedom Party who won more than 18% of votes, sent his campaign against the port of the fould and Burkas, and even expressed his opposition against the alha food.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brothership" to abuse the Mount of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of muscles and minerals, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Australia and Europe's islamism.
The sondages and analysis done just after elections, have defined the right extreme as the most strongest political block of the country, which is shown by most young voters that have done the difference, because concerns their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter was prohibited to travel outside.
The courts have prohibited the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on child, expatriation in France and Spain.
The judges have imposed a banner of six months after he has expressed the authorities who have controlled it, his intention to go to Spain through France.
The Police to Kent announced this prohibition of the last Jewish traveling after testing the leaders the guilty of Glitter for sexual abuses on child.
Glitter, or his true name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the audience of Ashford's limited jurisdiction courts, but he was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court word door stated "July 25 September at Ashford's court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd of traveling in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."

It must be obligated to report the authorities if he wants to go to the stranger for more than three days.
He also needs to report the police, 7 days before its date of department.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could purify a penalty until five years of declaration.
The Kent police stated that it would not discuss specific cases or potential movements of Glitter in the content.
A door of the Kent Police said, "The Kent police will make everything necessary to protect our children as strangers.
"Well we, it is easier to monitor someone remaining in the United Kingdom because we have able to control any potential risks, so much more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's residents is the most dear interest in Kent Police, and we will watch the conduct of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region to minimize potential risks for public."
. Glitter was returned to the United Kingdom last month, after cleaning 27 months in a Vietnam prison for abusing of two girls, respectively, 10 and 11 years.
When he was left, Glitter took the airport for Bangkok from where he would have bought for a flight to London.
But he states that he doesn't feel good, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in the control of passports, and at the end he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter into their territory, and it was therefore obligated to share in Bangkok; Thai and the mission officers invited to return to England.
Finally, he arrived to Heathrow Airport 3 on 22 August, and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's limited jurisdiction court, West London, for registered in the list of persons accused of sexual abuses, such as Scotland Yard.

A source of the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was rejoiced and happy to know that Glitter had been prohibited movements in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" G√ºnther Bauer - Photography
We don't have any strange clothes.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the detention of man or woman.
On the other hand, the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimity, in these unknown moments of the great public, where it is discovered at intime management and views of artists who do not want to go to the scene.
German G√ºnther Bauer melanges in "Flamenco - people" the teatrality of some in scene with songs, dances and guitarists with this side less known by artists.
In this project, the photograph renews the special iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Inklusive in the Programming of the Moon of the Flamande Photography, the exposition "Reflexes the international importance of the flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" may be any one who, after seeing the photos, the observer is considered that it is not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on the scene of passion, suffering, joy... in capture of the public.
To capture these artists' personality moments, you don't need to make photos on scene.
They have a personality and a own character.
What I was interesting was to create an immediate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the photocam of the stars' personality moments. "
With the festival "Public Cunt of Mines", Bauer started a long journey to photograph music, guitarists or dances with a platform photo device.
These are portraits that, through the selection of the camera and the hardware, remember the classic photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means is broken with the classic side of the image, given him a modernity key, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional rances that develop and who surround every day."
It is not the dance or the song in himself, but the personality and the character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The research of the essential and magic was the constant of this work that is present in the El Fotomata gallery.
The vials of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Channels, Vicente Amigo, are part of the election from about sixty photographed artists.
The project was transformed into an anthology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's Portraits has brought it to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Sportart Project" "Sportart Project".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing it by people, know them and can enter their life for a moment more or less longer.
I think in the photography it's the most difficult kind of.
You're looking for people, persons that you don't know sometimes or who just leave you a few minutes to make them a photograph.
Despite these circumstances, as photograph, I always try that my ideas become real."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, which includes "Flamenco - people", is published in the Gallery El Fotomata, located at the 20th of the street of the Mata (parallel route to Hercule Peupleraie), which will be opened until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesss that the roman that he wrote is "audace"
The Roman is deployed in places that nobody knows and treats unknown subjects, but once more, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to prevent the new project on which he works, a Roman who has for the main personality of Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in Congo and has passed through Amazonia.
The favorite to the Nobel Price of Litture has confessed yesterday in the Hay festival Segovia, that the Roman who now busys it is "the real aid" and that "all show that he should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it, and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his intervention in the celebration of ideas and thoughts that for four days he saw a hundred of writers, historicals and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected personage of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who carried the price of Hay Festival to the majority of the votes of participants, made a joint room with the Teacher John Bravo.
The representative of the Festival, Felix Romeo, was found in face to a fascine public who didn't see the past time when Peruvien, with a wonderful memory and with a large dose of humor, retracted the birth of his literary vocation, which is caused to "sa seep of reading" and "live of new experiences", as he wrote of a very methodical "man" by a intense documentation work, correcting and receiving a part of the text to do before his "manning", how Faulner, Victor and Alexer, influenced his vocation and how his inspired Romans inspired.
The Spanish American Romancier recognized that "no means" to measure and know whether books change the life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an emotional experience," underlined Vargas Llosa, who said that "the effects" and "rend the less similar people," because it was asked to the writers "not leave the freshness" and to assume their call.

At the next day, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two bands planted on the bottom of the board and a cutting ear that the degrees found appreciated more than his fight in himself with the board.
Better for El Julie, who has entered in Los Llanos' arrens without pain or glory.
When he was fighting with the second board, after a very better fight, he had been siffled by most of the public.

Calls prayed for the close Federation of the Left Union to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Deputy of the Left Union, Gaspar Callamazares, stated today that it is the regional federal decision to take on the case of the old Council of Youth and Sports of Seville's Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has demissioned the last week after having been accused of committing treatments to the members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federal, and this will be the low organization that should assume its responsibilities," said Lalamazares about the conduct of the political party that he should adopt within the municipal Council of Seville.
However, the Leader of the Left Union asked the research to prove "transparency" for the irregularity that Silva could say: "The left Union has always defended this kind of business to have a maximum level of transparency."
He also submitted that the political party has "extreme ethics codes for all officials."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's pari oxygen
In inspiring reports of Benito P√©rez Galld√≥s, Jos√© Luis Garci rebuilds the celebrated Spanish battle against the French Sangre of May, which is the most ambitiative film of his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
The cineatric tried "to scene the many persons and the social analysis" which he always was impressed in the work of the Romancier celebration, has he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevard would be on the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two hours and half," Sangre de Mayo' will make its outcome in the next Friday Cinema Sales, which will then become a series of TV for Telemadrid more than four hours.
Great Admirator of Galdolos' literature, Joseph Luis Garci ensures that he had completed with this "a child dream" by Esperanza Aguirre, who carried it three years ago, to turn a commorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, what he always accepted when the report was in national history.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community are for Garci a "unique opportunity" to play with decors and clothes appropried the ambition of a Spanish who was threatened by chief for battle, since the fight for independence led the people to rebelions under the Firdinand VII kingdom.
But the cineast does not have received a finance as for the films "Capitaine Alatriste" or "The Fantoms of Goya" - more than double of that obtained for "Sangre of May" - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc√°rcel, with which he worked at nearly all his carrier.
The cineast of "Return has started" has influenced his normal way to work, on the implementation of actors, with which he has the habit to repeat before starting the tournation and to whom he does not make casting, because it looks like "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the cineast is to go to the teatro and the cinema to be reported."
Many actors in the "Sangre of May" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Lara√±aga or Fernando Guill√©n Cervo.
Four candidates in Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films representing Spain this year in Hollywood's Academy, "Sangre de May", "Seven French billard tables" and finally the winter," the Avugles Turnesols," are not representatives of a young Spanish cinema, "what would be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a price.
"In the beginning you think you're working for the posterity, then you know that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make a film more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayon is set in the ball of the driving dance T√≥rtola Valencia
A weapon dance will also make hommage to a weapon dance.
Carmen T√≥rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren√ß T√≥rtola Ferrer) and a walking mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), is born in Triana's room and who at the age of three years will live in London with his family.
It was a free and special dancing dancing in the east dancing.
She was a passionary, pioneer of women's freedom, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist and vegetarian and plaided for the absence of the corset who stopped the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the story of the dance in Europe of the two-wars has fascinated Isabelle Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and this last one proposed me to interpret the ransom T√≥rtola Valencia, and that was incredible."
After the dance, we're not trying to tell his life, but to translate his way to think.
The titles of his dance have made me think about the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the papaillon" made me think of a cuban popular dancing and "the serpent dance" to some tangens.
His dance was sensitive and they told me that my way to dance was the same as the shenne, "like it.
The training of the scene was made by two marvelous contributions: the Miguel Poveda, who would sing again in Isabella in one of his spektrums, as he had done to "The open door", and the Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to cooperate with the one who was his eleven.
"Matilde transformate T√≥rtola in a mature personality.
I'm happy because she's accepted to play a role in my work and that's my honor."
The training was also made by the musical composition and the guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Moron; the battle of El Pajaro, and the violence of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of actor, Juanfra Ju√°rez, who plays the role of the eternal company of this kind of artists who were considered as dives.
This work also refers to the life of this woman that has been exempt in such a lot, especially for the time, such as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also in all Europe, because she was usually resident in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think these women have a great influence in their time and now no one knows and does not value his work," says Bayon.
The spectacle will start at 20:30 at the Lope of Vega Teatro
The publication of the "The Journal of a recently married poet" concluded by the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition of the "Recently married Poet Journal" in the Saint Stephen's church in New York, where Juan Ram√≥n Jimenez married with Zenobia in March 1916, was included in the framework of the activities provided by the Ministry of the Culture of Androvia to celebrate the " Triennat Zenobia and John Ram√≥n " (2006-2008), organized to meet the fifth year of the Concesion of the Nobel Literature Price and their deaths.
Thus, the " Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n " comes to his end with the re-edit of this work, with the International Congress that has been located in New York, with the restaurant of the Nobel Museum and with the inherent exhibition " Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez: this little light" that was inaugurated in the last month of May and who, after having visited in the various landing provinces, went to New York at the International Congress.
In the same way, the Ministry of the Culture of Andalousia buyed eight hundred exemplaries of the "The Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo P√©rez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most known poets.
America please less without Paul Newman
"God creates perfect persons
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is the Sally Field actry, who worked with him in "Absence of Malce", and well explains the despair of the American cinema, and all America, faces the cruel idea that Newman is not more than this world.
He had a pain to get a Oscar
He wasn't turned back from 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard time for everyone.
"Therefore what one feels over all expressions, and now I lost a big friend," wept Robert Redford, "My life and my country were better than his existence."
Nobody was afraid to become ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and burden markets are afraid, the estimation of the Americans has fallen well low, looking for dignity motives.
When the time is so hard and without reason to live, it remains not in human beings but the admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda for love Paul Newman.
He was incarcering for everyone a ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and winning causes, such as the foundation for the antidrogue fight created in the honour of his age deceived after a overdose and the creation of his own bio food mark.
It was a victory for a country who had a threat to impress themselves against a suitable food culture.
This expansion of admiration is Hollywood without taking attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another English, the occasionist Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked his carrier.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, was not named Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us the high bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one who trys to lose the screen like Paul Newman: being very honest and having a serious and far from the objectives.
This is not always easy or possible in the medical jungle of our days.
But there is one who tests, and Paul Newman is a example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years in Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even if the opportunities did not miss him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bifeck in my cold?" He had the habit of pleasing.
In the sky, he assists with orgue to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so normal in America.
"For all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been so honourable as the husband's devoted husband, the loved father, the grandfather's attention and the philanthrope," says he.
Madrid in the course of the Olympics Games of 2016
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympics games, after exit in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I ask if we're ready.
If we take the example of the course yesterday: we are not!
They call him the perfect course, but, according to me, it was the worst course I've never participated.
If they had taken account of all the errors occurred during the course, they would make the object of a remote note.
But let's consider everything in detail and from the beginning.
The errors start with a dose back, which will have you to go forward.
It's not bad but if they're going to move you, it would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic pocket for courses).
Well, no.
They did you just go there to take the dose (the first error, move only for it) and (a long file of wait) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the maillot (the second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy small size maillots with less tissu and less loved?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of course.
In the part of the fact that we need to go very early to remove the electronic puzzle, the waiting file is 15 minutes and, in addition, we need to leave his sack in the entrance.
The expectation has been longer than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible because 11,000 people are waiting for these courses.
Since there was a long file of wait, the competitions started and we didn't have left our sack in the entrance, although it was done, it would have been worse.
Furthermore, the rain has achieved the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which rebelions and assaults of the baraque.
I think about 500 people will have the pneumony tomorrow, and some people like me, we don't even figure in the classification with the exact time, because they gave me who, I think, did not mark the department correctly.
Of course, if they would ask me to quote a perfect course example, this would not even come to me.
So I think we can always dream of become the city hosted for J.O., 2016.
Microsoft search for a receptionist (virtual)
In the Conference on the Emergent Technology of the MIT Microsoft, a new human interaction reconnaissance system has been presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence, which is a little intelligence but can be able to fulfil some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in case of Microsoft, a ship to move to the campaign of the company) in response to what we have asked him during a conversation.
With a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are, which they are - including remembering what places they are busy - and hear and hear the key words of their conversation.
But to regroup them in accordance with discussion groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but it understands that it does not belong to the group that is intended to talk with it and that it is not part of the company.
She asked her if she's here to visit someone and she told her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All of this without blue screen.
It's fantastic.
But, of course, this represents the future.
Now the company has other things on which they concentrate, for example, on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week we talked more about a change of strategies in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and there will be no longer like associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the unexpectable applications instead of inutile applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategies is the welcome.
Microsoft was right, his operational system lost significantly but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who added to the theory according to which Google Chrome is the first start of the Google part to make competition in Windows.
Many people have just underlined that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis to understand the computer and software.
It takes the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your beautiful mother.
That's right.
He will never disappear, but we must see the "dead" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Balmer confirmed this idea.
People are at least at least at the operational system but more in the Internet browser.
Only the computer is going to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people pass more time to ship on the Internet than to watch windows.
Who serve the half of the applications provided with the system?
Whoever can be at least.
And Windows 7 should contain less applications, much less than Visual.
More worse, months income, less complex.
For this time, Microsoft is more interested in the launch of their own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They have unexpectedly needed this, in fact, and I show you a example.
The photo presented in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the reserved Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the Drink distributor, one shows them to use their own search tool - "That search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a late occurred in the new Windows Mobile 7.
She will not go out at the beginning of 2009, but to the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks like more than a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them love.
The Fabulous Marcel
Paul Picasso led him on the Coast of Azur, Leonardo di Caprio, in the 'Diamant' of Edward Zwick', as well as Al Pacino in 'The Parrain' of Francis Ford Coppola, and is part of the holding of the association of muscles.
And if we set up all of his apparences, we could also quote this moustachu cost that had put pounds in a walking circle.
It's not just a simple masculin body maillot in coton, mutant and without manch.
The English calls it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels is different among all others.
First, by his name flamboyant - although he is known under the name of "Marcel" - who has to see with the sport because he takes the name, according to the legend, the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the song Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinct from others by its excellent coton, by its uniseen coffee, by its separate logo and by the small belge travel (recommendible) that the most known body maillots have in the cow.
But attention, because Belgian mark does not only produce tank tops.
But she also produces sweat-shirts, back boxers, cadding cardiants, coton pantalons, babys, mini-shorts...
Works designed for consolidation of subtractions.
Even if it's painful to bring them just as sub-kleds.
They're too charm.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry."
His great comparison with his sister did not stop developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters are very serious to take their new activities in mode.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and beautiful girls who offer their name.
She was presented to the promotion that Mango mark made in Paris to her new social seat but also to the presentation of the most important prices of the mode than Spanish house.
Monica is chaleureous and fearful.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new automne-hiver saison, but also to assist the second edit of Mango Fashion Awards and the Feeding of Opera in Valentino's Honor.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, we wait.
What based on your new collection created for Mango for this fourth saison?
The cinema of the 50 and 60 years we enjoy and we inspire it much for our collections.
I love a lot of balling in the city and watching women to see how they're habilled, how they combine their clothes, I'm often doing it.
You're a very polyvalent woman, actress and desinator, isn't it?
I think I am, but at the end, it's all together, and these activities have many common things.
Since I was all small, I would like to go to my grandmother to look at the armors of my tank and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better to go to the attractions park.
Then, when I was danced, I always tried to take care of my way to smile me.
Dancers love very well to play for courses and tests, to look at the mirror and feel well.
And in the role of activity, when you dress the clothes is at the moment you really put yourself in the piece of personality.
It's all connected.
You haven't been 30 years ago, was that hard for you?
Not all of it.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years have me happy.
I find that the woman is more mourner, has more experiences and save life with less problems.
The biological horloge doesn't fear me.
I did all that I wanted to do from every little, and that gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So you think you're gonna be Mom?
Of course, I want to be mom because my body asks me, and more, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose this.
I don't worry about the candidate.
What I'll do is to give my son much happy and to elect him with a loving love.
Let's go to the cinema, you're waiting for the different films you turned out the last year.
That's right, I'm sure they're out.
I'm a woman out of the teater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now, but, of course, it's not possible.
I've tried to succeed the films 'The last hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
To see what you're thinking...
A few days ago you started on the ship with Naomi Campbell, right?
Don't do that!
I didn't go on the ship to make the mannequin.
Instead, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her since no longer, to invite me to participate in London to a defiance of welfare for his association for support to women and clothes we would have exhibition - I have exposed two clothes of our collection created for Mango - were sold to pay money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person in the heart of trembling.
They say so much about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Furthermore, that's so good to Naomi.
She asked me to defeat for a reason so noble, but if she asked me to do that, I would even do it.
The important is to make life better to women in the third world.
Alcohol decisions on the volant should install the 'alcolock' system
The Ministry of the Interior wants that the conductor who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol should be installed in his vehicle, a system that stops to start the vehicle in an urban state, or if it does not suffer.
The initiative was already announced in the last month of June, and it appeared then in the report of the Ministry of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will perform a year.
His goal is the reinsertion of the conductor by proposing rural reduction courses.
The Ministry of Road Security, but also the General Director of Route Security and the Technology Foundation for Automatic Security, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the cars arrested to lead more once once once in the stage, retract the car.
The alcohol would disappear that because it is a branch system on the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the hale and stops starting the vehicle if the driver does not suffer before; or when the alcohol level of the driver is above the authorised.
His cost is more than 1,000 euros and is carried out by the driver.
In this regard, a study held in the United States in 2007 showed that the equipped vehicles of this device reduced to 65% of the infractions during the first year of installation.
And in Spain we consider that this could save life for 115 people each year.
This measure is only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to face these conducts before they are transformed into criminal infractions.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform may be made by regular ways, but the reform made by criminal ways requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market under no commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental title.
Tomorrow, the Deputy Congress will vote a initiative of the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install in the school buses of this system as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without Peep Toes
At 17h40, the official time provided, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princess of Astury traveled in Hangar President of the Airport Benito Ju√°rez from Mexico DF.
The sun was on the ground to sleep, but his rayons were still obligated to put his hand in a visa guidance to see the king's couple down from the air.
At the feet of the scale, the Spanish embatter and other authorities were present.
A few hours before I asked in the street, the taxi chauffeur, if it was at the moment that the Spanish Princes visited the city to finish their official travel.
- Oh, well, we can't go to the airport to take customers at that hour... are you out of here or then...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here in two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexico press knows very well who are the princes of the Asturians and knows the importance of the travel.
They are many to wait in the airport hangar near the red tape and a combined military rang of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smile and smiled with blue sea, Princess, when he has the hairs of the wind, is very excited and does not take its normal "peep-toes"; maybe they told him that an occasion was threatened.
They take a short stop at photographs before they go to the room where the official court waits for them.
At the door of the hotel where they log in, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigolo journalist of the Mexico TV waiting for them.
The most precise price of the mode
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a mode price than Paris and there is no more extraordinary designer than Valentino.
Mango came to present the second edit of the Bot√≥n-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new talents of the mode.
The vendor will be rewarded by a price of 300,000 euros.
Yes, Sandrina Fasoli, the document went out of the first edit winter, looked at its models in Mango's vitrine at 54 buulevard Haussmann in Paris and wept nearly emotionally.
Of course, it is the second largest magazine of the mark in Europe, which comes to be inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first boot is located in London.
Events, and the desire to thank Valentino, president of the concourse jury, have made us in a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier of Paris.
With a close table, the extraordinary family Chagals, the preside table prepared by Mango, was still more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and done against the bad good heart, because of his recent death of his brother, Nati put a mango clothing and some ELAH pairs, who burned the suffering, and his arms on the top with his son Luis - a beautiful man of almost two meters of high ‚Äì she came with Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honour.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a galent man, and the Rotchil Baron ended the evening without clothes because they had prepared them to two women.
Monica Cruz, who was presented to the magazine with a pantalon and a chemise ‚Äì of his own collection - and whose for lunch was metamorphosed with a long sexy and black clothes, was embarrassed when during the evening visit of the Opera, with Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of ballet repeatations and remembering the good old time, she took one of the bars and made the guest of a greater growth.
Ines Sastre is not left for the visit of the palace dependences, but she showed us before on her portable phone of her son's photos.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart√≠nez ‚Äì another beautiful man who moves in moto - and John Travolta, who came to Paris's intercontinental hotel, with his draps, his services, and asked the prealable, that there is no orphans in his room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenness of the day life.
And to cure all, they are all in a book that will bring relax to the libraries on 30 September.
The morning's wake up almost attracts us when he dreams every morning at 7 hours, but it's still worse when we think about the agency ritm that we put the present life.
The office is synonymous of tension and the computer of sufferers in dose.
The stress represents the evil of the XXII century.

Talk to sleep
Some children speak during the night.
I don't tell those who are very awake by telling us something that happened on the day before, but to children who speak during their dream.
The first time this happens, it can surprise you, but it actually doesn't matter.
It's a welcome apartment of the dream that is called somniloquia.
It's too fresh, especially in children and children.
It's sure there's more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sportly (once in life, for example, associated with a strong fever episode), or more periodically (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything more.
There is no unique cause that determines its apparence
They are often linked to other shadows, such as chambers, night fears, nocturn enursees (pipi fever at bed) or sonambulism, but it is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress or surexciting situations.
It's a little study phenomenon.
The intensity with which it produces is also very variable.
He can speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurers or contrary with crying, weeping, long talks ...
In the case of the dreaming becomes very frequency, it would be judicial to observe the child and to consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of accuracy and to get an explanation to this problem.
We said that it's a welcome alertation, so there is no treatment, except if it is linked to another dream that can be sown (e.g. if it is linked to a dream of dream or stress).
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before he goes to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and disappear programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children and who have pain to depart, relaxation technology can be used to help them be quiet inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful dream.
As soon as the dreams appear to be quiet.
Remember that they are unexpected for the child and that the next day he will not remember more than what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him up.
It's inutile because he's unknown and you'll wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and so relaxs.
Remember that if he is very angry for several times, he is recommended to consult a doctor or to check what he offers so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (what is not normal), do not try to ask it to get information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleeping, he's not aware to organize his thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what it's in dreaming, you'll take care of the way you'll interpret the information and the conclusions you're taking it.
Don't tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Don't even happy.
This makes a lot of anxiety.
Finally, don't worry, that's nothing bad, it's an episode that's only a few minutes.
View... end
Illaeusern finally found the way of the victory on his territory after a long time of dishes.
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Blacks have created the largest number of opportunities and have successful to transform one for the wine of the match.
The rhythm was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had been bad to express themselves.
After a first trial of Captain Kauffmann's visitor, who broke the lantern on a remote shooting, Illaeusern was to take easily the steel and turn to Fonderflick from far away, then with Hirn up, Roman from the foot of the feet, or even Diebold came to chat the defense of Danemaria.
In face, we were blocked in the middle of the area and just left Riahi to the attack point.
The beginning of the second half-time was to be decided first with two cases signed Riahi and Temporal for Danemaria, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illusions by Marais, well positioned to retrace a restrained ball on the first temptation of Diebold (53e).
But the Ilhousian buyer can't save his long-term happiness and will be obligated to reaggle the clothes a 12 minutes later and to leave its coaches in digital lowerness.
But Dannemaria will not be able to benefit, and will not put great problems to a 18th illhouse who just turned a little back to his defense, horms in all the last seconds of game where, after a big coffee, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy to meet fishermen in cold
Before you turn for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a department from the United Kingdom.
In order to demonstrate fishing forces that have been extremely perturbing the access of several breton and normal ports, the President of the Republic decided to be married to the Guilvinec port in the Finist√®re to meet their representatives.
These lasts have promised to advise him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals."
A presidency visit that falls at the same time when a general assembly of the "Crysis Committee" created by the broad fishermen to get measures faced by the prices of the gas, which has received a record of more than 1,14 euros by average litre.
According to Elisee David Martinon, the President will "debatte with them the solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to find competitiveness and to ensure the conditions of employment and remuneration of marine."
Nicolas Sarkozy is waiting for the fishing feet.
Tomorrow, they sent scargot operations to Morbihan and Calvados, at the time of 10 miles.
The Quiberon's pleasure port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filter barrier has been carried out on the Kiberon Island nearly.
The seas have already shown their determination in burning, since the eggs, pneus and palettes before Brest's carburants deposits, and Lorient, while demonstrations were disappeared to Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has been promoted to other ports of Atlantic and Manche, such as the Olone Sables, in Vendee, where the chalutiers remained in cai, or in Havre, where twenty ships have blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of The Turball and the Cross, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped the block of the most important raffinary total of Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mari decided to wait for the meeting of mercredi in the ministry to decide eventually.
In Guilvinec, the "Crysis Committee" must actually decide March of the follow-ups to be given to the movement and its participation in the Agriculture and Party.
However, some brown fishermen don't want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
"The greeting will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "the fishermen will not want to move to Paris", for example, Liliane Cariou, the President of the Committee of the Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fisheries, which do not suffer gas rates, are currently approximately 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the ship's rentability level is only achieved with a low gas gas than 0.30 euro.

By 228 voices against and 205, the representatives refused to the Secretary-General to the Tresor Henry Paulson.
Before two Republicans on three, they rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," estimated Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial FTN.
"This shows how the market has been counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days does not happen "trop later".

Obama, winning at the points of the first television
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, another succeeded to know who brought it from John McCain or Barack Obama.
Unfortunately, the Republic and Democratic QG had pronounced their own victory in this TV that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
The political analysis David Gergen believes that John McCain, although honourable, was not enough "brilling" to allow him to put his low down to five weeks of the president.
The Gallup Institute, whose publication investigation of the Sabate, provides an advance of five points in Obama (49% against 44% in McCain), judges that it is the democracy that has taken its exploitation of the game.
In the non-decisive electorers, which are those who count, Obama has been winning for 39% of the sounds, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS sonage.
Obama should be able to confirm his Jewish advance with the good advantage of his colleague, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be an error of the sub-value.
She has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton prevented this weekend.
The Sevengenerary McCain had not stopped to put his unexpectable experience on foreign policy, although underlined the "face" of his adversary on these questions that were in the heart of this first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that" he accused a few times.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has experience and know it necessary to be president," he also assures.
An angle of marted attack since yesterday in the Republic TV publicities.
Obama, he, submitted that he represented the future.
Without demonting, he has shown consciousness and precise.
He made his ability to take good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, yes," retorted this weekend, a lot of democratic democratics to the Republican to have not taken all the measures of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"When John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, he denied Obama, yesterday, before 20 000 people collected for a electoral meeting in North Caroline under a battant rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "employees"." The financial breaking clearly benefited by Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most like to save the economy at the front of the precipice.
"The future week may be a decisionful turner," estimated, yesterday, the democratic senator Charles Schumer influenced.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debat is "the final verdict of eight years of an evil economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that even to reduce the 95% of the American emphasis, although Wall Street's sufferings, the Senator of Illinois also stated that the implementation of an energy independence in the country by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the implementation of a health-security system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear centres from here to 2030.
Of course, the two candidates have issued questions on the financial safe plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely imputable.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there was a choice, you?"
Young and opposers showed the Sunday evening on the main place of the Bielorusa capital to refuse the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of the Bielorussia were gathered tomorrow after the closement of vote offices on the central place of Minsk to protect the fraudulent character of legislation.
While no result was yet announced, many young people came to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, demission."
Some advise not to vote, "What good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said a young man.
They don't believe that the regime that has made a good figure to strangers in order to take language with the European Union is ready to implement a democratic tour.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 bielorustic leaders and the yellow of certain haves, could be lifted up if these elections were considered as proper by observators.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We have been held out of the electoral committees and our observators could not participate in the despair," declared Jouri Potemkine, the door of the Union of Democratic Forces, a herogenic regroup of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change, sublined Alexandre Milinkievitch, an old candidate of the opposition to the President of 2006 and the officer of the Pro-European movement file, because it's important to take account of the voices, and in our house, it's the executive power.
If the President of the Opposition enter into the Parliament, they will be named, not election.
But their introduction to the Parliament may mean space for TV, meetings in regions and law proposals."
Therefore, the opposition must be entered into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be taken.
Because if our economy, which is seriously encouraging against Russia, enter into crisis, and we don't reform, we are risked to become a Russian protector.
And we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the scrutin.
It underlines that participation numbers appear too high, and that the generalization of vote by anticipation (26% of the electorers in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was a choice, you?" asked the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in voting offices.
And there will be at least five deputates of the opposition to the Parliament, those who are the best to the power."
The silence of the night is back on the place of October.
In the television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Committee welcome their success.
The interview - blood returns safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday on the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his President, Dr. Francine Decary, had the right to joy, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
And in particular, he recognised the confidence of the public that was seriously broken by the blood scanding in 1980 and 1990.
As it is known, the national blood reserves controlled by the Canadian Croix Red Transfusion Service have been condemned by the virus of the accused immunodeficiency (VIH) and the virus of the hepatitis C in 1980.
Before this drame and the branch of the public, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public investigation presided by the Court Horace Krever, a investigation to make light on the circumstances led to such tragedy and to form recommendations that such disaster would not be reproduced.
While the Court Crever was launching his report, certain provinces then have made a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, G√©lineau Committee completed this mandate.
Following the reports of G√©lineau and Krever, two providers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to maintain Quebec and Canadian blood society to approve all other provinces and two territorys.
"In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started his activities, at least 38% of the people had still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, he remembers Dr. Decary.
The situation was humble.
In strength of efforts to improve the safety of blood and work products on the ground during the following years, we have reached public confidence," she said, "forward to ensure that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population whobecoise had then trusted in Hema-Quebec.
Three Decary, however, watchs that "the trust is something extremely fragile."
After his creation, on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec applied the principle of precaution.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe in the absence of human form of the disease of the folly vaccine, a new variety of Creutzfeldt-Jakob‚Äôs disease, telling that it has been strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we don't know everything if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then supported on one of the main recommendations of Krever and G√©linoeau reports, in which when we don't know it, and that a serious disease can disappear it, in the event of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which characterized by an unbelievable degeneration of the brain, is established by exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we therefore refused the blood of people who had lived more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But a few years ago, it was shown out of doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the principle of precaution that we have applied was a sense."
In 1999, a higher sensitive technology of the HIV depth was shown on the market: nuclear axis tests (TAN) that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not the anticorps against the virus, on which the tests used to others.
The TANs have allowed to recurrence the mute period, which is stretched between the time when the person has been infected and the one where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our technical, explains the specialist.
We could reduce this period to a lower period for a week.
The risk of certain donors have been infected without knowing it and we can't detect them.
These improvements have allowed significantly achieve the risk of contracting the sida by a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of over 12 millions is the risk of received from the HIV blood.
"In other words, this means that it should be distributed 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, this will take over 24 years before a case of HIV transfer by a blood product.
I think we can feel in the eye of receiving or prescriving a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Quebec's head.
"Our deficit for the next decade is to maintain security of our products.
We never know what pathogene will earn in the system.
Not after the past year appeared on the island of the meeting the Chikungunya virus, who, in the presence of the Western Nil virus, is transmitted by an insect into blood.
It must be constantly watching," continues the Decary Tree before submitting that in more than a security approval, Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient approval.
"The needs increase because the old population.
Anticancerious treatments are more agressive, patients often need a reloading in red or plaquets.
The age of the population has also consequences on the blood donors network that are not in the middle of 3% of the Quebecs admitted to blood donation."
Every person in health, 18 years old and more responsible to admissibility criteria can, however, give blood every 56 days, or six times per year.
In the middle, 14% of the people who propose their blood are not accepted because they are achieved from the sida or the malaria, for example, and if they have traveled in a country where the paludismo has seen, they will be excluded for a period of a year.
"Besides these three percent, we will maintain a inventor that responds to the needs of hospitals.
The penurias are very weird.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they are old and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
The life of this day is so scared, we are rarely found the time to pass for a time to give his blood," discovered Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including gas plugins, cardiac valves, ocular balls and pearls that are almost exclusively used for great burning.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and congeled before they are entered to Emma-Quebec, which also controls the only public blood bank of cordon in Quebec.
The ambilical cordon that was considered as a biomedical dead is a rich blood in soil cells that can use to treat severe diseases such as leucemia.
"We have fed, a few weeks ago, the bank of our miles of cordon blood, and we are expected to prevent more than thousands per year.
We should begin to propose for plugins at the beginning of the next year," says Dr. Decary, which describes this programme of blood preliminary as very popular.
"Mama's long-terms are deceived that you can't have access" because Hema-Quebec has no way to propose this complex and cost programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Imagine in Half-End
The Impact of Montreal was qualified for the half-final round of the exchange series of the first division of the USL, through a victory of 3-1 (4-3 to total objectives) to the expenditures of the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, at the second and decimale part of the quarters of the total of the objectives, in Saputo State.

Short - But Victorious of Kovalev
The trio number one of Canadians is ready to train saison.
The composed unit of Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a gain of 3-2 of Canadian at the face of the Panthers of la Florida, last night in the Center Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec increased two helps, and Kovalev collected a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparations.
Kovalev gave the victory to mark the only objective of the fusilation.
"I'm not ready yet, I prevented Russian.
I need another match to hear me at the east."
"He tried too much to do in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a beautiful oneion."
Carest on the North
The first Minister does not exclude the elections before the end of the year
Instead of the general advice of the Liberal Partie, Jean Charest was held yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to take place in the opportunity of the party election today.
"Repose the borders of our last large border of the North": such is the long-term ambition that John Charest has presented with visual force in the large lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Partie of Quebec, at Levice, yesterday.
After him, during his conversation, it was designed a sort of Moulin to images.
They turned into bucle, on three large screens, spectacular clicks of hydroelectric bars, miner exploitation, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", cards, etc.
Great means as in electoral period.
In the pressure, in addition, the Prime Minister refused to exclamate that he would declare the elections of this car, even if he noted that his time was very loaded.
The "Plan North" is the fourth bread of a "vision" which the first Minister suggests to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an understanding on the hand-doing work with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and the Entity with Ontario.
Recently mentioned in the discussions of the first Ministry, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the Parallel 49th - has never made the object of a presentation.
However, the first Ministry was urged to explain why the North was "happy to the great potential," but he did not give the end of the investment amounts, nor of precise priority in the future projects.
All of the most avenues of what could be developed more: including hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, duplicated by the growth of the countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructures.
North contains "Nickel, zinc, cuivre, platine, or, silver, ferry, titan, and even diamant," according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "territorial twice big as France", "it's home in us, it's in Quebec.
It's not just in our house, but it's in us," he insisted, as to show that he was concerned with a national funder.
The Quebec was very built in his relationship with the North, he sublined: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the chebecoise engineer, the Baie James.
"This is our future to us," he added, after he made a teatrale break to look at the big card behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebec Territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always been invested, has appointed the first Minister at the press point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there is no understanding since long and, when the opportunity is present, I reiterate this position in the name of the government," he said.
In the rest, "with climate changes, we need to repeat our vision of the North," he said by talking about the north-west passage, which will be opened all year because of the source of glass.
In this new geopolitic context, the Prime Minister considers that occupy the territory is a debt.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First United Nations and the Inuits?
The first Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful for them and that the project would benefit them, in particular to young people.
Two elders from two different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Letourneau (ancient deputy of Uganda) have already been addressed by consultations at a 30-year communities.
An inter-ministry committee before Benoit Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has taken a major place to work.
The first Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summary," but a moment when "We will give a common vision."
The North Development would also be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and respective of the environment," he promised.
John Charest described this "vision" as continued with the first Liberal Ministry who had before it.
"Come the liberals that have been before us, we have considered otherwise to transform disasters into new growth and development opportunities."
This was also one of the recurrent themes of the weekend, which was held by a large cocktail to subline the 50th anniversary of the coming of John Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rebapt the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, in Lesage, who made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa, who made the Baie James, our part has forced the future," said John Charest.
In pressure, he invited another, conservatory, the program "Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, the first Minister of 1957 to 1963.
With the project of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest submitted that its service was prepared for 2012.
"It remains among us, but I'm supposed to be there," he trusted his military men, raising food approvals in their house.
In fact, the first Minister, who had said in April that there was no choice in 2008 and, of course, in 2009, did not exceed the possibility to declare a scrutin, which the law allows him.
He submits that his timery is yet full, particularly by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summet.
The General Council of the weekend has provided the Liberal Chief a platform containing national resolutions, including the "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ claims, in particular the recognition of "Quebec's speciality" in the Constitution.
It also wants to be called the Quebec members of the Council ' s radiodiffusion and the Canadian telecommunications and that these recently had a right to veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we have obtained the large lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The pequest chief, Pauline Marois, resorted the North-du-Quebec Development Policy that the Government Landry was launched in 2001.
According to it, the Liberal Government, when it arrives to the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done it, "We would be more advanced today", Mrs. Marois commented on the side of his candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin who has been today), France Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a spectacle," commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, in substitution of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacances today.
Letters - A desolate country
This is Mr. Vic Toews, the ex-minister of the "Justice" (O Ironian) in the Harper camp, which allowed the last year to say to Louise Arbour that she was a "hood" for Canada.
Thus, the opposite of this woman who has sent an insufficient battle for justice and that measures all our admirance as long as he says about the first Minister's attorney and on Stephen Harper himself.
We are in the presence of a government that is the only government, among all the west countries implied, that we have not reaped his resident closed in the Guatanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young boyfriend at the time of the facts that he was closed to him.
The only government that, on the basis of the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, rejects his word and allows to cross in human conditions a child-sold.
The only one who is returned to a parody of justice to assess the accusation.
Remember, for memory, UNICEF, International Amnistie and the Association of the Canadian Barreau, in particular, pleasant for the Repatriation of Omar Khadr to benefit from a correct procedure in Canada.
It is the same government that shuts the eyes on torture: it does not mean that a young adult is then psychologically destroyed, without doubt after many years of exactions.
We don't yet take account of it, but we are at this time asking an insidiant exhaustion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper stops to brand and dreams so crew in his mouth.
Here comes the time where no moral exists: we can disobey, torture, arbitrally engage a Canadian citizen according to the good desire of a Government captain to this minority (which will then be after 14 October...).
Many electors believe that they will find the salvation in a part that predicts the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they don't see that this government has renounced the reputation and the dignity of our country.
The honour, Mr. Toews, she's here in this renewment, and not more.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold orwellians
In his edition of 17 September, the Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mineral Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logic, this indicates that the largest arcade company of the world has tried to continue a difference of six millions against three authors and a small house of editing without the purpose to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of disagreement, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to make a public debate would she bring to the ruin whose bones supports a contrary position to the shenne?
Increasingly the examination of the process, the authors and the editor of the Black Canada book will have to expenditure significant sums to prepare their defense and fight, very inequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these inequalities, is also often to destroy the defenders to introduce a regulation to the friend who will build the opposite to anybody will be struggled again on the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public thinking that she had had to present her vision of facts.
In contrast to what happens in many countries in which Barrick Gold works, the discussions in Canada are usually made by the switch of ideas and not in matrace.
It was therefore enough to open its books, the magazines, and to establish a real debate through journals, media, publications and funding independent research teams that could make light on the question.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to be trusted in the public thinking and refused from turning from the hand the penitentiaries and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can at times ask a "public" debate while preventing the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word designs only the lawyers paid grassfully and not all the Canadians; this is a most extreme view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What doesn't understand - or don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Black Canada is done before that he refuses the brutal way of the mineral.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized changes of arguments, and not in the framework of what many perceive as a continuous building (for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has come to stay in the place of Black Canada's authors, trying to disappear the use of this term...).
Besides the surreal talk of Mr. Garver, Barrick Gold continues a direct attack against the liberty of university research and the search of truth, essential to all democratic society.
It does not, in block, the right to citate creditive sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that move to the riches of this world in a country such as Canada, under the pain of repeat continues, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it according to the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment, where we are, has a long time to handle discussions and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold continues to decrease clearly that, in contrast to what she suggests, she does not have a transparency.
It's a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it's time that governments set up devices limited to this kind of abusive continue.
Wall Street Safety Operation - Democrates and Republicans are listed
The administration of Bush and the officers of the Congress, at the time of Republic and Democratics, finally came to a agreement yesterday on the largest economic safeguard plan since the Great Depression of the 30 years.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars in order to raise the financial crisis that seeks Wall Street for months has to be inside by the two rooms of the Congress.
It provides particularly: a better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the income public money, new provisions to contain the number of inserted houses for default payment, as well as a view to the payments provided to the leaders of safe enterprises.
The American Secretary-General in Trezor, Henry Paulson, President of the room of representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative on the treaty table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes later, yesterday, in terms of a marathon of negotiations for two days.
"We have accomplished great progress for an understanding that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been made a way to open real economy and the ordinary Americans of the crisis in Wall Street," explained the Democracy.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the traumatism, the chaos and the perturbations on the daytime life of the Americans will be great," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the humor of investors.
The time which was given was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American President's election have been most favorable to the understanding, however, without the absence of expressing their disagreement that it is obligated to happen to this extr√©mity.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama was assigned to add some provisions to the understanding, in particular the purpose of allowing owners to maintain their homes and the payment of the leaders of the undertakings referred to by the State.
"When the contributions are requested to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of certains, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the forests of the American TV.
He asked another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his republican, John McCain, answered, "I would like to see the details, but I hope that it is."
"The big lines I have read [screen] that it's something we're all going to divorce, and with which we're going to go forward.
The option to do nothing is not just acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is to recover with the money of contributions the duplicate, risk-efficient and investable rate of American financial institutions.
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis declared by the explanation of an immobiliar bull that first has carried into the extent of the risk rates (subprimes) before extending other forms of credit tickets (PCAA) and to move on a egg of liquidity and on the debt of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of republian eluses who had made the first understanding project last week.
It believes that the democracies have accepted that some "toxic" companies are only insured by the government, instead of purchasing.
In order to get the angles for everyone to the Congress, we also added a stipulating provision that if the Government had to achieve losses for five years with this programme, he could put in place new taxes for helping him to reach its implementation.
The new plan provides the verse of a first 250 billion track to which will be added 100 billion else if the President needs.
The verse of 350 billion other should be entered by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange of its assistance, Washington will get participations in safe enterprises that will be shared in the case of benefits and that it will be able to return when the tourism will be passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of retaining the input procedures relating to the residences associated with the immobilier prices concerned by this plan and to establish limits to remuneration and department departments to the leaders of the companies concerned.
The architects of the plan would like to see it under the vote of the Chamber of representatives today, and to the Secretary-General.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will have the green fire.
The votes have actually continued to rise yesterday against this project, as well as in the Republic and Democratic camp.
"In fact, Washington doesn't listen to you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Committee of the Chamber.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not what is to use contributions."
An animator of a small group in the Congress called "the cause of sceptics," the representative Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but it is the same conclusion.
"4 hundred enormous economy teachers, including three Nobel prices, have written us to say: we ask the Congress to not press and consider the way to take carefully," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had a new proof of the world's nature of crisis.
At the end of an urgent meeting, the three countries of Benelux announced the Partial Nationalization of the Fortis Bank Group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French BNP Paribas bank denied that she refused to acquire her competition in full ship since she had lost 2 billion euros (2,9 billion) in the crisis of immobilier prices to risk in the United States.
Fortis works 85,000 people and is part of twenty larger European banks and ten larger insurances.
"It's not the lost money, said the Netherlands Ministry of Finances, Wooder Bos.
In exchange, we receive a vote right in the bank and influence.
It's just something that challengers and menages now appreciate that the times are incertain."
During that time, on the other hand of Manche, the British Government seemed to nationalize another financial crisis.
According to the English pressure, the Government would review the total of the current costs in the Bradford and Bringley bank, which are more than 41 billion (75,5 billion dollars) of immobilier prices.
The Spanish bank Santander did know yesterday that she would buy the cuts and the accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after the Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an entailed icon
His beauty in the eye of the asher was longer his card around, and no one will say his lowness.
Have he been released from the Narcissic mirror, the American actor in charmeer smile?
Yeah and not.
His poor, his sensitivity and a talent that was broken out of the power record that born the true sacred monsters.
But what a big ground smoke!
Paul Newman, lost Friday, at 83 years, followers of a pulmon cancer in his ranch of Connecticut, remains one of the last American cinema of fast years.
My monumental as Brando, which he seemed, and whose long time he was a type of rival on the screen, more careful in his game, of course more fragile, but also the apostle of freedom and the exclamation of dramatic conventions.
The bloods often are beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European rains will be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
I'm not decreasing, the last quality mark.
Because in him, all an expensive country of self done man, the fighter of the Pacific War, who, at the beginning of the 50 years, studies the dramatic art in Yale, then freshed the Actor's Studio of New York, before triomphere to the teatro, at the television, at least to the cinema.
The same man who wars for citizen rights was also the car pilot who classed the second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a six-symbol, although a member of a couple of models formed since 1958 with the Joanne Woodward act.
They also separate the shadow areas of this secret star, discrete, gnashed, allergic to the show-business smokes, which will not actually perceive the enigm.
A honest man, in the meaning of the most noble term.
Paul Newman's loss has achieved the wind to the cinefills this weekend, while its big roles on the black screen of memories.
More than a halfth century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation defiled through it.
The young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning tooth adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Besides us (1990), we call his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who was born in his old age by a marriage who didn't fulfil all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have passed in the history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delining, turned, violent, unforgetable in somebody There Likes Me (Marqued by the hate), Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean, restored after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympatic malphrate in the brilliantsime The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A billard and winger player in the fantasy The Hustler of Robert Rosen (1961), he will retrace the personality on the return in The Color of Monney of Martin Scorsese, which values him in 1987 his unique Oscar for nine nominations.
That face through the age, it was him.
He's more.
Times are broken through their parks.
Young people know it especially through the Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), Reggie Dunlope, teacher of a hokey team on a little ortodox glass.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen in 1994.
With the last role of Irish mafia in Road to Perdition de Sam Mendes in 2003, the bulk was broken.
At the meeting of several lendings of the cinema that have left enough early, Newman will remain long in the seat, although denounced Hollywood, his orches, his fast and its consensus.
The French cineast Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "come a deficiency living at "lunderplaying" who judges his rewards too supported.
The profession has not always been tendent for the beautiful Paul Newman, where the roles have fallen for a long time every kitchen in the beck.
However, he played less often the younger than the marginal: negros, alcohol, salts or disappeared, which reflected its perfect treatment and revolutions.
As a realizer, Newman describes bad facets of his real pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (see the Canadian Roman Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traveled a female portrait of Melancolia.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, who works with poor and sorrow.
From the rain of hommages that went yesterday on Newman, his big company and old army company Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very attractive: "He has made my life and the best country."
Generality, love of existence is vibrant traits of the lost actor.
In this way, his leading carrier is also made a great military for citizen rights, the ecology, the independent cinema, a contemporary of Hollywood derives.
We'll be seen many of his binet throne on winegret pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judgeing the wrong seat process, although he won away.
Nevertheless, the benefits of these ventures were delivered to its Fund for the failure in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, he will be attached to the top.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: "To the end, your father was incredible to appreciate his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to follow the parking of an American artist so light and so generous.
They're a model, in the sum and on it.
What could be good to manufacture Suspenditure & amp; Company in their use of factures?
Next, 8 October, the audiences will be started reporting to the current penal procedure, against Janos Zuszett and its compliances.
The policy and his compliances are accused of scrokeries, under form of criminal organization, permanently and regularly, with particularly important pains, and other accusation leaders have been held against them, for example, false and use of false.
Following the park, the money of subventions was paid to personal purposes, while the prestations were justified by false facts.
The money of the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF totally, went from one part in the boxs of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and, on the other hand, in some persons.
Their method, also published by the investigation authorities, was to touch the money of the subventions obtained by exhausting cost facts, after which no real prestation was provided, and the associations had never respected their commitments.
According to the accusation act, a large part of the factures was failure.
For the last, they were looking for factures on the market of Josefvaros, while they made the secrets in Kiskunhalas.
For society names that were going to figure on the factures, it was decided, among others, during the north province of the Balaton lake, made by Steven Lados, on the request of John Zusfeld.
According to the deposition of this last, he had to repeat pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked a facture, on the model of which they had made the other facts they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Works, and of the Capitol's Municipality to access subventions.
The majority of the facts was created by Isv√°n Lados and by his companion Andras Timeri, who, according to our information, had been concerned to edit the documents necessary for the obtainment of subventions.
In a "reparation citizen", one of the Lados' choice was a bistro.
Following the two facts issued by the Suspenditure in 2003, this location ensures the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of the Association Biztos Pont Eines√ºlet.
However, according to the proposals of the manager, it would have been impossible that people at the same time build this place.
In the same way, since 2002, the facture was established in the name of the Job Further Foundation, which will then bring the name of Egypt in Harmadik Evezred, growth of forms and funds.
A pension located in Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms, and at least ten people could pass over the night. However, the facture mentioned hundred thirty clients.
The emergency factors in the declining imagination are also fallen in the excess when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, which also apparent to the Horeca sector. In their accountability, neither the name of Job J√∂v√µ, nor the Hoppa, according to the data information on the park.
Further Farkas, the manager of the company, said to the hvg.hu website that when the park called it and showed him the factures, he had himself, soon, that he was a false document.
"The name of our company and our tax number was placed on a bad place on the secret."
He added: "After the form, the fact that, after the facture, hundreds of people had lodged there, didn't go any more, because this institution has only ten rooms, which have not been so much.
Moreover, the facture also mentions food, and our restaurant is closed for a long time."
The exemptors of Z√©l√© facts are not yet informed about the Budapest traveling agents, which are part of their choices, but organizing only foreign travels. So, immediately, they have indicated residents in Hungary on facts to regulate in kinds of species, what is also going to meet accountable practices of agency.
In addition, as it appeared in the investigation, they also added the TVA to these documents, while the provisions on travel activities, which are located outside the European Union, are made without TVA.
In the same way, the TVA tax of the four factors established in the name of the Hotel Revf√ºlluk in the order of Job's day was wrong, since the benefits of the company does not support 25% as indicated, but a VVA of 15%. Moreover, the employees of the hotel are only expressed, while false facts were made in the hand.
The investigation of the park reveals that the "emittors" also committed errors as a result of the transport of markets per route, that the electricity of facts could not exercise, as its profile was the advice of investment.
Furthermore, it is also for shapes, such as types of inadequate factures and false secrets, that the factures emited to the Order of Contribution in Harmadik Evezred Standard, of XXI. Szazadi Cultural Institute and de Biztos Pont were discovered false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt., or the Sport Stage of Kunfehlo, which both do not be the authors of the factures issued in their name.
The fausers had not yet taken attention to the fact that the HIB Kft., established in Ny√≠regyh√°za, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the Fiatal V√°roselet group was determined to take a food to them. According to our information, it is why the liquidator of the company did not have missed this facture.
Factors established freely
Another category of factors is the composed of those who were actually known that he was asked for them to exhaust factors.
The foundation Esely Budapest for Based on the request of the Grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj√∫ Socialists, has established a facture in the order of the foundation Accommodation in Harmadik Evezred for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accusation act, the manager of Collab Kft. was amended to make false facts by one of the accused, Ludovic Gy√∂rfi.
Furthermore, a cooperation with the Zushits, the Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which is in 2003, has embarrassed facts in the order of the Job Further Foundation, based on the Association of Atlasz Institute and the Association of the Foreign Universe, for amount of about five million HUF, but after which there was no contribution efficiently provided.
There was no financial movement, not even seeing that the issued facts had been cancelled, but that, the organisations did well not mention it in their accountability.
The following category of electrical factures is the one of the companies directly linked to the accusers.
So, the Administrative Delegation of the Director General of the Delta Trio Kft., occupying the carburant and car carriers, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where there was not possible, Ivan Kubatov was.
In October, November and December 2005, this society has issued several facts on the sale of information equipment for about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would be buyed by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The Director of this company was a Roman origin, which Ivan Kubatov would also make documents related to the society between 2002 and 2005.
Following what we know, Kubatov recognised during the investigation that he had carried out facts in the order of Atlas, Hopp√° and of Usot in Harmadik Evezred, and that he has raised their anti-value.
It is exactly on the request of Ivan Kubatov that Roman Machines created Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, no of these companies worked, what the accusation explains by the fact that they didn't get work.
It serves even of these companies, as at the request of Master Zsolt Santen, and the editor of the funding actions of society, he established facts in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuskat, such as Atlas and Y-General associations.
Kubatov gave organisms, 15 factors totally issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the factures and the TVA would go to Kubatov's cup.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fixed factures used in the framework of the subvention request of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Association Y-generation and Testament in Modern Hungary has introduced a request for subvention to the public use organism of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mih√°ly Based (TMA).
They have obtained this subvention for a total of $500,000 HUF two times, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives indicated in the request.
To abuse that it does not know, five physical factures received from the Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Furthermore, these facts have been found during the investigation made in the Office of Armaged Kemecs√≠, in the Ministry of Education.
In the audience, one part of the accused will report the method of manufacture of factures, as she had already done before the park.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accusation, John Zuszett himself, decided to raise the ball over the whole story.
Before now, his grandfathers are not very detailed, and although he promised many times to tell the details, he has not yet done it.
The question is to know whether it is in its interest, or then, at least, the socialists would have concluded an agreement in which the rebuilding of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would only take the chapter.
Today, this last will probably be watched, since the requests for its place in surveyed residence, based on a allocation of its detention conditions, continually fall into the ear of a sudden.
While those who have caused so much more important sufferings, and the authors of non-reparable economic delays are freely or at least waiting for their own homes the end of the procedure, and he does not have this opportunity.
The surgence psychology: Why do we spend more money?
In the ventures of the reachers, the purchasers have the opportunity to depend more, and to surprise the market.
Neurological and economic researchers in New York have successfully updated the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
Following their studies published in the Science Revision, human beings do not want to be far from this type of competition, such as a sale to eBay, and so they also want to pay a pretty high price.
These researchs tried to draw a neurological scheme of this type of "jou" with the sales to experimental achievements.
One of the volunteers groups played a lot, while the other group took part of a sale to the games, while helping a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analysed the active cerebral areas of experimental subjects.
In the two games, the participants could win the money, but during the sale of the gains which an essential element is the surface of a third, the whole belonged under the brain, called strriatum, was moved in intensive way when the part loss.
This part of the brain, nearly many other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the mount of prices is explained with the escape before the violent reaction of the stream.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this researcher group continued financial monitoring analysis.
Three groups were in various circumstances in respect of a partner.
They have just informed the control group of the real value of the product concerned, and they did so.
In another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win from the party, they would receive 15 additional dollars in reward.
While the third group received him those 15 dollars before the ends, but the members of the group were also lost this money, in case they lost the feeds.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the accent was set at one on the victory, while at the other, on the escape.
In the meaning of the hypothesis of the neurologues, the members of the player team were prepared to higher actions than those conducted by the control group and the group "for the victory".
"This results cannot be shown by no existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomenon consists of investments only by the pleasure of winning and paradise before the risk.
Only the neurological image methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theory in moveing, now, on a third explain." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the faculty of economic sciences in the University of New York.
The hepatitis: When do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half billion people suffer the hepatitis B or C chronic, while in Hungary, the chronic disease of the fuel is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated to hundred thousands of the porters of the virus of the hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven thousands follow a treatment. This is because often the diseases don't know that they are portors of the virus.
Hepatite denomination is a generic name given to infections touching the fuel and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of feed and joints are characteristics, but the pathogene agents and disease are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogene genes, are mainly propagated under two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g.: food or consumed water), the hepatitis B, C, D and the other virus by blood and organic liquids (sperme, vaginal secrecy, self).
For travellers, it is usually recommended to make vaccin against virus A and B. There is no vaccin against C.
The symptoms of the hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption of consumption.
Then it develops on the hair and on the white eye a visible jaunce, the seals become clearer, and the urine takes a more fountained color. The health can take two to three weeks.
Over the world, each year, a million of people die from the most serious form of this patology, such as the cancer or the cyrhose of the hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimations, only one of 10 diseases receive a medical treatment.
Hepatite C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to a surrounding or a smoke cancer.
Most of the diseases do not know about the virus, because the pathogene gene disturbs the cells of fuel. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, precognised prevention is very important, as well as regular depth tests.
The pollution is much higher than the average of a population of three groups: people who have raised blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million diseases are achieved from a chronic type C hepatitis in the world.
Since the disease may be detected by a running test in laboratory, it is recommended to consult his doctor treatment since the observation of unknown origin symptoms.
The disease may be healthy if it is detected at time. The virus can be equipped from the organism, so the risk of deterioration is lost and the development of a cancer has been prevented.
The 30 September is the world's day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by organs representing diseases of the four corners of the world.
His goal is to attract the attention on the cronical smoke surrounding, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of the pre-diagnostic diagnostic of the disease.
Does he who believes in God feel less of pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious faith would work as a kind of analgesic, which had already contributed to the death of Catholic martyres.
The British Telegraph‚Äôs day published a article according to which researchers of Oxford University have made an interesting experience in analysing what level God‚Äôs faith could influence the tolerance to the pain of human being.
In the framework of this experience for the less strange, 12 Catholic faiths and so many attitudes have been submitted to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Vierge Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were capable of exclude a large part of suffering.
With a human brain palpation technology, we also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, in which acad√©micians, scientists, philosophy and theologists participate from various university sectors.
Further precisely, the experience is deployed by the following way: a instrument that emits skins and divorces electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
Researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two peninsulas, one as the Vierge Mary penetrated by Sassoferrato at the 17th century and the second, the lady to hermine punished by Leonard de Vinci at the 15th century.
Researchers in the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Vierge Mary declares a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, brought on its aimful effect.
Experimental subjects have passed a half-hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, 20 electrochocs in four parts have succeeded, although it is a religious threat, or the most general subject.
The Catholics stated that at the view of the Vierge Mary, they felt as "security" as a person who's "to take care" and they're "calm, and the peace has invaded them."
In view of the religious thematic pain, they have considered 12% of pain in less than when they looked at the work of Leonard.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part of the experience, thinks that it can get the same effects with any other strong image, in the athies, to find the appropriate photo.
"We should find a face image to which they are very positive, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, the English exhibition, welcomed the results of these researches.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, is it not more than the question of knowing what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if it shows the believers a Madone punished by Leonard or by a piece of the same calibration?
Would the view of a Vierge Marie's best quality offer better results?
You're what you're talking about.
In the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google shows that we can find it on the bottom of people in the same title as the sky above their head. He knows where they have passed their vacances, what specialists they consult and what their interest centres.
However, it is not enough, by Eric Schmidt, which is one of the influenced persons of the society.
While the sceptics establishing a parallel vision of Orwell's horror, these are not just seen the essential of the site 2.0.
Eric Schmidt stated, in the Financial Times, that Google's main ambition is to collect more information on its users. This is necessary for Google Foundations to respect their initial objective that sounds as follows: "Let us in a system all the information of the world!".
After the manager of Google, after ten years of a global chambering work, they are always at the beginning of their objectives to handle all the information.
At the question: What's going on five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that would be best for me?" But the software will not answer this kind of question, simplely at first view, that the day when they will get enough on users.
It is not perfectly clear for all internals but the words used during Internet search, the IP address of the computer that starts search and the visited pages later by interested persons are exactly reflected.
With the personalized search program two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have searched, on what they have clicked. This is, long term, recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide more personal answers, and we will submit products and services based on our previous statements and preferences.
What happens if someone serves my data against me, if he looks at what my work is? they ask users, who's worried to see the Google information monopole.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society who can exceed fear, and it is not the fear of punishment, the desire of freedom, or even the revolving against the power that can suffer against the internal reaction.
However, it is a statement confirmed that the search terms are not only recorded, but in cases justified, they are transferred to a third, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of the internal.
The most sustainable example of these last times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedofiles, during which Google has transmitted to Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing an identification.
The comprehensive internals of person's rights could put a supply of supply in the last May, when Google, arms above with the EFF legal protection organization, proved his right to the FBI court. According to the jurisdiction made in the future, Google will not always be obtained by any point of the constitution to distribute information on the FBI secret request, any kind of nature.
(In the same time, the federal government had successfully received a few 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that he had reported in relation to the strength of the law on the protection of the child, voted several years before, but at the end, he did not succeed to procur the lists of private users, nor the full list of the Internet websites and the key words of these two last months.)
The Court of Google is therefore a lot contradict: it is fucked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate shirt and their private areas suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolution that is manifested against many national society of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savageons" with the passionists, the activities and the enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries in Google see the next generation of large enterprises, the "brand corporation" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogue as a winter of the world because of Windows, and even if both fight for the same goal.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, in contrast to Microsoft, does not ask his identification code users, don't ask money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, face the work of the official management of the software.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problem relationship between the rights of person and the Internet, and what is the web 2.0, the key word the most proclaimed of these last years, just behind him.
In fact, the web 2.0 does not matter anything else than cooperation, that is the fact that we are intend to leave traces behind us, and that we serve communicating channels set at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exhausted.
A young, generally, can have a profile on several public pages, from Facebook in Xanga, and can even release them to other offers, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can refer them to a continuous system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also have blogs, in which they appear automatically their recent photo galeries that they are stored on Frlick or Picasa.
While we can take aware of many examples, such as the little friend who includes easily the view of the photos of the morning, taken by the clock of common friends, with whom his unbelieving friend passed the evening, or the company who licensed one of his employees, nothing for the real opinions that he wrote on his top management blog, can be on one thing: the private life term is totally recognised of our days.
He who lives a online life is constituted of what he shows himself, and it is so that we can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of young people today.
He wants to hide something, or at least try to turn the Google monopole, can do it (for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, don't let any trace in mind).
The number of persons who, of course, do not register public pages to find them not to be able to find them, is not money. Google online services, through the text treatment of image treatment, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to large server parks and that does not gather our best profile, which exists until this day.
The public opinion waits, without really hiding it, the moment that Google will devote its real nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The public areas AdWords/AdSense deserves the number of public agencies, while the offers introduced to a faster speed of migrants are not only at Microsoft, but to many other Microsoft program creators.
However, critical observers, at the end of this, find contradictions with concernful effects: for example, the top management of the society rejected, in its entirety, the Protestations of the employees, after they duplicated the price of the business maternal, and after the society has judged the multiple day-day restauration, takes any time. All this seems to be arising at the fact that it has already been in 2006, Google was achieved before the Chinese government and after the terms of their agreement, the society detected all the benefits of the good governance, as well as the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of the society, new services are not only announced when they can be used. This is only in the next months and next years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the scan and archive project of books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the company will at least find the Supreme Court of the United States, other threat before his Health system, because in that, we can build a medical property from the results of our ancient analysis, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google mounts a genetic database can give a good material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The Room of the Scientific Cory Doctorow, written with half orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be closed by exploiting nothing but through the Google data.
Two minors helped to disappear the traces of the double killer of Ozd
"The police invited two miners to ask them in the case of Ozd's dual murder. After the based supply, they helped to lose the crime traces." - the port of the Commissary Department of Borsod.
Youths have recognized the facts that they are approached, and now they are accused of complication.
The two minors, which, according to the information of MTI (Hongroise Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, are freely defending themselves.
The complication of murder may enter a detention in order to go to 5 years.
The suspect of the dual killer of Ozd, a young man of the 23-year-year-old, was placed in provisional detention, Sunday.
Leaders of accusation retained against him are multiple murders, committed with premediation and interest.
During the investigation, he declared that the young man of 23 years had a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to regulate his debt, and that's why he's attracted his creative, last Friday, on a site of Ozd, where he killed him, and the little daughter of this man, 9 years old.
According to the information of the MTI, the young man predicted his crime. The weapons with which he was going to make his hidden crimes on crimes are the evidence.
The police examines the weapons and circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Varsovie Bullshit makes a proposal for the rating of Prague's bullshit
Warsovie's value bourse proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion of Cheques core, for the rating of 100% of the Bourse Action Package of Prague values.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warsovie's bourse, confirmed this proposal that the Polands had done, although the Chess had been excluded the Varsovie's bourse of the new potential properties of Prague.
The cause of this exclusion is that Varsovie's bourse is in the hands of the State.
99% of actions are in the hands of the Poland State who wants to separate more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activities.
According to the Chec E15 Economic Day, the proposal of the Poland represents the highest offer that has been made until now for the ransom of Prague's bourse.
According to the Czech Press, the Vienna's bourse, the transatlantic bourse Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, London and Deutsche B√∂rse offered a offer until this day.
Peter Koblic, the director of Prague's bourse, stated the last week that the new owner of Varsovie would be among the interested ones, and did not exclude the fact that it could cause the loss of Prague's bourse in the future.
The value of the Bourse of Prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Chinese corners by the specialists of the market.
On the basis of a agreement between actioners, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important property of the Prague bourse is the investment bank of Patria Finance, with about 25 per cent of participation, followed by 14,7 per cent of the Bank Ceska Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.l. with 13,5 per cent.
The financial crisis of the viewpoint of the European Press
In their comments on the March dedicated to the international financial crisis, attempt to day, the leaders of the European press are already called a "second 11 September".
"Global Financial Catastrophe, we have to have the President of America" - accuses the day of Rome, the Republic. "The President has not even been able to block with his own part a law proposal, improvised to the vacuum, intended to bring salvation to a disappearable situation..."
In the place of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionary Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September.
A part of the madrilen press is also seeing the emissary bow in Washington.
According to the vision of the Day of El World, these are the missing of the political direction of there, which has brought the world's economy to the border of the flow.
The risk of the achievement of the American financial system increased every day, and the whole world will pay the strong price.
The Bush plan was far from being perfect, however, according to the vote of the Congress, a real danger, which Washington does not propose political tool to treat the crisis.
The world's economy is empty, just when the capitalism history has been one of the greatest transformations.
We can't ignore the most longer threat - subline the Geneva's Day-Anzeater.
Some states can still have a safeguard bow to their financial organisations, and by the money of their contributions, they can save them from failure.
Certainly, if there are more banks in such domains, then neither financial measures nor new improvings will be sufficient.
In long term, we need the states of the European Union to make a few cases of their national egoism and to center the control above the distributed financial markets.
Nothing that lunch, the financial organisations have received more than 100 billion euros - has mentioned the wine day, Der Standard, which adds that the fears of which the European contributions also will also have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, like the Americans in order to meditate in the crisis, become more realistic.
Before this, the EU is not really busy of the crisis, which, as a tsunami, through, partly, the old continent.
"Saveers" should not mark at the same time a hundred billion euros, in contrast, if they would notice in what case it would be racial to touch the money of contributions, with the objective of preventing greater disagreements.
The smart car follows the bourdon flight
What method would be better to develop appetite technologies to avoid obstacle, if it is the imitation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
For example, the babies.
In the wonderful project presented in the CEATEC, having been in Japan, the bourdoners have given the strategic idea to Nissan engineers to inspire them in the way they should conceal the next generation of obstacles.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, an auto-robotized bio-inspired order system, type BR23C, which has equipped the qualities of the babies, the final objective is to encourage the implementation of a system capable to escape all obstacles.
In its flights, each abeil constitutes its own space, an oil form, which actually looks like our safe protection cock - explained, during the exposition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the Director of the Department of research and development and technological public relations.
The eye of the shoes plays a primary role, because it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
In order to imitate the eye functions, the engineers have attached the idea of the telemeter to laser.
This identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, it assesss the distances and sends a signal to the front microprocessor, which transforms it in an evacuation operation.
The perception of the obstacle is in a second fraction. Then, the mini robot car, following the movements of the ball, change immediately the direction of its roads in turning a sufficient angle to disappear collision.
In contrast to all existing systems, this evacuation manufacturer is completely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the mini robot could not react enough quickly to disappear the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctive and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable layer and the most internal of the protection carrier, a layer where the collision is now inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the beauty did to avoid the other beauty.
The process must be disappeared in an eye clinic.
In the opposite of the beauty, the difference cannot go to high, bottom or diagonal, it can only be two sizes, and only in the direction where routes can turn.
In this way, instead of infinite combinations that have the balls to lose other balls, in our case, only the rotative movement, the acceleration and the rallency as maintainers of the mini auto-root
The BR23C uses Lithium polym√®re battery that are less and which the energy concentration is greater, which makes their longer life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligence instinctive reaction that is primarily, not the data treatment, and even less the capacity to store.
This mechanism should only treat some signs entering by second, and react to these.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of the previous manufacturers. In this way, it only uses a few kilo-bytes of memory continued.
We don't need memory of a giga-bytes capacity, nor even byta-bytes.
This is the first step to the concept of a technology serving to the instant evitation. According to Nissan's estimations, this system will make its income in the series of cars produced in the next ten years.
Another application may be its integration in the GPS satellite navigation system, so that he can lead the driver to his destination by disappearing the obstacles on his path.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The version of the Economic Safety Plan of 700 billion dollars is written, in order to recover the credits of the bank, and to use several times, is ready.
On the first tour, half of this sum will be expensed.
Reuters announce that during the new discussions to the next week, Saturday, the local hour of the Coast is, the leaders of the Congress have been agreed on existing discussions since days and days, around the safeguard plan of 700 billion dollars.
"We have done a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American Chamber of representatives, after which it remains more than to put the agreements on paper.
The commitment, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates to the President, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The American Secretary-General in Trezor, Henry Paulson, stated that the commitment results that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must still be implemented. After Pelosi, there is no question about Wall Street's salvation, but to turn the economy's routes into the other sense.
The written version of the plan has been published before the opening of Asian markets, evening at 20h, local hours from Washington (in the morning at 2:00, according to the local hour of Central Europe), but it has not been offered to spectacular mount in the bowls.
Monday, the room of the representatives will be the first to vote to the proposal of the law responsible for the name of the Economic Stabilisation of Urgent 2008, and then its success will be between the Senat's hands.
Saturday, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also held the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the advanced advanced this night, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to establish our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the port of the Blanche House.
Furthermore, the divergence programme of the initial proposal made by Bush Administration, which mentioned that 700 billion dollars should be expensed at one time, for the rating of the titles on debt credits.
The first half of the total of 700 billion can be expensed. The first 250 billion will be delivered immediately after the law was adopted by the Congress, probably lunch. This first sum will serve the Secretary of the Tresor to buy certain credits of the bank, while the use of the $100 billion additional will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be monitored by an independent body in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In terms of the law, the secretariat in the Tresor may place a combined strategy: it may, at the same time, buy duplicate credits, titles on hypothecs and double hypothecs, and other types of "toxic credits".
The competent persons of the Ministry have stated that the rackets may have been in the framework of a sale to the investments, but also directly.
The rule provides the possibility for the companies concerned to take part in a security programme, where the Secretariat in the Treaty guarantees the tools for the origin of concerns, for which the enterprises have paid an equivalent price to the provisions.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to save 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it would be a wide rating of detailed credits, their assurement, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system intended to achieve the resource of one or another important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions, to be ready to apply the law while it is signed" - he added.
In addition, bank leaders who are in bad posts and waiting for the aid of the State may expect that their department indemnities, who are just called for the outside Atlantic, will be placed by the Government.
The salary planning is not only mentioned in precise cases. In addition, the limits depend on the way the secretariat in the Tresor proposes its assistance to the company.
The principle of the platform means that if the secretariat in the Tresor is reached in the framework of a sale to the staff, they will exceed a surface on the double parachute, less than the president of Discredibility Bank part of the retraite.
Directly after the rating of certain credits, the Government will be an aggressive way to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders will not be exaggerated.
In order to complete the image, even to add that existing painted parachutes are not modified. The platform is only the new contracts, this is to motivate the participation to the plan.
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal plannings will be enforced on the advantages of the general directors - commented the President of the Commission on the support of the financial prestations of the Deputy Chamber, Democratic Barney Frank.
Moreover, the State provides a right to buy parts in banks to take part in the plan, and the risk of contributions is reduced, because they can even be gained in the case when economic and with it saved banks will return on their pattes.
The proposal for the Law to be mentioned in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to the Congress, which will put on the way the losses will be restored to the contributions from the financial sector.
On both sides, there was clearly those who expressed their doubts in relation to this plan.
This is not why the American citizens have sent us, this does not protect the dollars of contributions - stated the Republican Deputy of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic College of Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that it's the same that they take the measures, as the responsible for Wall Street's exploitation.

Barack Obama and McCain support both the bank saving plan
Wednesday, Barack Obama as John McCain, candidates in the presidency of the two major American parties, have ensized their support for the government's safeguard plan of 700 billion dollars. However, there are politicians who require the demission of the American Secretary-General to Tresor.
After marathons negotiations that have been during days and days, the representatives of the Congress and the Administration have finally announced, on Sunday, that they have concluded principle agreements on the bank safeguard plan.
This financing plan, for the purpose of the degree of Wall Street Crisis and the paralysed credit market, became the central question of the Presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain are even present, each one as more appetite than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the recent summers, with the implementation of economic issues, Obama has succeeded again to search for a bit of progress. The advance of McCain, with the name of Sarah Palin, was founded as a collistary just after the Republic Convention.
At a campaign meeting held at Detroit, Sunday, Obama expressed his hope to see the Congress to vote quickly the law on the safe plan of 700 billion.
He submitted that the proposal contains the protection passments of consumers who also support him.
"It's now that you need to act with responsibility (...) a danger of your work, your economy, all industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy." He said before a population of 35,000 people.

The press review of the German language territory
The right camp is inact, it is only in the heart of the party that the electorers have become more wise - it is also called Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarois country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to stop coalition of red and black.
The speed (splay.de)
In the Internet editing of the German information magazine, Franz Walter analysed the causes of the CSU dramatic deficit in his article titled "The revolution in Bavi√®re devotes his fathers."
After this policy recognized, the CSU erosion began well before the crazy two Beckstein-Huber does not take its functions.
Christian socialists have transformed the Bavire for decades and now, these modern citizens that turn their dose.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all the Christian democracy, and in fact, Angela Mercer.
For the CSU, the failure was not actually a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was probably there, just ten years ago: the unexpectable hegenium of the national party has been completed.
This was 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was raised with 47.7%, and this was the first time since the fifty years, with a score below the level of 50%.
This has repeated three years ago in the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, it is the time of the so called Stoiber.
The cause may be impressed to modernization "devoting his parents" in the region consistently by the CSU.
This is 40 years ago that sociologists announce this, but they were strongly threatened about the ritme. However, secularization, education results and establishment of north Germans and east in the Bavi√®re region, they could not stay without consecution on the faithfulness of the CSU electors.
A modernization will be paid with the increase of opportunities, and the consequences of such policy are also visible.
The right camp is inact, it is only within the party that electorers have become more wise, critical and more entire.
It is also amazing that during these past weeks, it is just the classic citizens groups that have been far away from the CSU, such as independent, artists, bactic detenants and higher studies.
In these groups, the support of the CSU was low to 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
In its article, "Who with? With who? The President of the Parties are on the reservation of the issues of coalition," the Australian conservator day is concerned about the situation of the confusioned internal policy which has been installed after the Australian elections.
The other socialists of the SP√ñ wanted to discuss with the conservators of the OVP.
The OVP prohibited the SP√ñ to meet its internal affairs.
The BZ√ñ population party is open for negotiations, and the Green does not want to agree on coalition.
The elections have been located, now all turn around the coalition; in discussions organized on the public TV, the parties leaders are intend to put their cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SP√ñ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the OVP.
The SP√ñ wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is effectively possible - it is what already exists in some regions and socialist partnerships.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Moltrer, the current president of the OVP, as vice-chanclier, remains open from Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, Sch√ºssel-Moltzer's orientation was, in any case, rejected.
An answer of this combination is out of question.
Mutler reacted with preciousness to the proposals of red.
As he has already said, a cooperation will certainly be unfruitful if Faymann trys to impress himself in the internal businesses of the OVP.
In its part, the choice of opposition or input in coalition is currently a question openly. These points must be absolutely discussed within the OVP.
J√∂rg Haider, President of the BZ√ñ, shows it again to all proposals.
"To abuse the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Jaroka said: "The circle of the poverty and the collection must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Sommet for Equality of Chance, which is the Hospital of France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message listed before the plenary assembly, as one of the main portals of the expert consultation, Livia Yaroka, European Deputy Fidesz Popular Party in Europe, has taken attention to the assemblies in education, because it is a violation of the right that touches the most rooms children, and that is one of the principal franks to success in their life.
In the name of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened from a part by Xavier Bertrand, French Ministry of Working and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner of the Working, Social Affairs, and the equality of opportunities.
The European social partners, as well as the most important representatives of law protection and European civil organisations, are in the area of equality of opportunities.
According to Mr Fidesz Popular Party, Jaroka prevented that the rooms are lost from the work market, first, after their low quality.
"A surprising majority of young rooms has no secondary diplomas, and consequences of a elementary education of bad quality, only an infinite part has the possibility of getting a higher study diploma."
In addition, Jaroka insisted that education as a fundamental right to be human being plays a key role when we have to assess other fundamental rights.
Investment in the previous education of Rome Children means a strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Deputy, it is necessary to take awareness of these reports in a largest possible circle, also between rooms and non-rounds.
In fact, a rom child begins the school, and increases its chances to become a productive member of the work market; by the payments paid from its income and its consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"For their nationality of the European Union, the Roms must be ensuring their right to quality education and to be protected from a lower quality and sector education." - sublineed Livia Jaroka.
Following the Deputy, a cooperation of the European Union to an objective and a action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the school degradation process, and the respect of existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is essential.
"The circle of poverty, collection and unemployment must be broken, and the possibilities that the democracy has to be able to participate as a full right citizen in the future of Europe" required Yaroka.
In the name of the "European Year for Equality of Chances" for all, the objective of the Summary for the equality of opportunities in Europe each year from Berlin in the last year is to ensure a unique platform to support the measures taken for the equality of opportunities and for the fight against discrimination, referred to at the European level and at the level of Member States.
CSU: grace for a transition period
It's on October that the decision will be taken on the outcome of the two Huber-Beckstein
Despite this pitoyable electoral failure, the heads are not yet covered, and the debate on personal issues in the Bavarois CSU has been updated.
The President of the Partie, Erwin Hube and the governor of the Regional Government, G√ºnther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is to know until when the grace is long?
The exit of the tandem, when a catastrophic voice loss of 17 per cent, will be at the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this very critical couple have, in any case, feel that they were not particularly in their seat.
In this regard, they were employed to appreciate the broken members of the fraction and base, which a day after the "tsunami bavarois" required personal consequences for the loss of absolute majority.
There are five years ago - it's true, yet under Edmund Stoiber's direction, at the top of his carrier - the socio- Christian unit was 60,7 per cent, while today, a year after the puzzle against Stoiber, it remains only 43,4 per cent of their strength.
During 46 years, the CSU was the only "sovereign" of the Bavi√®re's 18 percent of the German PIB.
But the conservators are still strong in this southern region, key importance for Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be confronted to coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reamendment of the Partie, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible follower of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which starts discussions with the FDP library, and with the Libers Electors, formed the length of the right values, for an event of coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange nest of the destination was that through the list of Liber Electors, in the law of Gabriel Pauli, whose measure against Stroiber has served the possibility of push perpetrated by the two Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitional municipal policy.
Now, the CSU leaders make all their energy to stabilize, in one or another way, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has taken the fishery in the collisions, will also receive a active role. The ancient ruler of the Regional and Ex-President of the CSU, designed on 28 September as the most loved day of his political carrier.
Monday, Huber started a few notes to the CDU. After him, they would have much more support from the part of the brother's part.
Other CSU policies interpreted the disface as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the elections of Bundestag, which will be placed in September 2009, Mercel will not be a chance again, but if they are on a way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, when it is difficult to hide its deception caused by the phase, the loss of the CSU will not affect the great coalition of Berlin.
The matter is, however, because it will not be easier to control the violated CSU, and the crisis of socio-demokrats is always hard.
Since 1946, the SPD has obtained its worst results with 18,6 per cent in Bavi√®re.
Lukasenko - its rows : 110 - 0
No deputy of the opposition has been accessed to the Bielorus Parliament after lunch elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country guided by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its property and stability, while after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the destruction of votes.
The OSCE, sending 450 observators of 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation composed of 110 persons in this country of 10 million residents have been very well opposition since long-term elections before the elections of this day, the opposition with its forces under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would hope seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate for the fourth time in the two elections, on the amendment of the constitution in 2006, "will allow" this time the preciousness of some deputy of the opposition to the Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ renewed his boycotte in the origin.
The fact that Bielorussia, depending economically and more in Russia, would like to improve its reports with the EU, where the Bielorustic Qualified Political Order of Anti-democratic, Lukashenko and many high-located policys have not received a visa of income, was one of the opposite. Bielorussia has taken a credit because of the reduction of Russian natural gas imports, still more, and thus contributed to the transition of the Beltransgaz society.
The fact that the OECD, during the evaluation of the campaign, achieved the achievement of positive changes instead of missing, such as the prohibition to present for a third of the candidates to the opposition, refers to a preliminary payment.
However, the Communication of the Monday OSCE had already been the campaign, while the essential of candidates in the opposition could not appear in medias, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be presented in the absence of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is also a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detentions have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confronting with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the South Osset and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which the Belarusse has made a conference on paper, consists of the two independent territorys since a month.
"We did two steps before, and one step behind, but the most important is that the dialogue has been carried out between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch to our journal.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the Presidency elections of 2006, it is desirable that it remains like this, although "the power has been afraid in this Parliament that has no ability to do even one contrast."
The opposition does not propose protestation actions in the view of results, but it is trying to reach its message on the need of economic reforms to the electorers.
"Obviously, we have a lot of doubt of this side: we have to print our opposite journals in Russia, local authorities put us bottles in the roads for the diffusion, but I can also constat that they are more to support the elections, even in the age circle," said Milinkevitch, refering to the fact that in the current regulation of Lukashenko, which consists of social security as its main result, the rate of the most of the sustainable resistance is not really approved as appropriate.
"Because the end of the country and the extent of the trade deficit, the exploitation of social security, "with the silence of a cimeter, is not more than one time question" - Milinkevitch.
In contrast to the policy of the opposition, Russian observators have qualified democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, leadering the mission of the Independent States, said to the Russian Press Agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe not in words but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only evidence of the maturity of bielorussy electors.
Brunetta: "After today, a little dinner before work."
In the history of the Chigi Palais, there were no turning doors for the entrance and the output of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is enforced against small males, against which he points and then drinks the coffee in the bar during the work hours.
The news has been presented today by the Ministry of the Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The touring doors tells Brunetta-- are a tool to work better, with more productiveness, more presences and more services."
Now begins a new section of responsibility and transparency.
"It's a reformism" sublines in addition to Brunetta.
The installation in all the establishments of the President of the Council is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of touring doors is even important of a symbolic view point.
No resistance from the part of the employees has been recorded, ensure the Secretary-General: "It's a process shared by the employees, and we have the cooperation of all."
Shortly, smaller dinner during work hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, who suspects in a dream, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 tomorrow is a beautiful and sale resolution."
By a Conference to the High School of Public Administration
of Rome, the Communist Minister that "in three months, the absence of disease of public employees was reduced by 50%, or 60 million workers in more than one year."
He adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration .
Italian, "with salary dynamics - explains the Ministry-- these 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and also inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees have been united to convince the standards of Brunetta decree which have been reviewed to Codacons.
"But the Ministry of the Public Function has today the data on the lowdown of the absentism on the workplace because of the disease-writers the association of consumers - the people of the "active favourites" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the Comprehensive and Product Public Administration were gathered together to declare the war to illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exception of additional locations in the case of disease for service; the length of the time of the employee's home permanence, during which control visits are conducted, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Ministry.
Accounts on the workplace, Napolitan: "Creative Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 work accidents, 3 dead and 27 people who remain unexpectedly.
In 2007, the Inal data confirm that the white dead were about 1,200.
Numbers that testify the gravity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and provoke nearly twice more death than murders.
To take attention to institutions, social forces and information methods on this dramatic aspect, the celebration Anmill today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of victims of accidents on work, institutionalised on the second Sunday of October.
"The careful data issued by Anmil, and the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the prevention on the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, when a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutil and invalid work, Peter Mercandelli.
The Governor of State expresss his "creaty approval for the continuous continuous effort for prevention on workplaces, protection of accidented workers, assistance to victims' family and sensibilisation of public opinion"
"Naturally indigated, everyone has broken the poing to put a term to such tragedys that, by their size, submit the media clamator and participation of public opinion, even if the day-day reality presents us dramatic cases, even repeatively in their dynamic.
Napolitano does not just hide that "It is sure a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
Many initiatives in the school sector are increasingly particularly important for a more direct consciousness of the young people who enter the work world.
It is our debt to keep attention to this phenomenon, not under evaluation of the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislation standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco room Fini has sublined how many" this phone of the white dead is a absolute social urgent, which insultes the conscience of each of us, and puts all institutions to make a concrete effort to make it quickly."
The data of accidents on the work seems to report a lower positive trend, but it does not exceed that the number of white dead is even impressive" has sublined the President of Anmil Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "tendance to rabbis" to be translated in a lower attention, because it's just when the attention is relaxed, which comes to tragedy.
"we believe that in general, we don't do enough to contrary the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We have submitted Mercandelli more controls and inspections, as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this from school."
- He added, "which must be further efforts in the context of communication and sensibilisation of public opinion.
"But in particular, there is a greater sense of responsibilities of the employees face a phenomenon representing a social urgency."
"Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the safeguard conditions provided for the victims of the work" and the "assistance to which the system is oriented in the last years."
"The objective, therefore, is to give to the worker the security guarantee ‚Äì has added-- so that the destination of those who have a accident should not depend on spontaneism or the extension of the legislator."
The MP3-lector pointed from the deck, they risk the audition.
Listen to the full volume music during a long period using portable music devices such as MP3 readers can cause permanent lessons at the audition.
This announces the European Commission, which, in a communication distributed in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the recent and recently identified health risks of the EU, published today.
"On this scientist report, we read in the note is that 5-10% of those who, at least 5 years, listen from music full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour and week, risks a permanent loss of auditive capacity."
"I'm worried about the fact that a very important number of young people who often use portable musical devices and mobile telephones full volume, can unconsciously disturb their audition in an unreparable way," say Meglena Kuneva.
"See the scientific data, the U.S. responsible is a clear risk and we must quickly react.
The most important is to sensibilisate consumers and to make these public area information.
We should also review the existing control systems seeing scientific opinion, so that they are fully efficient and can follow the new technologies."
Brussels asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem, see the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase of the number of young people exposed to the sound that they generated.
"The scientists conclude the Ue- Executive confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties , which measures could be adopted eventually to protect children and children, against the exposition of portable musical and similar equipment.
There is already a European Security standard that limits the low level of 100Db municipal devices, but more concerns about audits that could be excessive exposition to such sound sources.
It is possible to be limited to these data that make solutions such as reduction of levels and exposition period.
The Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable musical devices, who listen from the full volume music (play 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are currently exceeding the limits in force related to the maximum low level of work.
Those who listen from music in such conditions during long periods are risking a permanent loss of auditive capacity after five years.
This interests 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to the environments of 2,5 and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany gave the order to make the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March, we'll end, in June, we'll shoot the weights.
This is the calendar established by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale" which took place this morning at the new seat behind the Caracalla Thermes.
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will set the rules for Rome.
On March when they have finished, the Common Committee and the Council will evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategy Plan for Rome with the " official timber" of the Capitol and his Master Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented there, intended to submit Germany, it should propose ideas of the Rome development which will be used by the political decisions, which remain the Committee and the Council.
No roles oversight, but only the desire to have a coin where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, she will finish her tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a specific time.
In June, we will present the strategic plan of the work made by the Commission for the future of Rome of Capitale. "
For those who accused the Commission to be inutile, seeing that its opinions are not contrary, Germany replies: "All of the work that the Commission will be able to do, and of the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is, such as in France, as the Attali Commission, as otherwise in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be a fundamental contribution.
The policy is too often achieved by the management of the day and urgents that appear from time in time.
In contrast, we want to see before, and far away, to a deepest prospect, working seriously in Rome's development and its future."
In addition, Rome's master insists that "the Commission is not an inutile body or a bureaucratic assembly: it is absolutely free and will not cost an euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate the best intelligences that express the Capitol.
For Germany, "We need a strategy, not closer or immobile, to allow our city, to improve, whatever she has absolutely needed, while thinking about its future now a single spirit."
A future who, definite the Rome's master, "not will be limited to the common borders, but he will look far away" not only in the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and Mediterranean."
Obama? The first president of anti-American, that's why.
An American politician who takes to pass for independently, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in part of his decisions, destroyed the United States economy and had reports (as well as today, as private citizens) with Islam's enemy."
Attachments against Obama increase when the date of elections is close.
A lady of Miami wrote on a web site: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really crazy: he thinks he will win the highest function of a nation that is in all, two rulers and five black senators."
In fact, there are attacks that do not say a great thing; it is, of course, racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all electorers: Is it a good President? We also have the sondages, who say that Obama will win and with a good benefit.
In this case, it's still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A journal of the Mississipi, in the southern parts of the United States, wrote a article: Once in the vote box, we know who the American patriote will vote.
This is what aspects of the American mentality keeps secret until the end.
"Whatever you want, we will even see the cross, Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama won, we will go from the United States.
Choices never discovered until now, so that the success of the black candidate seems likely certain.
However, although all these reasons, the democratic card is George Bush.
It was asked to 1500 people: what were the Bush errors made during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America's change.
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 thousand soldiers and has been sent to her to feet.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost life, and the Americans have not been contradicted to make the valleys.
However, Iraq was, for most, the basic point of Bush.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a great tattoo to do.
Use, economic debt is even feeling in journalists: in pressure, it's the time of removements. And many accuses the Internet, this "assisting" of the journal paper.
Fifty hundred American journalists were interpreted by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimists today about their future.
However, they did not openly declare the information attachments, they feel less worried about confidentiality.
They don't feel isolated as before.
The problem of American journalists is the money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a destructive economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the removements made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work in the assembly of the journals are a big problem.
It's a problem that should be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if it wants that the traditional journalism like the great public hears it, it is not so reduced.
A most complex pessimism invaded American journalism.
Six on ten executive and journalists of printing journalists are convinced that the journalism at national level is going to follow a bad way.
Locally, the Executive Group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
The journalists don't have bad to see where the web goes.
The biggest editorial houses are traveling a travel to the Internet, persuaded by many as the killer of the journal paper.
The "economic pressure" that hears journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have adopted themselves to the technology that hoped she "to do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest approach in the American journalist is resident between the newsrooms -- the directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of the directors at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage is declined to 23%.
For some, it is linked to the "employment suffering".
Directors who think to lose their work position in three years are 47% at national level.
In regard to journalists, we're going to 30%.
The "security work" at staff level (in our editors, ndr) in America is still in the order of the day.
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract.
In a large nation like Us, with 300 million residents and thousands of journalists, reviews, radio, television and Internet, employees often offer what they want, and it becomes quickly a question to take or leave.
The directors have almost a large salary, while the editor can win 10 million dollars per month, except the retreat and the payment of security.
With regard to vacation, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, to 15 days, past a few years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists often are "mals" during the year.
That's the fault of climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE TO GROTTAFERRATE.
The President of the Second Penal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the immobilier agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankrote in the framework of the instruction on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
During the process on his charge, last week, he had received the establishment of home liberty transformed in a obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the immobilier agent could travel the trait of the province in a room in the capital.
According to the Court, such movements (which the pm has not agreed) would allow him to influence his society and to access evidence that accuses it.
Elliots in danger.
The phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago, with the vote of the Representative Chamber, contrary to the saving plan of 700 billion dollars approved by the White House: a very significant number of Americans was, and it is still more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is well the New York Times of yesterday, which confirms us that the current crisis is divided by the Republic Party, even more shared between its vital soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, in contrast, conservative, hostile to the "the people of Washington" and the world of the financial, powerful over in the Centre and South States.
The soul, just, who has been feeling despotic with the vote I've spoken to you at the beginning.
However, what comes to be citated is only a example of changes, big changes but the economic trembling in the current or well leaves to run: not only in the United States, but in the entire west, and may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomenon covered since a few years, so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal.
The first of these phenomenons is the rehabilitation, the extraordinary relationship, of the double sub-State category, in relation to a kind of re-enerationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of financial institutions which, of course, have extra relations with the foreign, but, before all, are involved in large scale, the billion of persons and families living in one solo country.
This creates immediately a political problem for the Government: it is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are more electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economicly, but politically, it is almost only national here.
The political internationalisation seems really out of game or well, there is no great thing to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union which, as usually shared, between various interests and the various national strategies, is not possible to decide any common policy line.
It is therefore the Government of each State that all expect interventions, rescue and relationship plans, new rules, and especially a lot of credits: when a difficult period, the States who have economic resources, the massage of financial resources can try to restore things in place.
They also have the necessary measures and legislation to use them: two resources of an inestimable value, elements which no international market or international organization can never be available in analog way.
This new impact of the state-nation crisis is the rest of perfect harmonised with the most important importance of the most recent economic developments in the economy to contribute to a sufficient factor related to this element: territoriality.
. In fact, while we were convinced that we were then entered into the Kingdom of the network, the most sophisticated technology, the non-materiale, convinced that globalised funds were now designed to dominate the world, we were considered a couple of one, that our future should always be able to regulate its accounts with the lower material things such as water, collection, petrole.
Some things that may certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscripted space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, there is certainly more cards than those who are not, that is, who has the fault to live in a place without collecting, without petrole and without water.
I now come to the second news that, however, provides a fracture.
Who says the Territory, the State, the Government, inevitably said political, and then Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomenones.
In one case, the consciousness of the need for authorised leadership, the research of a person who can take the situation handmaid.
On the other hand, a discredit vague for existing leaderships, economic species that have been discovered inadequate and full of shadow areas.
In addition, something more deeply, in a certain sense, even worried: a discredit, a suffering, an ideal image, a feeling of disagreement that has to imply the whole class of directors in a growing number of West countries.
So further increases the conviction of various classs, before the actions are the same ideas of social elections until now to their support, their way to hear and to be their culture in the complex term accepting, to have the same time, and to be more stranger in the opinions of most people.
In short, the request of leadership, the summerly food, a powerful and frameworked movement of delegations of leadership classs and traditional political orders, which appear in the "improvised" electoral revolutions, or well, in the changes of collective humors of these last time, from the conservative assessment in Austria Bavi√®re, to the challenge of workists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressists against Bush (and it would be well that the victory of the right in Italia has not been achieved).
There is the impression that traditional electors, their parts, their programmes, but also their resources, their journals, their credit intellectuals, their format, somebody seems to be still more difficult, what does not give up today, understand and therefore represent the deep layers of the West society, and that the economic crisis is strengthened, increased, and acting potentially in decreasing way.
In view of all this, talking about a current "rebellion of mass" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep the eyes open, that's not reasonable.
The supercolumn to walk on the walls.
Write the laws of gravity through a super cold and, in the future, walk on the parases such as Spiderman.
This is the objective of several American research centres, and today, a team of four institutions has almost success.
With an adhesif measured at a dose of 2,5 square centimeters, researchers had successful to maintain a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical park.
ETUDE- The American Review of Science has published the inventors of some researchers of the University of Dayton, Acron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the researcher team, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano tubes of carbon.
"The principle of the college can be imagined as a series of tubes available as a spaghetti ball." Explain Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by geckos pattes, microscopical pools that allow to ensure animals, a perfect adherent.
The tests made on various materials, such as the vision, the Teflon, and the vision paper, showed that the new adhesif is ten times more powerful than the pattes of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it's easily detailed from the paroi" explains Liming Dai, searching for the University of Dayton.
MARCHER SUR THE MURS? ‚Äì" this material could be used as temporary adhesif" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the parables such as Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers think about a lot of more fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, seeing carbon tubes are carbon drivers and electronic currency.
Other applications may be concerned with the aircraft engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
AUTRE RECHERCHE- The University of Berkeley, in California, she also wants to search for a new adhesif.
In an article of the American Chemical Society of America, California researchers presented a microfibrary shape as hairs, which carried out the pools during the movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruits.
Attention to the juice of plot, orange and pomegranate.
These drinks, especially consumed by desalerants and riches in vitamines, when associated with some living medicines, increased or reducing their efficiency, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, teacher of the University of Western Ontario in London, reminds the risks of fruits which they are, in wood or free, if associated with the ingest of certain medicines; during 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in the field of Philadelphia, a new warning: it is sufficient to reduce a jurisdiction of pampleusness, orange and pomes to reduce the absorption of certain live medicines.
Pamplemous juice has already been criticized because it has been responsible to increase the effects of certain aritmical, antibiotics, antibiotics, anxiolytics, staminal and neurological anti-stations, until toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS A RISQUE- This is the Italian Agency of the Medicine itself, which had given the new in a data bill of two years, warning doctors and patients to not assess the risk of this mix and to be careful of what it drinks, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methodone.
PAMPLEMOUSSE - According to experts, even the orange and pomme juice contains substances inhibitive medicines.
Long is the list of active principles imposed by the fulfillment and other juices.
From there, the calling of Michele Carruba, Director of the Public Pharmacology University of Milan: "These detections are in general, immediately signed to various national and international medical agents that will need, change the information notes of medicines.
It always needs to read the illustrative documents of the medicines that we take, and, if something is not clear, don't make impressed, but clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacian," sublined the expert to Ansa agent.
Paul Krugman's Economy Nobel.
The Nobel Economic Price was assigned to the American Paul Krugman for its research on trade models and location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Kenesian who teachs Princeton University and is also a festival editorial in New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critical criteria of the solutions in foreign economic and policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attention of September 2001, during the days of Enron's failure, Krugman wrote in a new article published on the New York Times, that the second event would be more determined than the first, in terms of consecutions on the history of the United States.
A prevention that deceives many polymees, and that has been approached to the economist for years, but it has now been revealed exactly.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked from the speed with which the memories of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom, have lost from the attention of the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "grande value economist", but also a very aggressive distributor, particularly critical to the excess of the Bush administration library.
Open Office, this is the third edit of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the next open source of personal productivity that is to touch still and more users, from the house to the office, professionals to the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the most favourable Microsoft Office.
Following a work of nearly a year, implemented by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows a large public with several new news: from the screen of welcome, and the interface becomes less austral, to other important, such as compatibility for the Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Open Office has particularly focused on interaction with the Office 2007 following, and it is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
So interesting, some specific functions for some modules, such as that allows to reduce PowerPoint presentations sizes, useful for example to send them by email or to import PDF files into the graphical design module, keeping the original view of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "PDF hybrides" documents that join the typical Adobe format graphical to the elements of a calculation sheet or a text designer.
The cooperation between several persons is a element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, various users can interfere with conflicts on the changes, in the development of texts, because each collaborator has a color of comments for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also in training to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they should have to explane the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable to the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that was found on the viewer since Friday.
Further than Windows and Mac OS, the following is as usual available, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to home or on the workplace.
And if the theme of freedom may be a way to divorce it in houses, it is just in the business, that Open Office then trys the great deficit, which already can count on various projects made in public administration and schools.
Without account of realities offering a training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium businesses, which could also be opened to business prospects.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent video of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations;Dbase, such as the cell Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Objective for 2008, achieved to 5 million of downloads, and considering that today are at least 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the output of the new version, we can even exceed the preceding number.
Cohl is also positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, whose third quality, and winning from the maillot of the best gripped.
This is the site of the day The Team that reports the news.
At 26ans, Cohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, they are also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood analysis on Cohl tests are part of these last weeks, by Lausane and Chatenay-Malabry labs.
If the anti-analyses confirm the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and must be forced to exceed two years of elimination.
The news of the Positivity of Kohl at Epo of Third Generation, was confirmed by the chief of the French antidoping agent, Peter Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, had notified the positivity to the Australian authorities.
The Australian of 26ans placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, taking up the maillot on the best wine.
IMAGES: NEW YORK TIMES OF THE ITALIE is RECHIST?
The Italian "come the countries of emigrants have recently been transformed in a privileged destination for immigrants" with reticence.
Does this become the Beau country in a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times has interested in a long article discussing the theme in Italy, from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating from Burkina Faso, killed the last month in Milan, so that he had robbed a biscuit box.
This case indicates what the New York Times defines as the "North Paradox": the North regions are at the time where it is recorded" more integration and more work," but also "the strongest anti-immigrated feelings in the country and the most important support in the North Lega"
In order to confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT also refers to Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation that Lega wants to raise immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestiness, it is citated as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendance underlined by the Pape and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, when he met Benoit XVI in Quirinal, asked what the State and the Church work together to win racism."
Students of dear lovers, to 900 euros for a room.
The market of locations for students did not know the crisis
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the syndicate of lots, a simple room can cost a student, to 900 euros in Milan, 700 to Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has now obtained very serious aspects to exclude all the categories of young people, the right to study because of the very high global costs that the families of provenance must support - explain the responsibility of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani in these cities, the strong request of the students has so deformed the market that a generalised increase process has been loved for residents.
In most cases, location offers also include a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistred, without lower limits, sublocations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions by the period of revision of the fiscal imposition are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading the research in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, we need to be about 450 euros; for a simple room, we go to 650 euros (Face Black zone), a average value of 800 (Lambite, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria)
In Florence, an average bed, 350/400 euros, a room at about 700 euros.
In Bolonia, where students concentrate in the near University areas, 250/280 euros need to be a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the nearest areas of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bol√≥na), we are requested about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
Fairly low values (550 euros for a single) for the nearby areas of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
It can only be economised in the device areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple area in Predestina, centocle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed, it is required 300/400 euros for a single, to 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinic areas, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, we need to count at least 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In the smallest cities, the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater importance in the citizen economy.
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, where the locations often are taken by extra Community students, are recorded a further anomalia: the law requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% in relation to the Italian applied.
By the old Cinema Paradiso, the cities excited the historical salts.
Historical cinematical salts are held for Multiplex.
"A cities without cinema salaries is an awful city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Joseph Tornator in the scene, explains well what is happening in the large towns of Italy, but also in the cities of the provinces,
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, with the born of large multisale, and the death of consumption of mono sals in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appears to us inelectual and incontable; he has more all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, it is often historical and loaded memory sites, "it's like one of my friends lost, someone who knows, with whom we shared a road and so many emotions" observes the meter in the scene of the New Cinema Paradiso, film offering to Tornator 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Price of the Jury of Cannes, and who tells the pocket of a province, and our talent of a way of life of the citizen, can be perdued forever.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main association of the tradeholders, mean: these five last years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the sales of the main cities that are especially paying the prices: 10 of less than to Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bolone and Rome, 6 in Turin, 5 in Palerme.
In the most touched regions, Roman Emilia is headed with 82 lost mono sals, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardie (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsibility of their disagreement is the event of multiplex, because it is well the three Italian regions which have recorded the most recent multisale cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia these last five years, 81 in Toscane as Emilia-Romania.
"Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way" observes Paul Protti, President of the Anec, "It is useful to build new structures, but it would also have to guarantee the survey of those already existing, because when a room is closed in a city, these frequencies are not all forced to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the deliveration of the credit for tradeholders: the ancient rate of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is horrible that the Government does not respect the existing laws in an ethical and moral view.
In order to support the sector, it would need between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
We note the case of Bol√≥n, the first Italian town, who, in concern of these closets, decided to resolve the situation through the signature of a protocol between Mayria and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to defend and promote the mono salaries of historical centres and equipment.
There are measures of fiscal facilities for managers and benefits for the public in mobilit√©: spectaculars may enter the limited circulation area, and they will have special tariffs for statistics and certain parkings.
"It's a initiative I please" observes Joseph Tornator, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bol√≥n, which makes other measures.
However, it is clear that, in order to contrary the super power of multiplex, traditional salles should also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public of today is more required.
The defence of the traditional cinema is a threat that is always important for me: the closement of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the one who convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I thought since 10 years ago.
I lived in Rome since 25 years ago, and when I passed before the Rialto, or the Querinal of Via National, then closed, where I have so much shared emotions, I turned from the other side to not see the black pannels through the pool.
Relations between political and ‚Äòand ranheta‚Äô, Joia Tauro's master arrested.
"The Maior of Gioia Tauro was prepared to uniform the elections of Mairia to the interests of the Piromalli Clan."
of severe accusations are launched by the Leaders of the Antimafia Direction of the Calabre, against the Mair and the More Vice of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the Mair of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external concourse for mafius association.
The hands also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the Clan and the public administrations, and his young child advocat, homonym of the boss, already condemned for the association of mafiose types, and to pay 10 million euros.
"a contrary against legal and moral rules, and especially the good sense" writers, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to Master Piromalli.
"So it would be granted to the Clan, writeing the judges to enter officially within the maries that facilitate the most important, control and orientation of public administration."
The Chairman of the Calabral Regional Committee Agazio Loiero is not only "collions between local committees and organizated criminality, there are more than one" in his region: "There are places where the mafius intensity is stronger than others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who react to the pressures of the rangheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests of this morning follow the last July, after which the police announced that the Piromalli Clan was disappointed.
Since the end of April, the common advice of Gioia Tauro was resolved; already in 1991, and on the basis of conditions undertaken between the organizated criminality and local administration, local policies were loaded from their function to administrate the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, master of the UDC at the time of the resolution, was called chief of a right center coalition after the ballotation of May 2006.
He cried to the scan when prefecture ordered the resolution of the common Council.
He accused the vice-minister in the time, Marco Minniti, the accuser of having handled everything for a political question, but seeing the request of incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Clan Piromalli was even successful to ask the variation of the A3 project.
Parts of intercepts ordained against Dal Torrion, pm writers, is emphasized " the freedom to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a more known group, near Piromalli, and uniforming the elections of public administration to the interests of the Clan.
When the energy is born of vagues, the big ones are now launched.
This is a decreased gishing that takes more than 70% of the surface of the planet, and now the major world energy companys are intended to discover it.
Vagues, corners, married, here are the new sources on which the colases like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they try to put the hand there.
The possibility of energy from sea movements is studied since hundreds of years, and in the 70s, in conformity with the first petrolium crisis, research has been intensified.
When the price of the low steel, up to 1980, the idea of exploring marine energy was made by side, but now the ecologist instances and the new increase of the pet gives a great extortion to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London was estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world-wide electricity need could be covered by the exploitation systems of the sea horse.
This quantity would be the double of the nuclear centres.
And more, there would be the corners and the marines.
Attach the attack.
The first energy of the marine energy was the Energy, which in 2005 was a agreement to build a installation in the north of Portugal.
When the hearing was announced, we would have said a real revolutionary step.
In two years, more candidates among these companies achieved since always in traditional energy are raised on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying the technologies on the ocean energy - has stated the port-word of a company associated with the American petrolier colosis, on the Economic Day of Wall Street Journal, and it assesss the opportunities to cooperate with us."
The issued cooperation, regarding the obtainment of a permission declared by the United States Energy Commission, required to provide a project of exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, the Uses continue to extract from the petrole, and recently President Bush has set a project for new excavations.
Moreover in Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which walks through the way of the energy coming from the sea, and they are invested until today, although their details are not known, indicating, according to the observers, a growing interest.
Technology to fix.
Experts are still talking about a technology at its beginning, part of the fact that marine energy does not disappear fears against the environmental impact.
In the present time, the systems such as those of Portugal, or some in Ecosse, are small, and they do not seem to make a big problem in the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy from large scale, however, technologies must be used with a higher ecologist impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected boats system.
The poussy of vagus, which moves the bows to top and bottom, is converted into a hydralylic pressure of guns and cilindros within the flowers.
The pressure turns a turbine to its tour, eating a generator.
The energy is sent to the river through rooms under sea.
We now have four systems of this type in a project phase, expecting a unique federal approval and a part of the energy could be used to a military installation.
Verdant Power, in contrast, has already produced energy for a commercial center and a parking using six turbines under the East River of New York.
The movement of the water during the marine, makes the turbine pals, creating a rotation movement that eats a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers watching the required authorisations to energy.
After the eggs, the marines.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the research of electric energy, measured at this time, the potential of marine.
Although it is a phenomenon intermitting, the mare is more precious than the wind, the sun, or the eggs, and so more faithful as the energy source.
And it is just on the energy of marriages that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, looking at costs, invested 7 million and half of dollars in 2008 and offered investments to 35 million in 2009.
