No free Novell for Timothenko through Parliament
Today, the Ukraine Parliament refused to reject the request in the context of a Novell of the Crime Book those paragraphs, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was judged.
The new regulation that had been able to ensure the way to deliver the in arrested Minister of Experiencies had decreased by the second reading of the request to meet the crimes for economic delicts.
Timoshenko was condemned in October because of the conclusion of an adoptional agreement with Russia on the purchase of landgas for seven years.
The judgment is not yet legally forced, in December the calling of the judges shall be negotiated before the judge.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political race of the regime, and also in the West the process made the conscience of the presumption of the Court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Ministry of Expremer was sent to remove from the Criminal Health Book, was supported by 147 deputy.
226 votes would be required to accept.
Libya Sig
The story of the Libya Liberation War or the Libya Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in a unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war is over.
Now it's just to define the guests.
As this region usually, the islamic elections, the question is only what - the reliable or radial.
The National Passover Council was recognized of the famous law of Scharī ăa, of which you now have a certain imagination with God.
Libia would be to the country without criminality, because for the debtstone you would shortly shoot the hand.
Moreover, women should forget the thoughts of the emancipation quickly, eventually religious disorders will be established, and so further.
Instead of a single director, the society will come to the future from the Coran.
Cursive - in Lebanon will reign a order that would not be presented in this country and, in particular, no desire.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objective seen even not the best, and the exchange would not apply to the Liberians mentioned.
So it is more comfortable that Moslem's fighters have helped the unbelievers dogs.
For their forgiveness, only the fact that the NATO air attacks were not led by any general of America, but by God himself, whose power was glorified after all successful trials.
The guests in Lebanon?
We only participated in a switch, the interests of the Islam and our policy were deployed in the person of the director of a political relationship, without that it had been given any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afganistan and Iraq, we would likely see from a military statute of Libyan.
Thus, the Hizkians are a worried worry - so the divorce of the cross carriers.
But do the mineral oil companies also have the black gold for the spott price without occupation?
Not good and so the West can finally praise the right of his selflessness in matters of protection of human rights.
If they don't destroy this Sharī ăa representative.

The food card of a fat child: It's not early and is to bedbrot Wurst
More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with overwhelming, and 9 per cent of all schools and 5 per cent of all children are overwhelmed.
Current reviews - Adipse children are most of the families with unnecessary lifestyle.
So again shows how important a human health development is the mile in which he grows, and the examples that are about him are.
On the tables of adiposous children are plants to half often on the table than in families where normal children live.
More than 19% of the overwhelmed children had on the day of the declaration action under the motto "Adipositas is not a case" Pommes to the evening.
In families with dickers, there is also no sport to love works, however, however, the majority of the schools today - only 15 percent answers that their parents find at least one time in the week for active movement.
Requests under 900 children
The question was found in the past year against the end of the school year, at least about 900 children from basic schools in all Czech.
This was already the second year of the "Adipositas is not a case", which is supported by the general hospital case and the UNilever society.
Before the project, more than 12 thousand students of 4 and 8 classs were shared.
Independent costs and missing movement in the family are the facts that are responsible for the fearful number of children with overweight or even fleeting.
"Only half of the children asked, for example, five times on the day, to eat in the day-time-mode, in the day-day-day-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-shirt-- one of the main provisions for a healthy food," says one of the reviews.
No morning and wedding to night
Experts indicate that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast of the family, are important for health development of a child.
In Czech, only 23 percent of the school families are in Czech.
And - in most families, everybody is for himself alone.
The worst was the definition that in each ten of the family is not increasingly fulfilled.
The morning stage applies to it as the basic stone of the healthy day food.
In the day of the surface of children in the family, the surfaced child was a lot of more injured pommes.
And almost every - without looking on weight - drinks every day sweet limonades (70%)
For more than 40 percent of the children’s sports, but only less than half of their parents do that - only 15 percent.
Make your own menu together
Another part of the question, it allowed the choiced children (204 young and 172 girls from 13 schools) to collect themselves from offered opportunities to appetite and the opinion of their own food plan.
"What chechical children prefer to be in point of food between 12 and 15, is far away from the ideal of a healthy food.
Under their loved foods there are many meal foods, meatrichts, and, naturally, sugar food.
"Attention is, in particular, the great liability of sweet limonates," is reported in the conclusion report to this question.
In the Mediterranean, so the main court, cutting tigwars on the front of the aircraft.
The children were almost not liked, and the love of fish and vegetables was very less.
Health Return
In the same time, the question also showed that children were ready to change their relationships when they receive correct information.
"In many cases, the control group of the questionnaires, which fulfilled the questionnaires after the concluding of the proposal "Adipositas is not a case" was to sign a clear movement of the preferences to the principles of healthy food," was introduced in the results of the project.
It was, for example, in the beauty limos, where many children began to give regular water.
The children crossed in the question bows too many other flights or fish as the main judge of the day and were ready to eat less clothes or food.
Profess - a stylelist must also be a good psychology
In the introduction of the article about how to learn styles, I had a little medicine that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
So I didn't say what's going on.
Proposals of three professions from the broadcast, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how it runs on the place.
It's gonna be worse.
The test is closer to the test, so much more information and practical tasks are before us.
But even if the curs finds each day and Sunday, he is still full.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (in the course doesn't take a single man), as a woman who does not have ideal proportionate figures.
And these are always most of us.
One of them have a short hair, the others a too young figure without regular curves and others are worthy.
It is a thing of the stylist to cut up optically, to launch the hair, or to prevent the needed curves.
We also received tips as a woman type such as Jennifer Lopez - so with a large bus, larger hair and small tail - nice and graphical beauty, unless she is all provocative.
For example, if the difference between the tail and the hair is so large that the rock or the house really doesn't match, you should at least put a piece to measure.
It will not be able to be cut off, because good seat clothing is just untailable.
In such a measured rock you feel so much better than in one of the stage that always goes up to high and broken, in the dimension, etc.
Young figures can be allowed to be driving again with failure, buildings, applications, steakers, or raffination.
In these many information and types, I am happy that I have a whole week time to leave all of my head.
Yet, I fear that it isn't almost to make it in the case of the household.
Each of the court participants has received a promise for which they should consider the corresponding outfits - day clothing and a bendrobe.
We should also consider the current view, the model style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I want Miranda Kerr to "come", which you may know from the Campaign Victoria's Secret.
In the middle of this, because this is personally much better for me than to admit Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which at the last time has been taken to the hundred kilo (only, it's a little override), or the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from the magazines or look for, print, and then edit graphically.
In "Moodboard" as the whole result is called, then our whole personal style and our relationship with the graphical structure will be expressed.
It is very important to consider the graphical side of the style.
The Stylelist does not only make the models pure physical, but also makes the following product pages in the journals (in particular default, for example, trend hands, mantels, etc.).
Davon told us the stylist and Designer Mario Chamber.
But that's just on Sunday.
That means a style must have a good overview.
The sabate proposal made with information on figgy types was fulfilled at the same time by three visitors from the branch:
of the stylist Jan Pokorny, of the model creator Jakub Polanka, and of the modelfotograf Ben Rencz.
Jacob reminded us that mode is Illusion and that should be a stylelist to use this.
And the incoming style can work with a single clothes in a whole different way.
The wizard word is a variability.
Thus, for example, you can take a trenchcoat as living over the Jeans, as a T-shirt or mantel, but you can also take it on the neck body, put it up and take it as clothes.
It's enough to pull up the smoke or the smoke, and the whole look looks very different.
"Play it," he remarked.
But most of the Council came to me, "You must know the rules perfectly."
"First then, you must hurt them," Jacob said.
Finally, I'm sure why we need to break all these teachings, what you can combine, and why, even if you are often seeing all others in the modern journals.
From model views to be very hard.
Thanks to the photograph Ben now I know that a style has had to prepare a lot of more clothing variables than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (sprech ten outfits) to style at least 15 pages.
And even that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks like very different than in reality.
So with all this, you need to be calculated in the setting of the outfit.
This image and style, including half of the success, confirmed us also Jan Pokorny.
So you just need to look at a not just brilliant song that made a world star from the image and marking.
In Czech, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known persons have this often for the outcome of money (the main cause is that I bring something as I look like it is double-shot).
And if any of us leaves the styles, we should be considered that he or she will gain us a whole (minier) size than he or she needs in reality.
Then, then, you need to just go up to make sure that the boulevard presse is writeing that the corresponding promise has been re-ejected or rejected, etc.
Jan and Mario set us in the Sunday heart to not believe that a style is just focused on the mode and then the outfit needs "common".
In his work, he needs to communicate in particular with the people he's styling and he must be a higher psychologist.
People appreciate without offering themselves and standing at his opinion.
"If a manager has given us a manager to sit down their clothes and to find good pieces, we can't cut you out all the disease and say - my God, that's so terrible."
"Man has to find at least a few loving things to which you recommend what you can do," said Mario.
He also showed us a completely concrete thing that should contain a "platztasche" that is called.
So that's a board that you're attached to the dimension and in which all the needed properties are attached to themselves.
Furthermore, clear things such as shoes, shoes, shoes to hair remove or safe steels contains such uses as a nilonfade (with helping the stylist to photograph products, such as handtakes or shoes), special clips, with which the clothing is covered behind, if it is too large (stocks or other cloths are understood that the substance doesn't fall) and naturally neighborhood.
But that we should not only listen, but also can try something practically, we learned how the shoes are correctly underlined.
Moreover, when photographing in the apartment, where the football is, you can cut the shoes outside.
We dressed, and we dressed...
With the shirt, you can't worry the shirt once, so that you don't hurt it.
So you really need to be sent.
Mario rejoiced me by glorifying my "creation" without restrictions.
The mentioned story is not just my strength.
All this was only part of what we have heard at the second weekend translation course.
One has been clear to me - to explore the style on professional level, it's not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal round wants by America
Resent
The original surglose travel is fully dismissable, deletical errors to the route driving to the morning.
It was like to fulfil the ambitions to a large part, but what is useful that, if there is obviously no one had a pleasure to do a little more.
Before he came to the ladentic, the new part of the "The Run" high expectations.
However, he promised that the already-year game series "Need for Speed" move a piece again into a new size and in the playable demonstrations examples he seemed not only to be one of many action games.
We were also neutral, as the inserted passions in which the main protagonist exceeds from the car and continues to feed.
But as it has already been used in NFS, it's a lot of different effects as you had expected.
Certain - potentially, it's correctly comprehensive archae rings, but totally the game is made by some overflow errors that are present in this series more or less than a few years ago.
So it's actually no mistake any more, but more indicators of one incompatible failure of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
Firstly, you will be introduced into the history of which Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to share in an illegal weight, either through America.
In San Francisco, so at the West City, you are in Lenkrad with the job to be first in New York.
Basic ideas contain a whole number of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided in ten steps and in more than 50 individual rounds.
This means that each round will be carried out on other streets and that the individual steps are located in different, sufficiently different and interesting millions.
You don't have a moment to impression that the game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed the previous parts of the series.
So no world movement.
But the traveling through the wilderness, through the most landscape or upward by deeply appeared landscape effects invisiblely approved.
Returning and returning untypical elements a little switch in the individual rounds.
For example, in the wilderness, you will be surprised by a wilderness storm which is strongly limited to the look.
In the mountains, you need to continue to be higher than that you are not protected by a lawine.
Besides, the individual rounds are right behind each other.
Just a few, but they're rich.
Sometimes you try to overcome the number of hosts (in principle a classic rent), then you have time to get (classical rents against the stop), then waiting for another personal dull with a single contractor.
And this is also the police who wants to cut out the whole thing.
A newness is passions in which Jack leaves the cars.
It is more about some interactive animations in which Jack flew before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button in the right moment.
So nothing is complicated.
However, it's surprised that in the game there's a lot of less than you would expect (including only three).
Lastly, this is the fact that it is most important, because this element has at least no chance to be long-wide - it is in the context to the above said to the elements that make the game avoid.
The vehicle model rolls into the footballs of the previous parts.
This means that it seems to be seen by a hot viewpoint, it doesn't mean any trees, otherwise you couldn't mean that it would be bad.
Whoever seeks realistic simulations, you need to look differently.
However, an action-loaded resources will still continue to be justified, although you can find better in competition.
Before there's all right.
Really, real problems just after some time.
In accordance with the vehicle model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind is not enough to expect that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you practically have any object of understanding how the car is related, it is clearly not all right.
Typical example: When you enter the cars or preventing, you're in some positions to the other cars only easy, in others, nearly identical situation, but you're coming into the sliders and turns the wilde pirates.
Or the carrier goes like a shoot.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't work any more, it's usually worse.
Restarts are so solved: if you have total shoes or land outside the street, then you take a game back to the last end of the streams.
Only - in every road, you have only five restarts.
If you've got her out, everything's gone out of here.
So the restarts are more than something like a helper, for the case that something doesn't matter, but you shouldn't love yourself.
But sometimes it doesn't help the restart, there is nothing else than learning the critical section from the head.
The explanation is inappropriate that the same things often happen to the same positions.
Some curves, for example, must be fully specific, and otherwise do not match.
In other ways, the "cyvil" cars are always in the same configuration, unlike whether you come as first or five, five seconds ago or a minute later.
This is especially worried in situations, if you see that the contract is prevented before a player to two incoming cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in a position that you need to turn or break them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, it's all so concise that it's always close to this situation before your nase.
The contractors have more benefits.
In the whole game, there are several places where you are always going on the same position from the same gas and also here without looking on the time.
The most amazing is this to end the game on the long bridges that are happening in the direction.
The contractor needs to take one out of here clearly on the devil.
And if he's already before one, he's sure he's looking, so you're starting the car a few times in the clump.
It's clear - you want to make the game easier and slighter, but this view is so clear that it loses the joy in the game quickly.
And that's bad, because, although a simple vehicle model is the game totally maintained rightly, and it also shows that you don't know almost where one of the head is.
And in the principle, it's no matter what's the "sufficiency" is - the concept with fifty-uniform routes, the order of the roads on a way that no long-term can go, or something else...
An unlikely idea is also the car change in the roads.
You can't overview the tanks at the street, because you can just change the car, although in most cases the car that you have just.
The cars are divided in three categories.
The sport cars are good for the citizen areas, the strong American limouses for the right cars and exotic super sport cars for the technical cars, for example in the Serpentine in the mountains.
Man in hand with the mode of the game history, also the task mode (requiring requirements) - so the roads in the individual locations you know out of the history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for its own profile, which is common for the tasks (request requirements) and the history.
In order to reach the higher vehicle level, various circumstances must be concluded: start from the car until to the background for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online function Autolog, which compares its own results with other players and also care for other collective functions.
One of the other unbelievable snipers is a situation in the last round of the story.
Here you come with the car in a U-baan tunnel (meinet) where you are in darkness on the shadows (meinet).
On the tacho, the numbers between 150 to 200 km/h (meinet), but one time from behind a U-bad and leads a compromiss to shot.
In our edition, we will even fight longer about whether it was a blackout of the player or whether the authors were so foolish for us.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the entire expression of the most cases is right, and there is even brilliant.
Moreover, it is that, in some exciting moments, the smoking frequency of images will be longer and that is very dramatic.
However, the cases with greater number of participants are concerned, where a continuous FPS does not use anything.
The sound playing is at least O.K. and the sound track is smoking.
In trying to consider a wide as possible scala more younger publics, there is a sound track a la la "of any thing" - but who buys a game for the music?
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more missed.
If the game doesn't fall through the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have said that the Run is the best part of NFS in the last years.
But that's how bad the game is.
A classy pleasure to yourself, but it should be prepared for one of these errors with the power of aircrafts in the eyes.

EU-Botschafter Vicen:
The Chess have the call of Negatives and Euroskeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the equal growth of the individual institutions feel likely from the lot."
I hadn't expected that such a hard war was burning."
"It will be five, six years until the weddings will be fulfilled and everybody will be reached to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech Commander in the European Union, rightly attached their proposal to the juristic factory.
As it was serious to take the motive "It is clear and open about Europe", she had already shown in the first part of its proposal, where she had been able to describe the individual organizations of the EU and their relative relationships to such a surveyable and understandable way that they could be so many Lectors of the legal factors of the Carl University.
Mrs. Vicen also glorifyed the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initial crisis was said that he was too unexpected - a gravity employer who didn't grow such a role, but I have to say that it has destroyed all the atoms how good he has accepted the matter.
"It is a man who has done it to listen to twenty-seven Member States patiently to communicate with them and has most clear suggestions of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the high representative for external matters and security policy explained them as an answer to the question: Who is the fact - the European Union? What number will I call?", so as an important step to enhance and better readableness of the EU policy against States, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to provoke us our oiled quarter
Mrs. Vicenová also made the Agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lived and in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago mentioned it as success.
The Chechens would have meeted the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also established the shipping of the Eastern Partnership.
In the case of the Government during the President, it was a great negative, which has been strongly attached to the picture of the Republic of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Representation in the EU is now to make all the hands full.
With the words of the messenger, it was not only in the presidency, but also in the final crisis that is not overwhelmed until today.
And there is still the seven-year budget of the EU, which makes it very complicated because of the present economic situation.
If there is a slight and horrible budget, which economic prevention, which countries are more and less promoted, all this is now on the agenda.
The newspaper also reminds her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Aware of Europe."
"If I don't like anything, then there are gracious cuts, foreign words and pharmacists that no one understand.
How can I know as citizens, whether you really want to be cut off or rounded in Brussels and some large bananes, or if someone really wants to provoke us the Quargel.
It would also like to use the EU's grounds to get more Chess in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In view of the EU's employee, the Chess are called to be Euroskeptics, which consider more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
Increasingly, the weak representation of Chechens in European institutions.
So many factors are caused, including the recovery of our candidates, which are impossible to write motivation letters and not last support of the Czech Site.
Outside the successful Czech Presidency, she also made the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which also occurred in V4.
"Remember me, if a pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slowake is near me, then the French is near me, "Hey, what do you put the heads together - it's your V4?" and it makes a very serious mine.
Mrs. Vicen expects the EU in the future in particular severe rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As far as a "European Federation", it looks at the concept of a European's two or more different speeds.
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen room and we already have the institution of a strong cooperation."
"In the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate with it and those who don't want it should be quiet."
"There will be given more and more of such institutions, which will end up to a strong "Europe of various speeds", Mrs. Vicenová expected.
In this regard, they also encouraged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to all the subjects with impact on the EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The IBM innovator is in the second century his existence
If you want to find a corresponding word that IBM's strategie is characterized at the most precise, then this would be the word "Longlevelity".
For the wide public IBM, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, you know it as a modern company, although since its foundation has already been broken a centuries.
The basis of this long-termness has already set her first chief - the Visionist Thomas J. Watson son.
While he said to Slogan, multiple world problems were easy to resolve if people were ready to think a little.
His Slogan "Think!" was marked to play the life of the future Gigant (and simultaneously on the title of the firm internal magazine that has already started to be published in IBM in 1935).
This was also the foundation of the company culture prepared by waters.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thought means a continuous movement in the future.
IBM survived and has also been successful for a whole century because it remains faithful and not turned back to change all other ringsums.
This allowed us to transform technologies, businesses and society during our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from the jubileum.
Transparent system
Watson has already operated in the three-year-old social employees - in a similar way as the Bataja undertaker in the Chechoslowakie: IBM leaders were paid as one of the first American employees, a security by the companies and more elegante uniforms as a worker closing and a trained release system for the best news and manufacturers.
The long-term relations of IBM with their clients are also excluded.
The company was from the beginning in the balance promotion - as one of the first firms worldwide, IBM raised every discrimination - and he could therefore proceed.
In accordance with this antidiscrimination strategy, it is also the current plan that the Palmisan is replaced by a woman in the next year by Virginia Rometty.
It is already 30 years in IBM, until she took the position of the vehicle, marketing and strategy chef.
IBM makes such online broadcasts in the last years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonderful - ideas are enough, at least half million people are busy in the company.
A Institution with a good call
Your unsearch position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
"For the beginning IBM had the concept of a Institution as a single technical undertakings," said the Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology undertaking, but a company that helps business problems to help technologies," added George Colony from Consulting Firma Forrester Research.
As the company himself indicates, it is a different difference to be present on the market or to form it directly by this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos named by the family "Big Blue" is grown in one of the largest companies of the world in one century.
It is one of the most most technology undertaken - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation facilities in an untrusted product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
From all American technology undertakings, IBM has most patents and five of his partners have been designed with the Nobel Price.
His recognised findings are included, for example, bank automobiles, credit cards, financial weapons, Strich Code or diskettes.
With $220 billion Bürsen value (Mark Capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology undertaking (like Apple), which was first reached since 1996 from Microsoft.
The Preview
Not all products and innovations found the smack of customers of today - infelizly, for example, the trial with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't be emotionally linked to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its basic walls on various platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
Instead of the matching Microsoft player, which is in the principle of his operating Windows system.
Successive technologies
The IBM wins participate in the largest measure of services, software and hardware.
It was still 1990 hardware with more than fifty per cent of the most strongest part.
Since 2000 IBM was reduced a little winning activity in the value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in future technology.
In these investments, IBM continues to continue after 2008 when the new financial crisis on the first time as a storm over the world.
IBM also stayed here to the comprehensiveness of his first Chefs Thomas J. Watson, who increased in the middle of the major world economic crisis.
Before IBM seems to be able to overcome the current crisis.
The value of IBM acts increased rarely to 120 per cent since 2008 and the purchase wine of the company continued to grow.
The IBM company log says that everything can be changed - not only the values.
Therefore, this flexible gigant is also the next crisis.
IBM history: From the ships to the World Air Flights
The company based IBM (international Business Machine) has started a right complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took her first 1924 - originally was a mark mark mark for a disagreement in Canada and South America.
The basestone for the latter society IBM has set the fusion of four companies who have the history to the 80s of the 19th century.
They provide technologies such as the famous steel cards to register the beginning and end of the work.
For the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the President in the supervisory Council until 1930.
And it was Flint, who set the captain of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him in the direction of the company.
This leader also put IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today the invisible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company to 1952.
IBM, started, as the name has already been distributed, with the production and the distribution of all possible machines for the trade - of wrest- and coseskiners until the box.
In the first four decades, where Watson led the company, he doubled their costs to nine million dollars and the company spread out and after all continents.
Watson was so unbelievable for the company that he was sitting in the office for 40 years, first then he was disappointed by his son Thomas Watson Junior.
IBM started working on the development of artistical intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, the technology and computers of IBM of the NASA flights were helped to lead to all - to the Mercur and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous airport of humans to the month.
Under this IBM developed in 1964 the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard in that time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Thirty years later IBM distributed his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, otherwise, they purchased the customer part of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers and increased it full and completely in the business with consulting services and services with higher more value.
The IBM strategy paid in the last three years is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It is urgent to use technologies in a wise way in which there is no longer planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and in the town management.
In the trade sector IBM, the platform "Smarter Commerce" was not long-term to help the manufacturers to lead the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong story in Czech.
In 1932 IBM was based on a reduction in the Czechoslowakie, as mostly the first country in Central and East Europe.
Today IBM CHR includes a strategic Outsourcing Center in Brünn.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is divided in Prague and here is also a top research team of the world level that is considered by the technologies of the sound identification.
Darina Richteria on their untrusted gates:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtary (53) says - now it's Cluss!
After her married Joseph Ricktaire (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph was waiting for his rose dream and came home.
But now it is finally done with patience and for the further life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Ricktaire.
As Darina Riechtary of the Singerin I. Bartoš was invited to fly in her own house, you would probably not have been dreamed as it appears to her husband.
When Iveta went out on her trains after 30 days and returned to Rochean, Joseph went on the same way.
He even knows that he loves them.
With that time Darina resigned, it seemed even like she wanted to try again with her unbelieving man - but now she gave him the passenger.
It's not like to sleep with his wife.
If the Richter Iveta Bartoš should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms home.
"He's the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common house, then I will not go out of him."
"Anyway, not as loved, distracted old ass, but as a man with which I still have some commitments," said Mrs. Ricktaria; but she also said that she has already been emotionally separated from him and has set themselves on the contrast.
The circumstances that Darina has broken him in the front, Josef takes the ground with courage.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying together with Iveta, there's nothing to change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues to run, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the basket, I'll buy the income."
"My Darina is totally normal, but we don't share the bed even," said J. Riechtar (the Blatt) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, then he doesn't want to leave them.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm sure that this is my fault, I loved myself in Iveta and therefore I take every responsibility.
The worst instincts: How is it with you?
If you invite the men to call some typical famous instincts, they will be able to protect some prompts out of the brain.
Beloved women, do you recognize you again in the next lines where we leave a few unseen revues that put the blood to the men in the Adern walls?
Incoming search
Would they like to be income?
Do you have to buy at least one hair a weekly?
Do you like to buy and you can also be a little more in actions?
Then it's really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are understood at least and trying to keep their income losses halfway under control.
But the hand on the heart, which woman already looks for looking for a good seat clothing only by a clothing, and doesn't try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if the investment for most women is a hobby, the men are often the pure hell.
You know how often they have told her husband -- you're gonna stay outside...
Permanent incompatibility
"I'm not too dick?"
"I have to take at least five kilos -- I'm going to start jugging or gimnastic?"
"I'm sure I'm sure about you?"
Does it happen to them?
Yeah?
Then you will also be the women who are regularly occupied of what they look like.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly on if their wife always worry about her look.
The stronger generation is a single - with increased frequency of convictions, women are always incomprehensive.
Order and sauberity on the first place
It's a fight against windsmills.
The windows smooth, the flowers and the ships, the ships smooth - and this at least two times in the week.
Steady with her partner because he was driving back with painful shoes on the sauce flowers, you hurt the children because the cutting waste is already threatened and because the glass of the room has already been cutting up again, where the police makes a lot of mug?
If you are painful under this type "Devianz", you should know that you cannot override nothing and that the order and sadness of the family lives are not in the first place.
This unmaxious cleaning branches can finally disturb the relative relations and, in particular, the relationship in the family.
Snapshots
"The smooth tournhosen come into the wheel corb."
"Do you really want to get the old socks tomorrow again?"
"A nancy handtuch doesn't just run on the football."
If your partner is taking such a tired, you can't be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course it's not bad, but they just want that's all right.
If the men knew that, the women might not need so much to mecker.
Clark and Tratch
Some women like to slay and track, there will be touched or cut down behind the back, or wearing a lot or smoking smoke.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to replace such subjects, such as, for example, who, with who, like, and why.
Everyone of us has a little harmless cletch and tratch on the board.
The hands on the heart - that's probably all women.
However, it is not to replace with the greatest calibrators, which are nothing and no one is holy, who are even disobeying every one in their environment, and especially for women's collectives a significant danger.
Jagr and Voračk helped Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockeystürmer Jaromir Jagr had a major part of the NHL Monday game with two assistents at 5:3-site of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, and thus is the most productive chess player in the NHL.
The user of the overview of the ninety-third Year Eishockeystars was in two cases Claude Giroux, who added another assistance and called to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also described Jagr's Joint Jakub Voráczek.
Jagr talked after the journalist game, he had Giroux a great night prophecy.
"Shoon before the game I tell him that he's a hattrick today."
I had something in my feeling."
"He and again overcomes such a feeling," Jagr explained, after the action Giroux had already made a door at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second trip also had a "the Chess Spur".
Voráčk fighted behind the door of Hurricanes the puck and set it between the crowns of the Max Talbot successful.
One second before the chapter of the first third party, the home player Patrick Dwyer received a short-handler, but the third was then the Flyers again.
Perfect Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr, he made his third trip, then Wayne Simmonds leaving their shoes to the fourth gate.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the Liga, but, definitely, he is the best three," Jagr urged his center.
"I wouldn't have been in the life that I wouldn't play with an Eishockey player in the end of my carriers."
"It's a pleasure."
"I shoot my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL, my partners put their game on me and now the skin turns around," smuggled Jagr.
Carolina made a game still to the drama - through the trailer of Tuoma Rutua and again Dwyer, who was translated from a crime committee, came to a door.
But Matt Read stopped any further complication in which he was two to one successful.
"Excellently acted progeners still in our area."
"He exclaimed the puck, I took a travel, and (Read) went to remote phoses."
"I tried to meet him and I'm happy that it's hungry," described the last staff of the Partie from his view.
Thus, Philadelphia was sitting at the east conference.
The technical refugee player of Montreal Jaroslav Spauchek shoot in the game against Buffalo and shoot in the third party because of a loss in the top body.
Candians smoothed near their knowledge of Beck also their guidance in the penalty shoes 2:3.
One of the criminals could not change Thomas Plekanec.
More than the lost points suffered the trainer of the homemanship, even the high disease event in the defensive - the game they played only with five remote players.
"This is bad."
"The match we just played with a single achieved player at the end, the rest was young player."
"But there is nothing to do so that we should be done," said Jacques Martin.
"In every change, a attack room after the other and we didn't have to fix it."
"We had to make the game easier and have to get the puck out of our third party."
There's still reserves," says P. K. Subban, one of the remote players.
The Czech Porter Ondříj Pavelec was thirty-shots from Tampa Bay and took so hard to 5:2-site over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which concluded a series of five deadlines, had five different protectors.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Since 1989, there was only five national reise offices in the damage CSSR: Cheedok, Sportrist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel offices sold in the socialistic east block countries, in the west only chosen ones.
And so the Chess tourists went to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), in the Sowjetunion (Stosh on the Half Krim on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania at the Black Sea and Hungary to Balaton.
A lot of exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, while it was attempted to travel after Jugoslavia, then Yugoslavia struck a proper course and therefore the journeys were restricted to Jugoslavia.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not allowed to go free in the framework of the socialist countries in the east block (including the Chechoslowakes).
If a citizen of the CSSR, for example, wanted to travel individually to Poland or more to the Soviet Union, he needed such an invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
Although the travel offices also bought travels in the west, then they had to take big shoes to buy or even in the room for the travel office, or at least " good knowledge" in the office.
Even so, it wasn't long enough.
The devise sugessage - the conditions for a removing in the west - only "politically allowed" people - the others have no need to walk.
The Chechoslovaquian monetary was not a free cross-border currency, so it would have been impossible to get the necessary finances (west money) for a travel in the West.
Thus, most of the Chechens have broken their grounds in Inland, no wonder that the Chechens have buyed uncommon weekend houses and dates - a story that is going to today.
The same revolution of 1989 followed a Chechen's relief on the foot.
During 1989, a DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Chechens broken in the past year 4,5 million of their foreign ferries in the entire world.
A powerful paradox which you have not been known today is the fact that you could not travel in the most popular country of the Czech - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the Yugoslavia.
According to the beginning of the 1990s of the past century, the Devise obligation was taken into the obstacles of West European countries, which have been carried out from a short visit, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Chechoslovaquis could not just get enough from their journeys in the west, everybody wanted to be there at least a few days.
Thus, the Chess' Uruguays slept at the traveling to Paris in the park, because who had already had the money for a hotel or in a pension.
A typical character in the foreign travels of Chechen was a container, beer and long-term room, including full-packed coffee room.
A more important meilenstein was the introduction of the free chess crowns - after decades, our tourists could finally purchase the western money.
Our life level and that is also the average factors, which included 1997 in more important moments.
Thanks to the increased reviews on traveling, the offices started to prepare regularly by charter flows, with which the aircrafts were incompatible with the possibility of negotiating amount rackets in comparison to past.
At the end of the 90s, the Chechens, except the United States, had already devised payment traffic with all high-wide countries of the world, which had done the travel still easier.
A further interesting moment in the history of the "post-alls" traveling was in 2000 when the high demand of the first direct charter airport was released in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Seither flows all year direct charter flows with chechical passions in a lot of dreams; in this year you are directly flowing from the Czech twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 T.T. Chechens walk each year in exotic countries!
A more significant moment in the epoche that identified our "postrevolutionary" development has come in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States raised the visa responsibility for the Czech tourists, where our country was definitively attached to the high-developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czech reached more than half of their offers in the outland (50,3%) and first in their history, they gave them for a single rate of the costs in the field of shipping more than 15 TZK per head.
The main assembly should find a new president - a pattern again.
At least five months, the Czech Fußball has no president, and the follower of Ivan Haschek would not be known once after the extraordinary main assembly in Nymburk.
There is not yet any union on which election should be chosen until today.
And without this, there is no vote on the three potential followers.
Three interests want to handle the chessical football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Pacific.
In June, Hashek returned from his function, as he requested his colleagues to find a strong person who could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the Era to Hashek, the old cherelens were raised again between the two rooms that couldn't be a joint candidate.
This was shown and clear on 16 September when the new President should be chosen.
The delegated delegates of the Main Congregation were totally convinced to the people's house in Prager Fourth Smichov, because the negotiation had no results, and it was not only about the choice.
In fact, there could not be some of them who are actually responsible for the full congregation - only the representatives of the adjustment or the functions issued with a full power.
In this one point, it was at least part of the unity that also contributed to the recommendation of the State Institute for and the law, which is not strictly considered after a representation on the entire power base.
However, the fights around the election order continue to continue.
The Executive Committee also had no more clarity in the case of the meetings - unlike whether it is ordinary or extraordinary - in the principle there is nothing else in the agenda.
Even when the opinions in relation to the choice changed a few times - the neural grec point remained the same.
The question says: How should you go in the 3th round to delay a patt situation?
"The street point is the question of whether you should act in accordance with the establishment or whether a whole other model should be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three staff presidents of the FACHR, which in the management of the professional football.
In the third round of the candidate, which receives the greater percentual support in the room for which he candid.
Mothers are ready to enter the compromiss that the candidate takes the higher number of votes from two rooms.
The Czech Party continues to reach the condition that the guaranteer has at least a double number of votes.
"The two grounds have no sense, that way would be the whole duplicate concept," Svoboda understands the income of the maritime side that is the best found to not move the choice, but is to choose a valid arrangement.
It is also surprised to Tomáš Pacific, even if it is described that all candidates of the first party of Pelta are excited.
"My desire is that it will be chosen at least after the establishment."
"It will not be considered increasing replacement variables, as in the last main congregation," explained the property (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, which candidated first and restricted its opinions in respect of Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
His opinion will be known to the new president in Nymburg and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The potential quality of the national society for the football EM today would be sure to enhance the merchants."
"When the football is only on the euphorical wealth, it is also a greater preparation for cooperation," says the officer of Jablaec, which includes the greatest experiences of all three adoptions, and it is also professional, as well as regional levels.
Rajchl is back there.
"I hope an unity, but the situation is difficult to be duplicated."
"This is not a matter between people of booms and marriages, but there are some efforts to "just the rules to their own purposes."
"It's why a re-locking is not excluded in the main congregation."
"But I hope that the healthy human understanding ends," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to enter all pages is not left.
Some negotiations should be able to play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be fully complete to the qualification game.
The charter airport, with the other Dalibor Kučara and Rajchl to Podgorice, could not be started on the morning in Prag because of a technical disaster, and so it seemed to seek a replacement variable, however, a part of the executive committee would still be brought to the expenditure place of the shipping game.
Finally, the meeting on the ministry is determined to come at the middle of the Mediterranean.
Josef Dobeš, the Ministry for Schoolwesen, Youth and Body Disorder, would like to move the placed parties within the largest sportband of the country.
It is therefore much in the game: State uses, confidence of the Chess Fußball and also the main collection of the CSTV, which will show the Chess Sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction.
The Pacific is in the fight against the position of the President because he does not see any appropriate candidates
If Thomas Pacific, the chief of the footballs before the external assembly, could have achieved a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his proposals on the new president of the Football Board of the Republic (FACHR), would not have been fulfilled at the fight against this place.
"If it gives a good advice, I would fight for him and fight against the choice."
"But in the present situation, it was not supposed to find such adoption," said Pacik CTK.
The main reason for the Pacific, in Duell to go with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, is to prevent that the positive favorites of the choice, Pelta, are at the field of the FACHR.
Pacific also indicates that, in the case of his summer, he would only consider the function of the President for a year, so until 2013, until the date of the regular main assembly.
In the position of the Chairman, he would like to see a known top manager that was not very deleted in the football story.
"I have spoken personally with some people in question."
"It is impossible to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"The same views would like to be changed," he said.
At most of all, the Pacific offers the connection of Pelta's with the President of the Pilsner's Fußballband Roman Berbr, a man with controversy call, which applies to the bullies as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated agreements on main meetings.
For the Pacific, it is unreceptable that Pelta had the position of the President.
"Besides his guidance, the present state would be conservated and in the Czech football it didn't even go forward."
"The support by Berbr, a clear Businessman, attached to the football double," said Pacific.
He also plays that Pelta's name was in connection with telephone audiences in a corruption affair, however, from Pelta was tried.
"I don't know what prestige is to bring a ransom from Pelta to the football."
"And how we would be in the eyes of the EUFA and the FIFA," said Pacific, who's his previous expression, "he'll sell the pillball club when Pelta is president," but it's already something left.
If the Pacific goes in the Sunday election, he may, however, propose a future cooperation with Pelta.
It also thinks that another candidate - Rajchl, the Pacific was supported before the main congregation in October, who ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him, for example, as the chief of the National Communities."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the manager."
"I'm not stealing my nase in issues I don't understand," said Pacific, who had so concerned in September that he stayed behind the challenge of the Court of Justice with Ludíík Macela in the spitze, replaced Damková.
Pacific himself said that he feels growing in the role of the President of the Congress.
And he calls on his ability to lead private companies, since the past room he also is the chief of pills, who served the first triumph in the Liga with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football field and contribute to a certain culture of this."
"To be limited to the influence of certain interest groups to affect disciplineary and professional committees, which are attached to in contrast situations," pointed Pacific, which makes no held from his antipathy, for example, against Sparta-head Daniel Crotinas.
As one of his priorities, he considers the establishment of the relations between the FACHR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby with the political policy, that more money will be able to flow in the sport.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new president should take up."
"When it comes to establish a happy game, how the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, and then they must also be clear and clear to tell where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club does not even see as a handicap, although he is attached to himself, the Chairman of the FACHR must be "transparency".
Pelta is connected to Jablaec again, Rajchl with the Prager Dukla.
"This isn't just ideal."
"It's not too much meaning to transmit my acts in the pillner club, likely to a third person to return back after another half years," said Pacifik clearly.
Pelta promises new arrangements of the FACHR, which are currently excluding a Patt situation.
Two days before the main meeting of the football conference promises one of the candidates for the president of Miroslav Pelta, he will strengthen himself in the case of his choice that the FACHR has received new states, except in the future fighting on the election of the forehead.
The functioner of Jablaec is intend to be transparent before the Sunday negotiation in Nymburk, and believes that the choice fight will be sure that the technical election will be successful.
Pelta had already promised the non-realised election in September, he wanted to concentrate his choice on the national community and purchase of financial instruments.
He decided only at the last time to participate in the election before the last main congregation, and so he wanted to help him the two-month pause to defend his proposals on the direction of the football and present in a larger context.
"Levels on all levels are looking at the football, they are unfortunate and expected that the president is known on the Sunday."
"He feels that it's the highest time to be leaving to someone, the man, who, in particular, has been linked to the jableecer club, but also acted many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experiences to lead the Chess Fußball.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election is responsible for the Euphoria ruling in time of Ivan Haschek.
"It was very difficult to be made at the main congregation in June, which were not so perfect as they were all adopted.
If they wouldn't have allowed various statements, we would have already had a president since September," Pelta said.
In addition, the processing of the main document of the citizens agreement he used as the delegated locks.
"If I would be president, then I would take it personally and I'm ready to take personal responsibility if it doesn't get it."
"This is a primary thing without he can't be," said Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to restrict his contractors.
Although he had announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his candidate would be his first representative.
Tomas Pacifik also took no longer, who has not left the grounds of Pelta again.
In the football he moves for a year and has already been able to prove some success."
"But his attacks were cut off, and many were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, too, many now are in his real character," said Pelta, his contractor, who probably remain faithful to his proclamation, which he has already expressed in September.
His opinion is his strongest weapons the knowledge of the football from the bottom game class until to the national community.
And this should be the difference of the Czech footballs.
"I would also try to finish all the matters - from the Cause Bohemian's Cause, until the reach of the Corruption Canal from the past year."
"Therefore then, I would take me to negotiate with the private and State sector to ensure sufficient financial instruments for the whole football," said the CHTK candidate, sixty-fifty-year-year-old candidate.
At that time he also promised that his income in the front of the Czech football would not be significant personal smoking.
"I had to trust me only once with the employment content of all employees," he said in Strahov direction, where the long anarchie is obviously dominating Nervocity.
Instead of the current catastrophical scenarios that join the next main congregation, he believes that the delegated on Sunday does not even go to Nymburk.
"If it really should be the only step point, as you choose in the third round, then we'll go to it."
"The football needs faithfulness and the winning is only back if he finally has a new leader," remains Pelta two days before the possible decision day of his functionary carriers.
Rajchl agrees that the FACR begins to work hardly under him
If the previous president of Jindrich Rajchl should be chosen on the main assembly on the Sunday to the new president of the Foodball Conference of the Czech Republic, this would likely decline many people in the band.
Rajchl promises that you begin to work hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve Bohemian's case to improve EUFA and FIFA relations, to bring more money to the football and to continue the work that Ivan Haschek has started before.
"Al President, I want to put me into the football as a whole."
Initiates the international contacts for the EUFA and FIFA, the national choice, the professional football, until to the shipping football for the young."
"Damit, I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for CTK.
"I am a team player, therefore I want to distribute the competents in the Executive Committee so that each member takes a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks to prevent the football in each segment with miles steps."
Moreover, many would not just be useful because they, instead of criticize the work of others, should now really be very hard to work," he added.
Since the critical atmosphere in the football movement has gone into consideration, mostly, no longer candidated.
"To me know I'm working 20 hours day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't cut off the bottoms between the feet and every step that I'm doing to ask," he said as a statement why he's prepared.
"But many people told me that I don't have to forgive, because it would do others."
"This is confidence that you can't play," he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work that he started under Hashek.
"In two years, we have made a big part of work, and I don't just want to leave it."
"It's been started processes that almost only in a few years of exercise and I would just see that she stopped someone," he said, "and brings his mind to express that for the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose to return the situation in time before Hashek.
"I believe systematical actions and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Besides him stand before all people who would do the football that he would be just for the election."
I'm sure you can imagine some, but not that I'm party."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want a football for everyone because it's all right and not only the elections," said Rajchl.
He also resists the opinion that he is only a president of the Chess.
"Every even if some people say the same part, I really proposed to do the best possible for marriages."
"For example, it's time to overcome if you don't share the ligue in a chechical and medical part, their winds will be raised up in the first ligue."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three miles clubs in the Liga, especially for young players in marriage," says Rajchl.
Since the chief of the Pilsner Club Thomas Palikik has now been attached to the fight against the function of the President, Rajchl would not like to assess his chances that he would be chosen.
"I have a strong support in the Czech room, which has chosen me to his staying President and now recognizes that clear success is behind me," Rajchl, also amended the companion of billion crowns for non-profit contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery health as its success.
On the other hand, he is a part of the crime that the convention does not belong to a single street.
While he says of Pelta, "He has been disqualified from before to help the Chechical football to trust newly," he takes the second rivals - Package for a strong candidate who really has offered something to the football.
"Nobody can ask that he has worked in pills only in a year."
"If he is chosen, then he would have continued to continue the things Ivan Haschek has introduced and also the personal provisions in the Commission would have not changed primarily."
He wouldn't want to move the things to his goods,' said Rajchl over his rivals.
Europe's beautiful pools
Draw to Blue
From Julia Stanek
Plansheets in Ufo-optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who is traveling through Europe can live his blue wonders - and after a city tour or a smoking the weak feet in smooth woods.
A book shows where Wellness is the best in the water.
When Iris Meder went to investigation in the past half years, one was not missing in their packs: their bathroom.
Returning on the water, she looked highly in artificially struggled bullets, they departed smooth marmor putters who waited on them at the border, and stood on acribic restaured young style smokes.
When you felt a bath, she took it quickly in her notesbook - and valuable details about the building and history of the building.
More than 200 Swimmbads architectural historian Meder in this way - and now shows them in their exactly appearing book "Badelights" for: people swimmings in munchen, historical bathrooms in the Black Wald, "Hardcore-Betonbautes" in Taunus.
In 13 countries, they brought their "good to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": near Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited locations in Italy, France, Czech, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and even a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old Germany is a real batteculture enthusiastic.
With sport, she doesn't have a lot in the heat, says Mother - only in the water it's different.
It is amazing that swimming fans must be found with blue balls and clorgestank, while jogger can cut the worm of wheel woods or smooth the happy birds in the park.
"I asked a day, why the swimming man must always be so hungry," says he in Vienna lives.
"So I started gathering beautiful balls."
Water Interface Duplicate Architecture
Platts in the skin and ethical sauna-oile - the wellness factor in the bottlen is so large because all senses are understood, so Meder.
And when the buildings have been made, the swimming hairs can be a true shadow: "Instead of a foot ground, there is a water board in the woods."
"It's one way of transparency, it spreads on the other side, but the beauty of the whole building is against."
Everything is duplicated optically: high weight, smooth balls, smoking breads.
The small-formated image band "Badelights" is distributed on 190 pages of science values about the architecture and cultural history of the historical Wellness-Osen - but, in particular, makes pleasure on a smoking in the blue.
Observed exemplary discovered the Pool Sammler Mader in their research in Hungary.
Besides precious health bodies such as the 100 years old Shechenyi-bad in Budapest found a nitrate water in an urgent carstheale (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a termalbad filled with alcal water and found in a flash formal building (Varosi Terminalfürdö in Jasberine).
Spectacular views offer a lot of famous freezers in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye, you can look at the outside pool of a bath in St. Anton on the snipped Arlberg - and: There is a window from which you can watch the drive on the ski-piste.
The most extraordinary pool design expects badegases in long field: the Aquadome otztal seems like a just in the alpe.
From three to top open shields, it is in the winter, while the mountains of the oxen in the sky.
Alhambra in Black Wald
Not in each swimmbad, the Pool Sammler mounted the plot of chlor in the nase.
Many thermal bottles are swallowed up in the Arpaad Bad in the Ungarian Bekescsaba so strong to Heizöl, which is unfortunately believed to be landed in a healthy bathroom.
The product comes from the alcali-hydrogen carbonate heatwater, which is almost black and his slide is rolling one on the hair when you can go into the bottoms - a wellness result of the special type.
In one place, Iris Meder was looking for her beautiful bathrooms, however, also discovered: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The 1902 was closed by the Architec Duschan Jurkovic architecture.
As Meder looked through the ransom window of the red-white-year-year-old young style woods, she saw how distracted between the flowers.
The effect of the destruction has gone into a amazing swimmbad in the Black Wald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three building phases have already been behind the bathroom; you can not only detect neomanic elements that are from the time of his creation in 1844, but also a moral hall in Alhambra style, which was added for 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the Pool Kennerin Iris Meder - and it is not only because it is originally from the Black Wald.
"It's already a ransom to smoke so different building styles to a so beautiful unit," says Mede.
In such a palast, the plot in the thermalpool is clearly opened only in the neighborhood.
Agrar-Speculation
The German bank allows the raw business
From Christian Teevs
Did the German bank make its business with agricultural substances?
After SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann invited a working group to check the consequences of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the Concerner wants to take consequences.
Hamburg -
For the contract citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of the Germans is not acceptable by a study that banks with agricultural rounds such as wine or mas.
Two third parts of the questions require that the German Bank and other credit institutions exceed from this business because the problems of the world's worst.
This is the result of a forsa review in the work of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study based on a report presented by the Foodwatch Middle October.
The author Harald Schumn shows that the weights to the global raw bottles take the prices to the height, and therefore the banks take a mistakes in the world's famine problem.
The campaigns of the consumer's protection campaigns are particularly against the German bank head Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Initially, road nuts were thought to ensure the hands against price changes.
However, in the middle of the most experts are the only one that the zockers have linked themselves from offers and questions - and do the costs of the best professions.
Otherwise, when the US competitors reacted to the crisis: He promises to check the proposals and said no business is "value to set the good call of the German bank on the game."
After information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, a International Working Group is currently checking the provisions of the Foodwatch report.
At the end of the year, the test will be completed, then the results will be presented to the state of the German bank - and recommendations to be fulfilled.
In the end of January, the bank's fingers will then be informed of what consequences they take.
At the end, a reduction of the raw employment may be, or even the complete department.
Ackermann based on his image
Foodwatch-head Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but also strengthened its critical criteria at the financial branch: "The weight on high prices of food shows particularly drastical, how unrespectful banks today are worse."
Ackermann stands as the highest bank lobbyist now particularly in the obligation.
"The German Bank has to stretch all the items from its portfolio which will be used for weights to food prices," said the Body.
"If Mr. Ackermann goes to hunger people or the call of the German bank."
The view of Ackermann is surprised on the first view, but it is clear that the concert wants a perfect image from the office for a few months before his department.
On Monday, the German Bank knew that the staff was not changed in the supervisory Council.
With a decline from the restricted agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And to make possible instructions, he needs not to hurt himself -- so he would finally do his followers.
Each second would announce racial additives
Foodwatch is trying to maintain the pressure on the manager.
There are already more than 30,000 Internet users participated in the campaign of the organization.
The Bode published the question for the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 persons.
At least eleven per cent, it takes place for legally that the German bank offers a provision for prices for food.
Many bank accounts would also take personal consequences if they recognize that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would notify the review after all the advantages in which the money flows in the red substance speculation.
43 per cent would have taken knowledge from a bank, 49 per cent would have given to think of their account and to change to another institution.
21 house in Vienna
The override Pavillon
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with heights, deep and happy end: The Australian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussels in 1958 was in Vienna to the Museum, stood empty and famous.
Now he will be opened as an exhibition house.
If modern neighborhood architecture is swallowed by clear forms, glass halls, mute smiles and new materials that are typically for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian Pavillon of the Architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition of 1958 is an appropried and happy example.
Swanzers Pavillon received that time the Grand Price d'Architecture for its easy and weak active stahl glass construction.
The building is applied to Meilenstein Time Genesis Architecture.
He made the architects so known that he also built in the next world design of Austria's Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW-Vierizlinderhouse, more shooting Nebenbau in München, he was finally rejoiced in 1973.
His timer exhibition planned Pavillon was established after the World Exhibition in Switzerland Garden at the southern shore, converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20er house" was called it.
The construction was along, but it wasn't pure and technically as the museum - no walls to steal the art, no good climate.
However, it was used so long until the time-week art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the Architec Adolf Krischanitz has converted the Pavillon, now he is called "21th house" and will be used in the future as a museum for the time Genesis art.
It opens the Museum Belvedere, where the house is, where the first exhibition is - a happy case in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Huslein Arco, which was 2007 a new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoting artsthistoriker with considerable carriers u.a. in the young manner, after Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as a founding director of the Museum of the Moderne Salzburg, set the construction in political and mental protectors through the public media and private sponsors and set the use.
Furthermore, the works of the picturehouse Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same stealing, a coffee and a load should be given, and a office should be built to it.
Small view, small state
Then, Krishanitz was the ideal design.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Wien was sensiblely constructed and expanded and wind the competition, but because he studied at Swanzer at the Technical University of Wien and the Pavillon was for him a "unfortunately important place" in which he had seen the exhibition.
He knew the Ur design, and he knew the problems of the building that had already lost in his translation in Vienna and its use in greatness and difficulty.
In this rebuilding, there were larger problems: the building was "un energy slider", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glassface were replaced, used by glassfaser strengthened isolier glass and replaced the glass by special security glass.
Categories are strengthened or replaced, and as best full decks were healed.
Two undercovers brought place for the new use, a declined light grave between house and streets is concerned for the exhibition, a brief leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Swanzer-Pavillon.
The original outdoors have remained, the house has been stretched in the old rostbroun color.
And the kinosal is even exactly as he was before.
And that's all under the strict overseer of the mental authority and with a small eating.
"Oft has to be found a material that is good and nice and also happy to the mental protection room," says Krischanitz, and shows a rude ground in the undercase.
Instead of all constructions, problems and constructions, the building is flexible and easy.
It was hard to be with the Pavillon, "the from Brussels came there," says Krischanitz shortly, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
So a architecture stands "forever on the wrong place" and would like to "reach a correct consciousness."
In this case, the 21th house is not in a false place, because it is a town-building happiness: For the Swedish garden, it is just the completely new planned "Hoofhofsquarters", with officers and households.
And another happy case may be yet: The 21 house may be strengthened by another crishanitz bow, because the Samenen Francesca of Habsburg has buyed the Berlin's timer artist hall, and as you hear, it is already negotiated with the city for a postbarish location in the Switzerland garden.
Bain plants winter crisis package in million heights
The ground has made a crisis plan to prevent the adjustment in the winter.
The number of cooperators should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter conditions of accessories and disorders, Germany's ranks are added to a journal report in this year more than 70 million euros.
The "image" citation was reported priorly by calling to an internal crisis plan until 2015, and investments were totally investments of about 300 million euros.
It should also be obtained a better accessibility of vehicles and smoking networks in extreme wittings.
It is planned, in particular, to be a discharge of internal and external cooperators for the snow-building on bathrooms and bathrooms for 16,000 persons.
The objective is to free the grounds to the beginning and 90 per cent of the employees needed to be freed within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Bahn-header Rüdiger Grube was warned in this winter, after a bridge center with government and industry before accessories and disorders.
In the past winter, the grounds in the transport of persons had several problems, since it was unlikely in difficult weather conditions to reserve.
So many new regional currencies are expected for a permit of the Eastern Fund.
In addition, there is a delay in the ICE training.
The bathroom also makes it clearly needs to check axis of the ICE travels of the workplace after a ICE in the coal had an axis browsing.
The German Bank pays million trains in the United States
After the Tumult on Boss Josef Ackermann, a new disagreement from the United States: The German Bank has to pay a million outside there.
As if the problems were not enough for the German bank, the Branchenrias also have its past in the United States: The Frankfurter Institute paid in a comparison of $145 million (106 million) to contribute to fights for five large community banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of hypothecs.
The Financial Market Tregulier NCUA proposes a total number of large banks to deliver the community banks with false promises to purchase financial products; they had had played the risks.
Such papers are lost during the financial crisis strongly in value and the banks are risked in depth.
"We are satisfied that we could resolve the subject without that the parties should go before the judge," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank had no crime with the comparison.
This is also applied to the cytigroup committed to payment of $20,5 million.
The NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodation of both money houses.
The National Credit Administration of the Union (NCUA) is competent to the US community banks and enters the plots to protect customers.
The NCUA tries to replace the existing billions of challenges.
The currently closed comparations are the first of their type.
The regulatory also had proposed other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the demanding hypothecs papers, it is about such a named Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on household credits.
When the US Immobilienblase 2007 was placed, this was a number of financial companies for detention.
In September 2008, at the high point of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers was killed.
Even if the events have been back for a few years, the banks are currently in the United States a serious wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have not been increasingly intended to receiving or reaching crimes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has solved the largest room.
It's 18 international large banks that two US Immobiliar Financial Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been transmitted at Hypotheken business in the volume of about 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank also needs to be a statement of the FHFA, which is a total of 14,2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurter is justified for "substancial losses" without to call a exact sum.
The German Bank had rejected the requirements as unmanaged and explained to be careful.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett invested strongly into IBM.
Since March, he sold activities in value of more than 10 billion dollars.
At long time, the major American investor Warren Buffett had stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies would only be bad.
But now he has read the business reports of IBM and has changed his opinion on investments in the market.
He has already needed to understand that IBM offers services in particular and create computer systems for IT participation other enterprises.
A investment of Warren Buffett is applied as a ritter in the financial world.
So IBM should now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now fulfilled in the U.S.C.N.B.C.N.B. that he has buyed from March 10,7 billion dollars.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has increased to one of the largest IBM activists with a percentage of 5,5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that he was still in the economic crisis for the right wine.
"You have done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM provides a period of time to the lucrative IT services such as the operation of calculators.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also provides software and consultation as well as companies.
Buffett had technology firms to be broken up.
He says he's only investing in businesses that he also understands.
Instead, Buffet took a buffet even at a smooth board, with a smooth steel or machine builder.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 own daughter companies also parts of a total number of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the previous munchen back.
The 81-year-old age took the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built them with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies of the world.
However, his lifestyle is determined.
That is why he is a cultural figure for innumerable leaders in all the world.
He's nearly increasing mind for money values he has introduced him the name "Omaha orakel".
The IBM activity has increased a percentage after the Buffet Investment.
"Big Blue" as also IBM is also called, it is totally $220 billion in the board and counts it together with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technologies of the world.
With Microsoft, that's what Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get up.
Great Bill Gates is a friend.
The smoking is able to be able
After the detection of the "Zwickauer Cell" two Turkish media in German law.
A newspaper says about a "blood idea", which is now living again.
The murder of eight Turkish and a Greek small employer in the 2000-2006 had a right extremist background.
This message is reacted in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many German tours, there is no comparable violence with the right extremist Background, since the brands in Mölln in November 1992 and in Sollen in May 1993.
This is not a question which is in Germany foreign enemies.
The direct extremistic network, however, shows the measures that the size is not longer absorbable.
"Do you like the bloody idea again?" The Internet issue of the Turkish magazine "Haberturk".
The magazine "Saturday" states that one of the taxers should be a V-Man of the Protection Protection and shows that German authorities may also be developed in the legal radial supply.
Besonen reacted to the Turkish community Germany: She remembered at the weekend with a wheat before the Brandenburgh Tor to the victim of rassist violence.
First two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin was along with German and Turkish politicians in a feast of the fifty-year-day of the German Turkish contract agreement.
In joyful colours, it was incentived each other as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media works as a surface: "The gift of Germany to the fifty" refers to the title of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murderer series.
The German exhibition of "Hurriness" is not allowed to take this thankful connection.
"It's starting to stick," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It indicates that people were killed, paid in charges and had made a important contribution to the Rebuilding Germany with their work.
In German Internet Forces, the police and their later training followers are critically discussed.
Why the German authorities have no longer agreed to seek in the right extremist circles to be amazed, the authors are surprised.
Some show at least rhetoric to drastical means: "When we continue to closing here, the migrants remain nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"For the goodness of the declaration and the approval of all networks is very strong from the internal peace in Germany," says "Selen".
What is that if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the proposals of Mölln and Sollen in the ninety-year years are explained.
The photo of the brandruine of Sollen is depthed in German and Turkish story.
For no other event has shown the living tourists that there is a grievous pain, and the Germans that they can cut off the right violence of miscreasing and distance.
However, the prosecutions raised our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past error
In the Turkish Press, in particular, the report of German policy was decreased after the proposals: Helmut Cohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the branch of Sollen, he sent a steelgram to the Turkish President, but he was in the room of the training room, but from his foreign Ministry Klaus Kinkel - the kidney counted once in his talk how many debts made the ports.
As a result, the value of a person is calculated after the height of his staff.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows again how deep the disagreement of many German citizens is in the highest law.
Besides the efforts of a strong declaration and revaluation of the jurisdictional terrorism in Germany, it needs open words.
The Skandal Bank of Zürsee
The latest European Bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went nearly in the financial crisis and shot it from a crisis to the next.
Now it's going to justify a German.
Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular expenditure from the front of the Budget Bank, he was noted in July that he would attract nearly a new new job: President of the Governing Board of Switzerland, an unexpected and lucrative step of carrier.
Axel Weber was published, the Switzerland praised about her beauty and the UBS about her new soldicity and gave peaceful comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the Turn Round."
"I'm glad of cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grebel."
However, in September, it was clear that everything would come differently.
A UBS handler in London had spent all the bank security systems and run around 1,7 billion euros.
UBS state team Oswald Grübel, not only a Swedish banker, had to go.
The President of the Administrative Council of the UBS is also applied to the attached - and all questions: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was known that Weber could consider the bank from February 2012.
And the President of the Administration has already been taken in May, not only in 2013, as the Bank reported on Sunday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, most economic profile and note banker and had certainly needed a time of operation.
He then takes the responsibility for a bank strategy that has revealed that it is the title of the "the largest scanne bank of Europe".
Because the UBS is a big part - until shortly, she was the greatest manager of the world - and wounded in other ways since years from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, so it seems that the only Sweden bank remains along with.
It started in the financial crisis.
The UBS had an excellent call until 2007.
The image of the differences and solid, but also the exhausted Swedish Administer had composed them with honorable objectives: she also wanted to be a large number in the investment banking.
Thus, the UBS 2007 managed along with $1,6 million more customers than any other world bank.
And on the other hand, she was predicted as a investment bank in the world's largest banks.
That's what it's done.
The only banker and later a long-term bank profile in Zürich Hans Geiger says: "My students have always put the UBS as a model of a good bank."
"But today's look, how could I just be ashamed?"
He was mistaken.
In 2007, it was opened first that something had been raised in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli was surprised, who was mistaken to be as hot hintlelectuals and the same genial bankers.
Some months later, they said why he was gone.
The bank's investment party had been broken with subprise papers and had to write billions.
To promote this, the UBS announced a capital higher and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, they found investors, however, of which some had been spoken to the nase before: an intransparency Asian State Fund from Singapore and a Arab State Fund that had not found its name once.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The Bank had to notify the new billion losses, President Marcel Ospel, 2006, even the Sweden best payed administrative Council.
In October 2008, the Catastrophe followed: The UBS was in view of their fehlin vestings in the financial crisis before the construction and had to be saved from the State.
The National Bank was buying the UBS for hundreds of billions of problems, the Switzerland's ownership gave six billion franks for a weak transitional training on which they could be able to be the bank's middleman.
The entire Switzerland was shot - because she noted how dramatic it is for a small country when there is so large banks.
Finally, the balance sum of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as larger as Switzerland's economic leadership (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher.
At the first catastrophe, the second ended.
A few months ago, the UBS captured the UBS in the office with America and declared it ready to expose the data of employed customers that may have gone through the bank officers.
In addition, it was a payment of 780 million dollars – as a reward of unjustly winning from these businesses and a crime.
In order to recognize the UBS more or less open to help the steering rate.
Eventually, she lost something since her capital was in competition about rich customers: the Nimbus of the Diversity.
After the scandal, the Switzerland's bank secret was not the same.
It followed the return of the Board and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of customers.
So the Bank had lost their credibility in two central business areas within a few months: in the investment bank through false speculations and in the management of the management by the assistance to steel reduction.
And just when there was something more quiet, just as you thought, now the UBS will reach it again, so this unseen handler story is followed: a individual handler cuts 1,7 billion euros before the bank knows that something is slow.
And it is clear: with the risk management in the investment bank, it is obviously not yet.
"In the case of Adoboli, you have to determine that the risk control has changed too much," says Martin Janssen, Economy and Financial Professor in the University of Zürich.
The financial presence of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that she does not have the risk control."
It was exactly the idea of the care that the Switzerland bankers had been attached for a long time to become the heroes of the great benefits of the world: no very big risks for money - they also wanted to cut the world together from the Alpen Republic.
The Swiss bank tresors became the symbol of unrespective permissions such as Lindt and Springglas for special old schools.
The Centre of the UBS in Zürich is still applied to the cles of the Switzerland's private bank - she is only a little bigger.
Although the situation is classical.
The Bank has seen its main seats at the Zürichian border street that leads directly from the main shore to the Zürich Sea, which is cut down by the snow-sheeps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are clearly, the ladenmits are the most highest in Europe.
Juveliers like Tiffany's are found here between Switzerland's traditional works like the Confidency Sprungengli.
Since centuries, the Switzerland banks are resident here: from the National Bank on the Palast of the Sweden to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS's Account Hall is in a severe trip.
Inside, the walls are clothed by marmor, so they are a lot of leaders, beside the bank logo, a great indication to "safe".
The UBS knows what the client looks here: security.
These ideas of the Switzerland Bank have both Switzerland's large banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, but sometimes disappeared - or advertised as the head of a small private bank finds.
His name would not like to read in the magazine, finally makes, as all Swedish bankers, as well as the two large bank businesses.
The UBS has become too large, especially in the investment bank, where the angels acids were expanded.
The Switzerlands had nothing to say there.
"And if, they have been adapted to the sites of angels across."
In fact, it was the angle investment bank that changed the UBS, you only protected high wine, and then the Debakel: No European financial institution has lost so much money as the Switzerland's big bank.
On 15 October 2008, the Catastrophe was visible.
"In this midnight, the Government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the greatest saving action in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hessig in his book "The UBS-Crash."
Before 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, the politicians urged to save the big bank before the bank.
How could it come to this?
If you talk to Switzerland banks, they see the problem in particular in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Switzerland's large banks were joined together with a mighty concert.
There was a bank that had already been too big in the Fusion for the small Switzerland - and still grow.
It helped that the two different UBS banks were fulfilled: a rich, but the bank sleeped with the severe power management in Zürich and a seriouser, but has already been stronger internationalised.
Finally, the internationalized investment banks came good to a lot of money with which they could turn a serious advice.
Two names are linked to this upgrade of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Concern Chef of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, the President of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says the bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-level cults, beauty that understand many of models and statistics, and Ospel, the Battleman who has worked from the bank league to the top."
But Ospel has left up on the wuffli.
And Wuffli's probably made a decisive error at the end, "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragedy case."
Tragical, maybe.
It's clear that the surface has come before the case.
The UBS cooperators are clearly reminded of the manager's meetings, on which Concern Chef Wuffli always gave the same parole: Goldman Sachs from the Thron.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.
She led the "League Tables", the range lists who reported the success of the banks in that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps she had already been happy.
In the devise business and in the acting trade, she played it entirely up.
However, the companies who have been supplied have a difficulty: In the international employment, in the banks language "Fixed Income", there is a large distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has skins in American hypothecs products.
In order to close these laughs, UBS became an adventure that she at least costed the existence.
Increasingly, the bank was invested as well as one of its based hedge funds in American subprises.
She developed a powerful machine, the value papers on American hypothecs credit and continued - but also maintained risks.
Even as other banks are looking for the expenditure.
"But in Saturday 2007, when the American immobiliar market was in flammen, the UBS has buyed there," says the bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
A manager had to go after the other than trying to drop more difficult than I thought.
Posts in the UBS were at the slider session and are warned until today.
He who leads the big bank now has a nearly impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has all the nearby business models.
Bank researcher has already a idea: concluded with the investment bank, concentration on the administration, return to the Switzerland roots.
The bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment bank should be strongly broken, so much now is clear.
On the next Sunday, the New Bank Chef Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Sweizer was actually just thinking as a transitional solution when the bank was surprised by the proceedings.
At the mid-term time, he continued to lead the UBS businesses, shared with the Zürichian Bank on Sunday.
Hermotti wants to return the investment bank at the middle of the ninety years.
3500 places are stretched.
But it won't be rich.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to pay for money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure now.
Of course, he says only for a time, he will only look for a place in Zürich with his wife.
Next year.

The one of them that others want to quickly disappoint them: forces are from centuries to the city picture, but in many communities, a lot of communities of residents have freighted themselves on smokes and dreams of animals.

Management researchers of the University of Cambridge tested at least four hours, as long as the intelligence of birds is sufficient.

Mass smoking on a personal level
Emotionally and greatly started Peter English's new book "Beauty and fear. A story of the First World War, speaks in ninety-shirts" with a long list of main persons who go to heart.
Here is a hint of how you can do: Put this page carefully and make it to your bookmarks.
They will learn these people in English very well, and these main persons will be working as your GPS, as a light turm in these few moments, in which you are lost like English men and women in the nebel of war and your illusions are disappointed.
Peter England is a Swedish history and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Sweden Academy, which determines the Nobel Price for Literature.
He wrote an incompatible book that he doesn't describe "the work of the anti-histories".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous shots. There are no news, racial reporters or discussions about taktic and exploitation.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but more than "a book about how it was." It's called "beats, instructions, experiences and rules."
"Beauty and fear" nearly the war experiences of 20 or less vulnerable men and women together on both sides of the war, from schools and botanics to mountains, doctors, car cars and officers.
Some of these people will be held.
Some will be taken into prison, losing members, crazy or dead.
Each of this life is flackered as the voticulars in a church, some come to go, while others remove.
The English book is important from the normal story books.
It also corrected the imagination that the First World War was only the dominant position war at the Westfront.
"Beauty and fear" turns out with experts on other war visions: the alpen, the Balkan, the Eastfront, Mesopotamia, the East Africa.
At the soldiers in this book, a feast night between the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets flows are an unsolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a movement book.
The war survives the life of these people as a natural catastrophe, such as a Hurrican Katrina, who leads to Cordite.
Consider that you are a woman who is home with their children, and canon fire in the remote. Stay or get the flight?
Who's coming?
Unless someone understands what happens or why this war is leaving.
"Free facts," says English, "words with suffering, acceptance, hope, despite, fixed ideas, discovery theory, dreams, alphabets and rooms."
"Beauty and fear" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English sister in Russian Army, and Richard Stuff, a young German shipmaster.
Their stories were mainly included reminders, letters and others already published.
Their life reports may be terrible or amazing, but they are extremely living in English of the small collection lost in detail.
Many of them do missing and looking for help.
In the history of a German schools, he says, "Replacement, all replacement."
"Example coffee, false aluminium, false radiergummy, paper-binding, tree buttons."
He tells more about replacements in Germany.
He describes: "The flesh that made out of printed road and was busted in the hammerfett (and last was served with a false bottom of wood), Tabak, which was made out of broken roots and shoes of cartoffles, shoes that were made with wood."
It was, as he noted, "837 registred food consumption allowed in the manufacture of rubbers, 511 coffee equipment."
Some story are acting of honor and integrity.
One American recognizes his own threat to wildness and says about the war, "Man feels that it is all that it was proposed for men than to sit in the middle table, with the evening, the best shelter, and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and as to do, as a fashiony civilization, and as no barbarians were strengthened behind their own own and killed the hedgebrust."
In turn, a British soldier recognizes that he's probably dead, and no one takes notice of it or will be concerned.
"If you take a distance from the thought of offering yourself, you want to think that this happens before a publication," he wrote.
Instead of that, it is so terrible as "a judged man who has been held in secret."
Other observations are taken from the Old Europe, which falls out of each other, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict was excited to a economic concurrence," writes English, "a war between the manufacturers."
He begins to admit what he calls "a new species in the establishment of the youngest century," "the word has turned and ideally convinced a mass killer in the massage, who kills while he sits behind a board."
People belong to unprepared types and ways and there are also free behavior like heroism.
In England, the soldiers who were actively trying to achieve themselves with a prostitute with a sexual disease to get out of the front service.
"The great expression of this can be detected in the trade with Gonocoke Eeting, because soldiers buyed and suffered in their genitalies, in hope to come into the hospital," wrote he.
"The ones who were really disappointed, brought him into the eyes of what they brought to them that they were blind of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Anglunds Poesie will be smile and immediately attached to his human task.
In thousands of small scenes, he begins the way and way as the war "determined in an uncontrolled way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hass."
People begin to ask why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were most worse like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans such as Erich Maria Remarques "Im Westen nothing News" as great story books.
The Inglaterra band has an unconventional holiday room.
His book has the most famous end of which I've ever read in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's like he had taken us the page with his book with the main persons before the nase and made us a train wood.
After a previous missing a minute planned attack
Third hundreds of police officers were participated, and some of them were carried out.
You had decided for the evening of Monday, because in this time nobody are in Zucotti Park.
The operation was held secretly, and only few higher employees were informed. All others believed starting to participate in a training.
President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his existence understood the fact that the operation was fully required.
The events of the past weeks such as the introduction of Pfefferspray against protesters, which rejects the rules of the declaration, and the households had a great growth in public sympathies, had no longer needed to repeat.
And then the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Cuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and education.
These officers were prepared by observing how conditions were maintained in other cities.
A catastrophe was found in place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
The employees strengthened the chaos-shopping measures for terrorism fighting, as well as the quick training of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit found Montagnag on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter into the park came "In the last minute," said a man who trusted with the commands, which he said for a declaration as a "declaration".
"The little police who had been associated with my science didn't know that it was about the customer Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Cuccotti Park were the highest officers of the restaurant."
A reason for the secret was a lecture learning the city.
On October 14, the officers wanted to dream the park, but they turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they found these plans.
Different policy units were participated in the operation of the Sunday, including usecommandos from the whole city - hundreds of mobile employees that are usually used in high crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people in the park and get out, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park," he said.
Saving cars with jupiter lamps and sounds were prepared before the shipping at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded messages that were raised from the sound speakers seemed to be watching many protesters.
When the public officers entered their light blue windjacks in the park, many protesters just reported their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 hours there would be no self-offs to give the protesters time to pack their hate and good together.
Other teams of officers have been seen how they collected in the environment to enter into force should be needed in the park.
Reporters were required to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the President of the police, said that it had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists believed that they wanted to stop watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the course of the offices was very far.
Mr. Browne said that the Fernseh cars in the Church Street could make photos on the west side of the Park.
When the police in the west direction were moved by the large training on the personal matters of the protesters, including the coffee, the Kunstras, and the tickets with clothes, followed their locations of the city purchase, which was left.
Some protesters who refused to go were burned outside, and images appeared shortly in the Internet.
A protestist headquarter is near the kitchen area of the laser in the centre of the park position.
Some have made barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Circa 10 people in the epicenter of the ship were joined to their arms.
And two people smoked themselves in the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
The officers of the Castrop Protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, there were no prisons in the park until 3:30.
The room was completed after the police's exhibition after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 persons were set in the park.
The majority of prisons came as he said, because of "incompatible business and resistance against a festival."
The prominant office was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the division, the highest uniformed employees of the division.
Phil T. Pulaski, department team of the criminal officers, was also there.
Instead of his existence, Mr. Kelly, "the operation is not", as Mr. Browne said.
For the case they should access, a second group of employees at the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortland Street, a street block in the north of the Park, and in the Pine Street, a block continuously south, Barricades were created.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continued to spread the circuit around the Cuccotti Park.
In one place, there were observed as many officers, many of them with protectors, driving people outside.
Circa 28 people were in the north circuit.
Some of the most vulnerable actions of the night found in the south of the Park.
At 5 hours in the south of the Pine Street a protester on the board of a police vehicle and other demonstrants left the air from the riff of a police.
In one place, the lots rolled a piece of shirt.
At the end, a employer and a protester came to the hospital.
The manufacturer's operation will be reached by solutions against the city.
The company, the hundreds of school employees who have lost their workplace last month, plans to discover the city on the middle-second, because the solutions are not necessary and discriminatory because of their disagreements on schools who teach the poor students.
It is probably the last opportunity that the business, the Conservative Council, 37, in their efforts to reject the solutions, even open.
Seventy-seven-seven-seven-seven-shirt-shirt-coordinators, and other employees who were the best paid in the city and lost their work on 7 October in a shop, the business manager as a political rate for that the last year of the city had refused to access to a health fund under the work groups, with which the budget should be concluded.
These accusations were rejected by the authorities.
On the audience of the town Council, Dennis Walcott, director of schools, in the past month, the solutions were part of the budget that you have agreed in June.
A member of the town Council fell back and explained him that there was nothing specific in the budget that the employees would be released by school assistance.
The officers of the town Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of education before a plan. On Middle Wednesday, it will be given a press conference on which the income to the Supreme Court in Manhattan is formally published.
Mr. Walcott and the Education Ministry of the city will be raised as boards and count eight launched workers as customers who are all colored or Latin American women, such as most of the helpers who lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city does not prejudice, and therefore it could not be commented to their individual consciences.
According to the New York Times, the company has focused on the number of solutions in schools in the poor quarters of the city to support a balance because of an equal treatment. She believes that poor schools have lost more helpers because they were chronicly undertaken.
She says that while there are no solutions on State Island and only few solutions in the schools of the East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school held in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx district.
With the definition of the loss of five of eight schools who were established in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of the students lived in poverty, the claims: "This is no neighborhood parents who can organize shops to take up budgets."
P.S.: The budget of 36. District has been carried on 3,26 per cent this year. Moreover, money was lost as the city changed their calculation method for extra financing for each army school inscription.
The company also noted that the leaders of High Schools were guided by languages in a memo in the Irre, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (the German: translation) to the United States usually the change of a teacher from the list of a school in a pool available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-sixteen control coordinators have been deleted, not transmitted," said the draft design.
Mission ended, the Congress prepared to comprehend Libya
Finally, it seems like Republicans and Democrates in Washington to understand the resorts in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the Revolts, the arrest and murder of the long-year Dictor Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American emergency.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate decides a resolution that supports the President John Kerry (Massachussetts) with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Loverman (Connecticut), where Libyen is able to rebel the successful rebellion and the US forces for their "Mut".
"This resolution honors the humble people of Libyen who have started with the rebuilding of their country," said Kerry.
"They is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts through two parties."
The language likes to sing innocent, but it wasn't just in the Libya's girlfriend.
In this room, two parties and the white house are striking on the selection of a number of resolutions on the implication or miscreasing of the role of the US Military in the Liberia Mission of the NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain proposed a resolution which approved the limited use of military powers of the United States in Libya.
The law was denied in the Senate by a wide border group of both parties, and there was no vote.
However, at the same day, this law fell through in the Senate, and the room was also exceeding a decision to cut out the money for American operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. Mission was in a kind of legal fire - with a congress that had been made enough to criticize Obamas in the field of the mission, but not enough to put out the ground under the feet.
Then the infiniteness of the Congress has been achieved by the events.
Tripolis fell in August among the Libya Rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO Mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the senate may be ready to trade.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulations the people of Liberia with their great strength and their extraordinary extent in their self-free liberty" and "living the men and women of the United States Army and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary strength and their professionality."
The resolution also ensures "the national interests of the United States to a successful and increasing transition of Liberia to Democracy".
Do the new measures receive full support by the Greece for Foreign Relations or will they spread the lawyers as the law has done by June?
The last stage is the resistance of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen Republicer of the Committee.
Lugar's Sprecher said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final statement of the new law.
According to the Chapter, this week is to apply this week on a constitutional amendment requesting an explicit budget, a high priority at nearly every Congress Legislation period of the Republicans and some democrates.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or another area that comes to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawyers have already tried to take their changes to vote, although they have often tried it enough.
Goodlatt's change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and a full broadcast of the subjects.
Some are doubled - the same law has been submitted to the Congress and the Senate - others only disappeared easily from each other.
There are only 15 versions of comparison changes and another thousands that would control the "country expenditure" in the Senate.
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their tasks - especially the republicans who want to promote their lives - the opportunity to praise that they have such a "face" measure.
The budget control system adopted in August requires that the Senat and the Congress may be amended by a change of the budgetary equality.
In March, 58 Senators have voted for an unbinding resolution that supports the idea of this amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that can present members of the Congress, while the Republican Joseph E. Serrano (New York) wants to exalte the limit on two offices of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that ensure the right to a good education and health.
An amendment offering a marriage under the same parent is also like a change that causes the consumption of branches, a continually returning template.
Certain lawyers also want to ensure that contracts are rejected if two of the States denied them.
As long as the members proposed amendments, they move as faster as in the past years.
In the 111. Congress, the lawyers 77 proposed such amendments in 110. 66.
The time is expired in comparison with the last 1990-year-old years, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two-year years, as the numbers available to the Senat Library.
But they were not much successful than today.
The last amendment added is - the 27th - was ratified 1992, but it was actually proposed to the Congress for 1789.
"Founded, but not invisible," so giords in the first television view after the attention
Ten months after a weaponsed man from the next distance in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gibfords (Arizona) was opened in the national TV. She only sang the Broadway ticket "The Sun Will come out Tomorrow" and said, the desire to get to get, is greater than the one who returns to the congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20", she turned to words and needed help to go.
The sentence showed the severe sustainability of the pain that has set the bullets that divided their skins, the left side of their brain, and has passed his head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisedly to the Congress to repeat their voice to sin.
In their first television view after the attention in January, when six people were killed and 13 were slaughtered, smiled, laughed and blood - and described their genius as "different."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, he replied: "All right."
The interview with Hyord and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a single "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the new book of the marriage was published: "Gabby: a story about the pain and hope."
The Special Prosecution of Guiords Genesing since the Attention of 8 January.
In videos, Kelly recorded in the first week, you see it in the hospital bedroom, with a hair rased head and a long shale over the stress.
She can only have one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
Moon later, Guiords sits in a role role, while therapeuts show you how she runs easy moves.
A nick with the head.
A kitchen with the lips.
Then, their first words, "What?"
After a few days, Guords flew another word: "Toast". You want to change your birthday.
Videos played in the ABC-Show show that music played an important role in Girords' Genesing: You see how the congress agreed together with the therapeuts in Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin" singing.
In the interview with Sawyer said Guyords, two hours each day with therapy, that she can't remember at the day of the attention.
Her husband said that he had mentioned an article on 12 March on a day period about the attention when she was interrupted and first asked the six people who were killed during the attention.
The Must Protection Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and will be treated medically while he waits for his treatment.
"More people are dead," said Guyords Sawyer.
"Hard, heart, heart."
During the gift of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was found."
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you didn't have been visited?", said Kelly.
You've just been found.
And you'll keep it, and you'll get it, and you'll come back stronger than ever before.
Armies receive more comfort than respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gala, which collected millions of dollars for unreachable veteranes in New York City.
Kid Rock sings a ballade on helplessness, frustration and loss.
At a name, hundreds of soldiers, matrixs, pilots and mariners gathered around him.
The number of black smokings was up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as held," said David Saltzman, who organized the spending in the early year.
A higher military officer on the gala, which was observed by the staff and the president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops different.
"They were introduced as weaven children," the officer wrote in a mail.
I'm sure the organizators have made it good.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not, it was comfortable.
The fractures of the contrary income illustries the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes a wonderful American publicity.
The troops will be overcome with lob for their victims.
But the honour has his price, says the officer.
The public is aware of how you do the people in uniform pain.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, the army in Iraq ordered and soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems to be the only way of supporting those who are to press us into the role of unfaithful souls."
The subject is extremely significant for military leaders that appear not inacceptable or in battle with the public that they want to serve.
They also recognized that the weight that the returned forces were struck in the last years of the Vietnam war was worse.
As follows, talks about comforts in silence and privacy between military veterans are in place.
After his two sons returned from battle with the marine, the Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people could see their service outside the military world from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a feeling of fear, because they were visiting rebels and were directed to exotic places.
Others would ask whether a "which, violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who had fighted in Iraq, and after his return, a higher state cost in Washington.
During his workshop, he said, he felt that some of the questioners were submitted to ask whether he was in the situation, even after his return from the battle to the pressure of a requested poster in Washington.
"When you speak about your service, you should keep the negative instructions," said Cancian, his sons.
The missing length of the soldier is a part of the missing interest of the Americans in war.
Guides on the field are made by a country that has little experience with the military and only few benefits in the fighters in Iraq and in Afghanistan, just as a lob of lob.
"We, as a nation, don't appreciate military held anymore as it was absolutely in the Second World War," said the leader of General David Barno a.D., the US groups in Afghanistan.
Instead of this, the honor of political and publicity is focused on the suffering of a service member.
The troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have taken, the number of friends they have lost or the weakness of their losses.
The military is the growing pressure for severe controls in administration
In this week, a major hearing decides whether 28 women and men are approved by non-introduction in an administration before the military Court.
If it does not come, hundreds of claims are ready for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week, when she was organized by a soldier colleague night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her caserne in Miramar, north of San Diego from the evening with a friend when she came to a man's colleague who brought a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he had to join her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm blogs came up," said Lyman.
But the Texasners wanted their minds to take place.
I thought, "Ah, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wanted that I had heard of my busy feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind them, pressed them down and washed them, saying.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military arrangements expected a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which a plan will be made to be allowed against the previous Ministry of Protection Robert Gates and his proceedings, Donald Rumsfeld.
The plan is that Gates and Rumsfields have not been made against the long-term administration within the military and under the destruction of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a law law law official officer from Washington, D.C., included the shipment at the beginning of 17 customers, but in the following months increased to 28: 25 women and three men who all believed that they were evacuated or missed sexually, and that the military soldier was dismissed to judge it, or to make a adequate right to dispose of the respective attacks.
Burke says she follows the highest military execution because the problem begins there.
"The soldier has been built hierarchy," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to exceed the culture's payment?
Burke also says that she has contacted about about 400 more survivors since February, many of them may be part of the future.
Their strategie: Instead of putting their eggs into a corb, they will, if necessary, get many other balances to reach the pressure.
The team of protection for the Ministry of Defence, introduced by Neil MacBride, has made a request to decline.
The acts of the Court, which are present in the newsweek, are explicitly attached to the Defence Strategy, in the first line that the military can not be approved from the present or previous soldiers for destructions, to which it has come into the battle forces.
In accordance with a law of the Supreme Court from 1950, which is called Feres Doctrine, the Government does not appeal to disagreements that are added to military soldiers in the active service.
"The Muslim Disasters have been achieved during the military service of the customers," said the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses every comment to this history.
These things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the difference is only in the name: modern wars have only clear reasons.
As well as in Iraq and in Afghanistan, groups of soldiers play more important roles, especially in contact with home women in war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two third parts of them in battle.
It's at the time the military will be modernized, says Burke.
And it is not only in its fight, but three other fights except them are dependent.
In the Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a construction against the four major military rakadamis because of the mutual promotion of a frau-enemic atmosphere.
Independently, the combined Vietnam Veterans of America collects a war against the military, in which you concentrate on the diagnosis of "Personal Destruction", the victims received to leave them out of the service - a regular procedure as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a group of human rights.
Its group was raised in December, against Veteran Administration (e.g.: Management of War Veterans), where they had their discriminatory practices in their course with supplied requests for persons who were provided to be sexually misused in the service.
Thirteen laws were independently provided by a mixing of Senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress offering a number of tract points.
The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (including: Office for Prevention and Prevention of Sexual Missions) of the Defence Ministry 3.158 sexual mistakes.
However, most of the mistakes are not reported, and after their own appreciation of the pentagon, this number is about 13,5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes for year.
The report published in March also investigates the crime supply rates: 2010 has been 20 per cent of the most experienced cases in the military court, only half as many as civil rights.
The claimers in Burkes case describe their attacks as only the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the mutual administration of the military policy less than one hour after the accident.
In this night, she said, she was 11 times requested to tell the details of their administration of a total number of police, doctors and commanders.
She was found in her bed a lawyer and the blood of her advocator who was driving out of a snippet to her arm.
Six months later, April 2009, Lyman was attracted by a judge. During that audience, she was asked after the sex she had been in charge with her friend.
Six people said to be characteristic products in the name of the Muslim Tattoo, which finally was free.
"I remember the day when the judgment was readed," said Lyman.
"I thought the weights would be used, I cried out of the Court."
"They brought me into the psychiatric division, and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my comandant, "I wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was requested to investigate a military psychiater who finally diagnosed a person's disorder and explained it for service.
In January 2010, she was declined impressively, so that she had no support.
Whether the ship that Lyman and the other officers have committed is clean speculation, says John Turley, Professor of law science at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "After my view, they should be proceeded."
What is between them and a jurisdiction is this doctor who is criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a criticism of the Feres Doctrine.
The soldier takes a decade behind, because they don't have the same accommodation and the same scary that brings a deal with him.
He adds: "The chances are against them, but it's important for them that they're trying."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the law law officer of the customers, begins with its hundreds of other assaults for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the soldier in this regard until it comes to reform."
Or until we die, whatever happens as the first.
walls have eyes: How to watch researcher on Facebook
Before he became a new face of the law extremism in Europe, Andres Behring Brevik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-education assembly online.
On Monday, Brevik, who had been able to attend an attempt in Norway in July, who was killed by 77 people, was his first public hearing before the judgment.
Although Brevik had been treated alone, he is not alone in Cyberspace: He has passed a lot of time before his computer, and with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this sommer, researchers wanted to find more about these people.
But how do you find her?
It's easy - you just need to log in on Facebook.
"We have determined that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report of the British idea factor DEMOS about the digital popularisme in Europe.
Facebook's hidden personal data is so encyclopatic, Bartlett says that the researchers need to use the tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with science equipment - as the marketers do since years.
Bartletts team found a half million fans directly extreme groups in all Europe and then showed them with Adds, but instead of linking a new band or a new dial product, added Adds users to a question in which they were asked after their education, their behaviour against violence and the estimation of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were in the situation to ask more than 10,000 attachers of 14 outside the right party in 11 European countries - unless they only had to leave their office once.
"It's a right new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprised. Online officers are most young, men and worried about immigration .
But in a surprising way, "the ones who combine their online activity with a offline activity, more democratic and less vulnerable than those who are sitting behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is only a example for how Facebook will become a new named tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideen factors, medical researchers and policy scientists use the page to study everything from health issues to society, such as in "Likes, text messages and status updates".
With more than 800 million active users, adding three contents per day, Facebook's "DatenSupernova" generates a wood of research that increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title in the last five years about 800%.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is the fact that you can study people through this side that usually do not get their clipboard on the street.
"When you were trying to ask people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first report the party and they had never given them a future," said Bartlett.
"Facebook's falling all this -- you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page provides a possibility to recognize and resolve social health problems.
A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues have discovered that students who discussed their full course on Facebook are significantly stronger to the problem drinks than students who drowned on this subject.
Moreno suggests that similar students, for example, watch the site, and help a student if they are posted to a lot of status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," said Dimitri Christaxi, Morenos Ko-auteur and Leader of Child Health, Behaviour and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found a chance to identify dangerous children who wouldn't be found otherwise."
Facebook also applys the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has established statistics on the relationship status and Valentine Day, choice participation to the Middle Selections 2010 and a national happiness index (which is used in the first line of data that only has been used to Facebook - Master of digital freedom knows long since the page should make their large data groups access to other research.)
However, the Facebook users know that the page watchs them if they want it or not. To be remoted with a friend, a thousand miles, can play Scrabble, the page allows you to carry out their own personal data.
But what if the Facebook users are part of a question that they don't know anything again?
While researchers have set direct directives as they collect their data offline, all are allowed online.
"I don't believe that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a socialologist in London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006, where he investigated the public pages of students on Facebook.
"What she concerns, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of the methodic.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook are two totally different things," says Selwyn.
So Selwyn thinks about its years as technical researchers that a clipboard and a stage are still the best research tools that can use each one.
"No replace to go into the real world and speak to real people," he says.
"Social research must be careful about the social, and every lot of social life still is still offline."
"Kat and inhuman": Anders Behring Brevik appears first before a public court
And others Behring Brevik, the man who stood two amokrates who were killed in this room in Norway 77 people, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "whispers" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movie and a Temple of Norway," he said before a Court of Justice with more than 500 people.
"I am excited to the judgment because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting hassideology and because multiculturalism is supported."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't confess myself."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim broke Brevik during this monolog because he "Brevik didn't want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Brevik, who made an explanate word to the permission to return to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also agreed that the police Brevik has a number of more 12 weeks in investigation, and he has no access to the media, and he said that the authorities will be fully controlled and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
At least 30 survivors and victims participated in the audience.
Some came in the hope of seeing Brevik in the eyes, others wanted to ensure that he remained behind the lock and the ring.
Everyone took part of the objective that everything goes out to a closer.
"I thought he'd act cold and inhuman," said a supervivent from Utoya to the northern NRK senter.
"It was unbelievable, but it's a piece for me after I saw and heard."
Brevik brought a dark smoke and a blue cravate and worked during all the hearing, quiet and professional. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left it again.
Although Brevik's weird evidence, he would be part of a larger "which states" movement, the judge came to conclude that he wasn't sick and said there was no evidence that he had compliance.
Some may like that the attacks of 22 July appeared to be the work of a single extreme, and not of a group of radicalers.
But does this automatically improve the coach and the disagreement that a whole nation still feels?
"I wanted him to look like a monster, but he doesn't do that," said the relatives of a victim.
"It would be so easier if he did it."
7 Lections of the Interview with the dead Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compared him with Henry Ford and highlighted the technology as a great modern finder.
However, what Apple-Fans may find at the end of the latest discovered job interview, which has been established in this week before special film implementations on the important markets, is how much this creative head process and work process has understood.
He was sure a designer, a dreamer, and himself named Hippie, but he was also a aribic organizer, who was able to build in diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders were threatened to the "the illness of the thought" that a really great idea of the work... [but] there is a great quantity in the trade business between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Fachidiotes" on the breakdown of the personal computer. He sat longer than one hour together with jobs, where they led one of the different, detailed conversations.
At this time, it was about 10 years ago since the jobs had been broken from Apple, and he had already worked hard on his new computers NeXT, and he enjoyed the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's Interview was used in fachidios, he says that the copies of the Interview schemes were missing in the transfer.
First after Job's death, you discovered a complete VHS copy in the Garage of the Director.
This easy transformed film is the base for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: the lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark's Theatre.
For someone who knows that he declares detailed interviews, Jobs are surprised in the explanation of his technological philosophy and business strategys.
And incrediblely.
In the interview, there are four times longer pauses between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds afters, where the job is clearly disturbing his thoughts and tried to justify.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes in days when he seems indulgently responds to Cringely's questions and encourages him to quickly enter the subjects or follow-ups of greater significance.
Before Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears in secretly widely when Job assessssing what other companies do right or wrong his opinion and shows its own vision to the future of the computer.
It's a thing to read posthume convictions of the Carrie's jobs, but the job here is to see as the dreams that are on the dream of greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision how the things could be and should be.
Soon after he did all these things here, he went out and did it.
A fast view on seven observed sequences of lost interviews:
As he learned to lead a company:
"Why do you do things?" and the answer that you always get is, "Oh, then it will be done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I've seen it.
Jobs continue to rationalise the letter in Apple.
As regards how costs were recorded - mostly, you started with "standard costs", which were paid to the only consciousness and then applied with the "degradation" - he developed a automatised factory that ensures that the costs could be determined until the smallest.
How the pattern was denied:
Jobs says about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could driving into the phone society and talking to telephone.
The device has already been written a lot of things, but Job's distress when he describes the Blue Box as a act of self-autorisation.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a boxing phone, calling and then connecting from a AT&T network to another, while many satellites sleep as possible.
"We sent things a half thousand times around the Globus and when you grew in the phone, it came a minute later in the phone nearby," said Job's kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something to control billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world."
We both knew not much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lecture, and I don't think it would give it without them Apple.
Jobs says more about a gloria streach, the Wozniak, and he went nearly when they called in the middle of the night through Blue Box in Vatican and wanted to talk to the Papst, while they could see Henry Kissinger.
Since several Catholic Jeremy members were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomates, the two had to leave before the father himself came to the phone.
As he loved in the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
In the age of 12, when he looked for replacements to build a frequency number, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Short after her 20-minute phone phone jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-packard.
"It was the only company I saw in the age, and it formed my views about what a company was and how good it had treated his partners."
Afterwards, Jobs were one of the HP workers who visited the research labour in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer, which has ever been produced."
He was so big as a coffee, there was a small screen with brunch rings, and I loved me in him.
I'd like to move up to the HP as a teenager and write to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Multiple times in the Interview Jobs says how spontan finds new products.
It was early in his carrier when he built a few plastics, he was asked by a client to build the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider the collection and the delivery of the remote devices.
After Apple, he remembers the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember transplanting arguments... you write me that it would be five years to build [to build a mouse that would cost 300 dollars] and I stand up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, that was incredible.
Over large companies that allow:
Long before he resume Apple, Jobs saw the ways that many industry guarantees have raised with their visions in Stolpern and lost control on their actions.
"We say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing a better copyer or printer, and?"
They have the activity monopol, so the company is not successful.
Selling and marketing makes it successfully, so [with such people] who finally lead the company and the product with which people are taken from the finding of decision.
The product genius that has led to this monopolation will be broken by people who have no concept in respect of good products, including bad products, needed to be manufactured.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have obtained the whole computer industry.
You could be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s could be...
You have raised the deadline of the vig.
About innovation as artwork:
"It's all a lot of business works between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn much about his enemies.
You must take votes, some things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, manufacturers.
You need to know 5000 things, these concepts, and they all together...
Lastly, it comes to the challenge, it comes out that you are trying to make yourself with the best witness that people have created, and then try to join these things to what they do.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, the great artists claim.
We're always amazing in the steel of great ideas.
The part of the Macintosh did greatly, was that people who work there, musicians, dinners, artists, zoologists, history, who are the best computer scientists of the world.
If it wasn't the computer branch, they would make great things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinners with health health care, as a case accepted by the Court
On the day when the Supreme Court gathers closed doors to discuss the political party question, whether the health care of President Obama is addressed, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner who was spoken by the candidate, that the case was sent before the judgment.
The event was found in the past Sunday when all nine judges came to a conversation to consult the patents to test.
One of the cases to be treated was a case that 26 states had increased against the long-term health reform of the past year of the Congress, a law that had been made to be raised in the United States with conservative activities.
The judges were listed to the audience. In fact, on March, a 5 1/2-time basis discussion will be expected, which, likely, will be cursed by the Chairman of 2012, which will be completely recognised at the date of which the Court shall be recognised.
The law is likely to be Paul Clement, the lawman who stands before the Court and will say that the law is to cut off, is likely to be Paul Clement, the only Secretary-General Agency under the Government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzley, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two thousand companies supporting the annual dinner of the Federalist society, an older group that enforces the protection of conservative law principles.
Another company that the dinner sponsored, Jones Day, represents one of the economic companies, the National Federation of Independent Business, which began the law.
Another sponsor was the Pfizer Inc., which was greatly involved in the result of the process.
The dinner found a few hours after the court had consulted the case, in an Washington Hotel.
In addition, Mitch McConnell, the Fractionary Chief of the Republican in Senat and a clearly clearer of the health reform.
The guests of the dinner?
This is nothing new: the two judges have visited the events of the federal society since years.
And that doesn't make sense against moral rules.
In fact, the judges are free from the treatment codex, which regulates the actions of the underlying agreement judges.
If they would have fallen under the principle 4c of the Codex, which says: "A judge can participate in laws and other organizations, where the judges can not be speakers, honour guests or programmes.
The extreme near Scalia and Thomas reached out to two of the cancers related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to warn moral and governing activities.
"This famous brochure with Moral and the Codex's adjustment punishes some judges lying, the Court holds the same rules that apply for all other contracting judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a citizenship movement in the United States.
"The judges won and died during a employment establishment with law-wide officers with severe procedures in the Court."
Your achievements and their support of a speednavigation for this processing are submitted to the independence and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little attention to critics that say that they would be easy to judge with groups that lead themselves from the agenda, such as the federal society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a known conservative activist.
The conservatives said that there was a judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general State officer under the Government of Obama, when the first legislation in the first instance came before the Court.
Their critical crisis, Kagan, requested to take back from the audience of the case, because they were very engaged in the protection of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make any advantages to do this.
Boeing offers records of 18 million dollars in country
Emirate airport company offers 50 secondary aircrafts from type Boeing 777 with a option on 20 more aircrafts.
Furthermore, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner in Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a amazing message that a company gets a task over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a great business when the company of the airport producer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airports is totally at a record room of 18 million dollars.
In the same way, the Boeing employer is the Middle East, a growing goldmine for future airports.
In a prognose published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airports from the Middle East are required in the next 20 years 2.520 airports for $450 million.
Boeing announced his greatest job in the weekend, all times for commercial aircraft, measured in the value of the statement: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The chairman's job came from the airport Emirates from Dubai.
Furthermore, Boeing was in 2011 on the Dubai Airport View, a option on the buying of 20 other aircrafts that allows the total list price to 26 million dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air was established by Boeing Oman Air sixs Boeing 787-8, the named Dreamliner, which has greatly improved the benzin consumption and the comfort of the passioners.
The list price for six this airport is at more than 1 billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a bunch of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special clients is very high."
Many air companys of the Middle East are in possession of oil production countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but mostly it is a increase of the oil prices that usually destroys the aircraft company because this is one of their largest cost points, not so bad because the land is a higher oil price.
This is important because they are able to steal less than other aircraft companies to load or move airlines when the oil prices increased, Dihora said.
"You have a natural insurance," he said.
The establishment of Emirates strengthens Boeings leading position on the market for large space aircrafts and helps the airbus competitors SAS in shock, which enhances A350.
Boeings Vig on the air View comes four months after Airbus has announced, you would move the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competited with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was moved to win more confidence after the customers had requested a higher use and resource load.
The Boeing Acts increased $1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the President of Mexico seems to lose choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon said that the drug officer Gegner Fausto Vallejo was supported by the PRI in the road for government posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have perished their responsibility to the Governor's Office of Muchoacan during the civilian elections, and she was concerned on Monday, the drug officer would have influenced the reach of one of her owners.
Following the previous results, Fausto Vallejo won from the Institutional Party of Revolution, the PRI, the travel for the Governing Boards in the West State.
"The income of the organizated crime during the whole election process and especially on the strict day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Louisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They have suffered our candidates, our co-operators in the reviews... You have placed choice cabins to build travel blocks... and people have encouraged to vote [in the PRI]."
The PRI regulated seventy years in Mexico until they lost the presidentship in 2000.
But they turn back and win in Michoacan is a important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the President election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just been cut down to Claderon who had been carried out in the questions before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido National Action PAN of their brothers, refused to recognize Vallejo as a victor.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is currently manager, came to place three, a severe downgrade for the packed and happy left leader for the President's election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the previous results.
Vallejo, ancient citizen manager of the main city of Morelia, denied connections to drugs and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been maintained a long time of drug cards specialized on Marihuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon, and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug handlers in December 2006.
The violence still ends.
A PAN citizen manager was killed a week before the election during a choice establishment for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates were exhausted from fear of the local choices.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, unlike how the choices in Michoacan appear in contrast.
The man who would likely represent the PRI for the Chairman of the Chairman is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, and said, "I think this train will let us be courageous in the next year."
ADB driving Asia to help in the rescue of the Eurozone
The Development Bank of Asia (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls to India and China to support the saving of the eurozone in its severe crimes to prevent a long-term driving train that will increase the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of ADB with a seat in Manila, said that the two of the most rapidly growing economic institutions of the world must be "all in your power" to ensure the maintenance of the monetary block or by the International Monetary Fund or directly contradictional agreements.
He warned before the BRIC countries (Brasil, Russia, India, China), who looked at the difficulties in Europe and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources helped to prevent a long-term cooperation of the global economy through Asia.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"So is every help that Europe can help from this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the border of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain grade, but it's not immune."
"When China and India can help, then with all the media."
The European Monetary Union has been raised in a serious crime in the past months.
In the past days, Italian cyncosts have been in danger and the Prime Ministers have been returned from Italy and from Greece.
The higher serious crime in Europe is the worst that the global economy could smooth in the recession and leads to calls that the leadership countries should be joined to support the Eurozone.
Mr. Nang said that every support of Asia was channeled by the IWF, but he said that contrast agreements - such as the buying of the EU regulatory funds, the European Financial Stabilisty Facility (EFSF) – the European partners in Asia is a greater treatment force.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Ministry, said that "India will do everything that is in its power," to help the eurozone, because the own economy is now under the exports and the extraction of the outland capital flows.
"Nobody wants that the eurozone continues to stay instable and turbulent," he said.
"We stand before great requirements and we need to get a high growth level."
"It's not a option, it's a task, because we find work for millions of young men and women."
Others argued that developing economies such as India have no agreement to help the rich Europeans if they stand before great economic requirements.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of the United States Brown University, said that it would be very difficult to sell the 1.2 million people in India, which are more than 800 million of $2 or less on the day.
"Therefore they will find out that the Greeks go with 50 in rounds and get away from the street, and then there's a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, the Governor of the World Economic Forum, as well as why Indian reserves should be used to maintain the number of and good payments in the public service to lead to bad workshops, the losses of importing equipment as well as the ice field.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the Eurozone would have "significant Lord effects" in all Asia.
The prognoses of ADB with an economic growth of 7,5 per cent in Asia for the 2011/receives "the risk of disagreement" due to the dangers of Europe.
He said, "Christian plans" must be created in the case of a foreign train and a significant capital exchange of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible interactions in defence
The Ministry of Defence Leon Panetta urged the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budgets would notice national security, so he solved a financial reaction from the Halls of Pentagon until the war fields in Afghanistan and the civic flows.
The pentagon has already considered currences of 450 billion dollars during the next decade, but now it is afraid that more currencies will be needed for 600 billion dollars or more if the congress cannot achieve a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The effects of these curtains would be married for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republic Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that an advice of the Congress in the achievement of a budget agreement that will lead to such a proposal would lead to 23% of general courses and to stop several new projects.
"Self a high cutting, conducted in such unconsidered kinds and ways, most of our ships and building projects would be unrealable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other moderation efforts seriously threatened to the Senators.
"We would also be obliged to separate us from a large majority of our citizens, and because the reduction would be so quickly implemented, we should be able to make civilists to get the goal to be achieved with a certain limitable possibility."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who have obtained our soldiers and are seriously harmful."
The challenges were finally meeting the battle forces," said Panetta.
"When the war-time contingents are not directly affected by the statement, the severe invasion in the main budget would affect the warning efforts in part," Mr Panetta warned.
"Personal settings were cut down to the procedures in the settings and the setting overview supporting the war."
"The staffs of the person would be cut off what will lead to later payments to war-times and would be cut off legal as political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and requested further details on the potential impact of the automatic curtains on the Defence Minister.
"The consequences of the statement of the Ministry of Defence would be a quick disagreement of the United States as the leader of the world's military power."
"We are aware of this dramatic action," the senators said in a common statement on Monday afternoon, when they publish Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live, and it's certainly nothing that we should take up."
"The proposal is not to be suspended by the national security interests of the United States and their entities."
Should Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the Senators increase the pressure on a compromise in the Budget or strengthen the requirements to take the pentagon of curves, continue to wait.
Panetta has exclaimed the possible curses, although he could collect experiences with the Budget in the Congress and white house before he came to the Pentagon's pit, and he knows that he is a serious decision.
At a press conference in the past week, the Ministry of Defence made a dark picture that could be - a military with shield, but without kernel.
"It's a ship without matrix."
"It's a brigade without munition."
"It's a airwater guard without enough loaded pilots."
"It's a roller, a army of the caserns, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers who are in the field to fulfil the mission," said Panetta in his opening language in Pentagon.
"It's a battle force that does not miss it in moral and alarming and which is not able to take it with potential affairs."
"It's going to be a really crazy."
In an annex to his letters at McCain and Graham, Panetta brought new details as reductions "significant operational risks: procedures in crisis times, conflicts and catastrophes, serious limitations of our worldwide use and ingravacy, which leads to an inacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could fall to the victim, including those who have already been held and already exist in the previous planning phase.
This list includes also the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb flyer, the next generation of ballist U-boat, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground car rental, needs the army and marine to replace the hume.
If you have stopped further development and tests of the F35 test, it would be achieved in the next 10 years to 80 million dollars, but the guaranteers say that it is a important step to destruction, so that possible risks may be punished through China and other guarantees.
How a liar can be able to be lying
A looking on the current rows shows how amazing and wide plots and lie are in the daytime life.
The Presidentkandidat of the Republican, Herman Cain, is occupied to be committed to the accusations of sexual immorality since many women, and both sides are respected against the lies.
The leadership of Penn State will be accused of my mind because you have rejected the reports after which a pensioned football boys have missed sexually.
In the past week, there was an open microphone when the French president Nikolas Sarkozy had spoken to the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a liar.
Lies destroyed carriers and hurt countries.
The New Yorker Congress and the Internet Exhibitionat Anthony Weidner was to be narrown when he made disobediences that were very quickly rejected by a single test.
The previous presidential candidate John Edwards will be accused of the expenditure in the campaign financing, which is in relation to the disaster of a foreign affair.
And then, of course, no one who has lived, the medical circus, the President Bill Clinton, has solved when he lie in his second office time in Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The story of smoking in school and at college tests are widely widely expanded.
There were cases in which the teachers gave their students the test responses to make them good in their delivery checks.
Mentors who should teach the same part, send a message that lie and dreams are okay.
How much do we live?
As studies, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies are worthless.
Another study shows that strangers lie against three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
The lie to recognize or "detecting lie" is an important learning for each person, and this is personally as well as for professional reasons.
Since a society plays such as sharades, for example, to call "Have you!", the department of a series of science areas based on scientist data collected in the past six-year-year-old universities, which have been conducted by large research projects, especially in the areas of psychology and physiology.
A result of the investigation is that most of the old mythes have been deceived about the lie.
The lying looks one in the eyes.
They're stopping, smoking, smoking, smoking, and not always crying.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these lies are hard to discover and deteriorate.
A regular lying tanner can lead to the truth by learning something about the structure of the achievement, the famous face expressions, the question and the timing.
I have done several years to investigate the scientific results of the continuous and growing area of the department, and it is clear that the department of an advancement is a modern capacity that is easy to learn and help us in our complex world, especially if the establishment or question of persons or negotiations or administrative responsibilities.
The good lies are very good in it to appreciate others to deal with their interests and to dominate their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they will be taken from others.
Thanks to the research, we know that the extroverted people often lie more than introverted people that men often lie lying than women who lie more "in others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people often lying their partners less than unmarried people (but the lying they say, most of them are "faith lying".
We also know that when a person was detained as a criminal, others feel less guilty to have this person.
How do you know if someone lie?
First, seeing the normal behavior of this person.
It's called "Baselining", the output position.
It provides a reference point to later evaluation of changes.
Watch the maintenance, the laughing, the sound quality of their test.
You should know better if someone usually tricks with the feet, so that they don't accuse him to wrong if he tricks with the feet during a meeting.
Then take care of the aspects of a random and non-verbal treatment.
Look at these occurrences as alarm blogs, which shrink, not as a evidence of a deterioration.
People who smile, may be surprised when they try to remember their story. Perhaps they show their feet in the direction of the door, or they lie out, change their position in significant ways, or show a "leading after the setting," this depth, depth, amazing exchange and change in the maintenance, when all serious questions are fulfilled.
The questionnaire often is fatal to sign that a setting conversation is preliminary only to maintain a view after this disaster.
Take care of the language of your test.
The extractor of Scott Peterson is happy when he used the past form when he said that his murdered wife is still alive and a national search is solved after her.
Smoking people can also use a distance language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a critical question in the whole.
The most frequency signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualifishing languages" when they answer a critical question: "Now... to tell you the truth... as long as I know... after best knowledge and conscience."
The answer will be more serious than the fact that the alarm flows often scream.
There is no nuts to discharge lying, but you can learn the ability to be able to discharge.
Thanks to these abilitys, everyone can be a stranger for the sacrifice of employees, even in private and in the employment.
Restritting plan of an oil pipeline is transformed after dangerously by an U.S. authorised authorisation
A few days after the Obama Government has been struggled to allow the authorisation of a planned oil pipeline of Canada into the golf of Mexico, where you have suffered the businesses and at the same time environmental protectors, the pipeline is trying to plan the project again to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday's evening that the planned pipelines will be removed from the ecological reception area of Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision on a press conference in Nebraska's parliamentary building.
Alex Umbax of TransCanada said that the company continues to be consisting that the pipeline is finally approved, even with another story.
This came after an announcement of the Foreign Ministry in the past week, after which you decided on a contractual assessment for the project until the new possible storage was checked by the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Acquifer, a large subwater service.
"This is, however, a step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental check that has approved the external ministry may make a decision to 2013 after the elections in the next year, even if the officers deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained the past week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and said to support him.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to Canada with the golf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from the Province Alberta to the Raffineries in Texas.
In this way, the Pipeline had to follow six States.
The environmental protectioners hate them, but the work markets love, because they assume that the pipeline makes 20,000 workplaces.
However, the lawyers Nebraskas, who are against the plan, decline the laws to avoid the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala Acquifer, a main source of drink waters and waters.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the external ministry has discovered that the project had only a little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy considers that the main controller of the Ministry has requested a separate conclusion of the control procedure that focused on two questions.
It is whether a lobbyist who was established by TransCanada Paul Elliott, the 2008 Counciler of Hillary Clinton, was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that has been invited to carry out the original study was an inadequate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is attracted because she's obviously a little kid of fear to break
A New Yorker family said that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan buildings had received a threat incident that her little daughter had so threatened that she had delivered her to fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer was 18 months old Genevieve Monk so feared that they were sorry for "Personal changes, sleep disorders" and "extreme fear for strangers", said their family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a child garden, and Genevieve wanted to break up to a family refuge.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went on the arm in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she has stopped near the door and she was arrested for a moment.
"Anyone looked behind me, and said, "Will you know what your daughter does right?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle reminded the younger woman wearing.
"She said in a aggressive sound, 'You should not leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told you, "I don't care what you say or think."
She was smoking and started shooting - she used the F-word and the A-word and was very lying...
She had a flash water in his hand and began to cut water out of the flash on me.
She said Genevieve would become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threatened the mother, who still carried Geneva on the arm, and had to stop her meeting and go to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to be delivered, she said.
Afterward, LaBelle's family wrotely requested an excuse, but there was no answer.
The LaBelles lawman and representative did not respond to the calls in which a opinion was requested.
The challenge is not closer to a certain disagreement, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he was not honoured in account and the family plan, the money that she gets, will send the child's care.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely inacceptable, especially when a child garden is placed against the day that leads a 18 months old baby on the arm."
Climate responsibilities are more than the economy
In the first year, in Mario López Valdez in the Government, the unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while the external investments returned and the economy raised up.
It is the first year in Mario López Valdez, which is named as the initiative of the wallet, and great hopes relating to the economic growth, are in the Government. However, according to the climate responsibilities, it cannot be the story of growth, but the major economic indicators have been lost.
The low temperatures in February have not only caused the losses in millions of landscapes, but have increased the growth of the State Economic in frontiers, and in the first fourth year, a general reduction of the economic agency of 3,6 per cent This is mainly on the history of agricultural development of 31,16 per cent, which has turned into further economic sectors.
According to one report made by the Mexican Council para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (including the Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) on the effects of the Frost, 582 000 hectares in agricultural use of countries have been disappeared from 78,03 per cent and the rest 21.07 per cent was partly destroyed.
The Instituto National of Statistics and Geography observed in the first fourth year a fast growth of unemployment, since since January to March 55 053 Sinaloas had no employment that 4,53 per cent of the population of consumption. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased 5,28 per cent from July to September 6,19 percent, since since 74 000 unemployment had been followed by Sinaloa. This was not employed by the following.
Lower Liquidity
The worklessness in Sinaloa is returned to several factors in the year. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Decan of the Faculty for Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autonoma (AUAS), comments that the political policy of public institutions will directly explain the growing worklessness.
"What we now observe is a growth of the unemployment that has to do with several factors, otherwise with liquidity losses on the market in accordance with the legislation that has been prohibited to fight the moneywater in the Conference, because it is not easy to let them work for themselves to invest them or to use something else."
Migration stopped
López Cervantes claims that the growing worklessness also contains a demographic factor.
"The number of people who are looking for work in the country, especially in the United States, has gone back, and this is one of them to return to the income problems, and otherwise because there is difficult to find a job.
Black work
The analysis of the work market in Sinaloa is more difficult if you consider the higher part of the black work, which includes in accordance with INEGI 60,38 per cent of the employees in the country who are working without paying in the box of social security.
The smallest workshops in the entire Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexico del Security Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariat del Trabajoy and Social Prevision (Regulation Authority for Working and Social Resources in Mexico).
The average month of the workers in Sinaloa was achieved until September 5252 Pesos, which is very less than the whole country average that is at 7375 Pesos.
ADI Regression
Besides the rebuilding of the Economic Agency and the growing worklessness, in 2011, the strongest return of the external direct investment (ADI) of the last ten years. According to Secretaria de Economia (State Economiy Authority), the ADI from January to June 630 597, which has been raised by 87,74 per cent in comparison with the 543,312 dollars in the same period.
The Secretariat de Desarrollo Economico del Governo (Region Authority for Economic Development) describes a total exhibition of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which is in the territory sector for all businesses.
The Courts
In view of the economic crisis, the country Government in July in the National Congress requested a credit of 3 000 000 000 000 Pesos, which should be invested to reactivate the economic in infrastructure projects in 18 communities. The country conference accepted amount in height of 200 600 000 Pesos, but until November could not be established positive effects on any of the economic routes in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the company, Mario López's first government year was obviously able to govern Valdés.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Camara National de la Industria de la Transformation (State room of the processing industry in Mexico) said that in 2011 there were no intentions to harmonize the views of various sectors, including the country government.
"The Economic Agency in Sinaloa was really very necessary in this year, and it must be hard to work hard to retreat the loss of the earth in this year and 2012 we need to doublely try. The efforts of all and, in particular, the progresss of the government teams already attached to each other are not sufficiently satisfied."
Langage Economic Development
Loredo López expressed that events, as the flow begins at the year, the economic development of the country has increased and suffered.
"The smaller economic flow is the result of several events, e.g. of the Frost. One of the most important effects is a sustainable economy that is not sufficiently in movement to prevent an economic dynamic that could create a acceptable flow of processes, products and services, so we will be concluded the year below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Application
The Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairperson of the Confederation Patronal de la Republic of Mexico (Mexican Republic), explained in Sinaloa, that the State should leave dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it was worked, and we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-determine the economic call and line of the country, because it is important to enable all material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stated how important it was to develop a future perspective that leads the efforts of the Government in better areas.
"In general, I would say that the Government has received good results in various areas, and the economic development has come before, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He noted that the current State Government has progressed in the Government.
"There are areas in respect of which you can say that the government has been treated more, and what I can say is that it has been worked and that the Government is aware that there is a lot of work before her," he said.
Capture for 8 kg Marihuana
Five years of prison and 100 days were judged by a resident of Navolato for the possession of eight Kilo Marihuana.
The State Government of the Republic has known that the drugklein officer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against the public health - here a certain possession of Marihuana to trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican soldiers at the monitoring of the streets of Cypriano Valdez against the growth No. 80 in the apartment of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug kidney was driving in a white car where he found a black tit in a box in the car and on the ship with a small rock sack, where the soldier found eight kilos and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the proposed product was delivered to the judge of the District, and the resistance continues to be in the full-scale.
Courts for Building Works
The social buildings provided in the Habitat programmes, Rescate de Espacios Publicos and 3x1 are not completed because of missing means or only with a great delay, Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The officer of the citizens for social development declared that, although the building programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger because the State Government has not paid its existing funds for the three programmes of 11 million Peso.
He said that the total census in these three programmes were approximately 50 million Peso, from which 25 percent fell to the State, and that only the Federation and the communities would have contributed to the construction works, so that it would have been expected to reach the end of the building.
"12 million have to be able to do them, and although the year has already gone, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had already had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already started with the building works, and they have already gone long, but we need the money."
He declared that under the Government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla of the State, his obligations were not agreed, therefore the community should take a credit at the beginning of its government period of 7 million.
"This has already been done in the last legislation period, because the State has not been available on sufficient economic means, and the programmes have continued and we needed to establish the funds that the State had not made to participate in these programmes."
Even if the State authorities are obligated to pay this fund, he commented that the Ministry for Administration and Financial Affairs was requested to pay the administrative works and to pay the outcome part as fast as possible.
"Fass 12 millions of them have to be able to do, and although the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to the digital TV in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogs on digital signals is in the last years of the world to the most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Court of Mexico (SCJN), as well as the conformity claims made by the Senat and the Deputy House against the President Law, and the strength that the transposition of analogues to digital signals of 2021 to 2015 should be submitted, on the basis of the missing eight voices required for law.
A minimum of four Ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that the President Felipe Calderon had not passed his competences when he had issued the law's decree with the detailed detail on the change on the earthly digital view.
This Decision has been rejected by the reception of the Senate in life because he has not received the required majority of eight votes to decide on the ability of the consciousness or non-comprehensiveness, and the law remains in force.
In the draft for the project for the plan made by Ministry Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to explain the law-decreasing guidelines, as for which the radio and the telecommunications were complied with the Federal de Telecommunications (Cofetel) (First Commission for Telecommunication in Mexico), the law decree would be responsible for the herearch principles and the legislative proposals.
The benefits of the project were only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero themselves.
With this argument, the Senat and the Deputy Chamber of Conference against the Law Secretary, the Ministry of Sanchez Cordero had no longer addressed the law's secretary and established all activities for the establishment of digital transfers.
The Ministry Council also decreased the packaging of the Secretary-General, without entering into the debate on the project, for which the Ministry of Sanchez Cordero was also complied.
In his contribution, the President of the Ministry has not agreed with the arguments of the project, and in the meaning that the Government should not regulate the measures to adopt public management.
"I don't believe that if you would do this, the independentness of the regulation office would be involved." She also remembered that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunication sector, the central government is complied with the State's issues.
The replacement of analog signals through digital is one of the most important changes found in the last years of the world, and it affects a better use of the radio-electric spektrum, a higher quality of signals and more channels.
The exchange of transformation said that it would be a replacement of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest, which has not only technical faces, "the fact that it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stated: "Reserve the trade of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the State, they contained a group of characteristics which enable the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She said that many countries had already carried out digital reforms in the world, although the Government had above high-specialised institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the Government entered into the competences of the Congress, since the laws adopted by the legislation would be undertaken."
The possibility of calculating the voting steel in Micoacan is to be considered in consideration.
According to the information of PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the selection of the Governor is about 27 per cent, where 879 votes were not yet expressed.
The possibility of a single calculation of the vote is in this year a reality in the choices in Michoacan, since the data issued by the Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) is the differences between the first and second place in the Governing elections bottom 27 per cent, which is not yet calculated by 879 votes of total 6074.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), Mary de Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that the election has decided a number of rules to harmonize the local rules with the reforms of the United States in the Wahlan business.
It is reminded that Michoacan does not apply his political conscience or his elections, nor his law on the election legality to the reforms of the Congress, so that these were not in force in this election border. The Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel, intercepted its publication in the State Senator in the terms proposed by the argument, or the end of the day.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexican (SCJN) decided on the local legislation plan and evaluated the vote of the State committee to the repair reforms as "invalid and jurisdiction" because this does not have the right to "determine or enter a veto."
Mary de Los Angeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of the individual statement of the votes that, through the adopting Directives by the Council General del IEM, the possibility of the local election authority may be shared or completely calculated.
So, in the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages may not be complied with the results in the protocol; the Protocol on the Calculation and Calculation does not be acting attentively before or is not in the property of the Chairman of the Waly Committee or there are manifest errors or changes in the protocols.
Furthermore, the total number of the completely completed choices may result when there is a difference between the mutual winner and the second place, which is equal or less than a percentage, provided for at the beginning of the meeting, is an explicit request of the Partie or Coalition President, the second of the candidates concerned.
The voting calculation can also result in its whole case, after the conclusion of the ordinary calculation, the difference between the needy winner and the candidate is equal or less than a percentage, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party who has become the second candidate. In this case, the choice packages that have been issued in a party statement would be excluded.
It is considered that the choices in Morelia are in the same situation where the PREP difference between the first and the second place is bottom 0,16%, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 election protocols are not yet calculated.

On the Mediterranean education of the new Italian Government
The designed Ministry, Mario Monti, comes tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that the Crisis, which has led Italian to the border of the economic assembly, should offer the stresss.
The designed Ministry, Mario Monti, comes tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that the Crisis, which has led Italian to the border of the economic assembly, should offer the stresss.
A communication from the Chairman's past announced that Monti, which was called on Sunday, would take a meeting with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to ensure the government education.
It will be concluded that he will present a majority of technology combined cabinet, although it is not clear when the new President will take his office.
Monti said that he would present the President the results of the discussion with the political parties for government education.
"I want my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to be completed with these difficult times," said the ancient Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government education, but his comments show that the restrictions are overridden.
"The branch is now well locked," he added.
Monti has made it in less than three days to make a government, that is a lot of less time than normal, while Italia fights against a political and financial crisis which has carried out the costs for crimes in an increasing height.
The new Government made by the ancient EU Commissary Monti must decide a serious scanner package requested by the European Politicals to renew the trust in Italy.
The pressure for the egg that was loaded on Monti was still strengthened by the low market level, according to the Italian state rules for 10 years, with 7 per cent rates, and that is the position to visit the Greece and Ireland to visit the European salvation screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian industrybands Confindustria, shared the price after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government through all powers."
We believe that this Government is the last chance of Italian out of this notification.
The successs of Montis were greatly increased by supporting the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, which had to return on the Sabbath after the crisis.
"We believe that the intentions of Professor Monti are determined to get good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest part of Italy, is essential, since many of their members have spoken against a majority of technologies, the Monti is now formed.
Aid of the Parliament
The new Government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the most likely unlimited staff measures.
Resistance against its efforts or the reforms can again influence a renewable attack of financial markets.
The Italian bond of foreign banks lies with its indication that a verse Montis is a catastrophe, even the pressure.
Monti started in the month with its debates with political party, business and business partners, as well as with young and women's organizations.
The meeting border should be completed.
Monti was named this Sunday of Napolitano, who made a extremely quick government change in Gang as a response to the crisis.
After short-term advantages against the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would return, the unsecurity of the success of the new President has reached the costs for the Italian State Leadership.
It would be too much for the current EU resolution.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, although the proposals that the policy would only give him time to implement reforms instead of introducing the elections.
Monti expressed that he would like to take politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties are in view that this only should be technical, a view to their thoughts regarding the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the contradict miscreases and unity between the parties complies the relationship of persons from the political life.

The Quinted visited Costa Rica in his tournee to feed his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that can be able to play"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is ready to give the next Sunday in the National City one of its best concerts.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band ensures that they have a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
This ensure that the Bassist and colleagues of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva last week from Brazil, gave a exclusive interview.
The band is in the South America's part of their tour to feed their twenty-year-old existence and on the Sunday, on the 20th, they take their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they went up from 19:30 in the National City with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read a exhibition from the conversation that is fully found in the online output of La Nation.
For your costarian fans a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also allows us to play.
It's just the second time we play in South and Central America, and it was great until now.
I was just once in Costa Rica, and it's such a beautiful country that we're supposed to stay there for a few days.
It's easy to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely achieved. They live the days before the concert.
What are you talking about your best fans?
Thanks for staying all these years on our side.
We needed almost 21 years until we arrived to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it's sorry to have used so long until we came here.
Some people are even thinking that your concert will be the greatest show of the year.
Doesn't this make a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have set in the last 21 years found in the last two weeks.
We have played a few rieseshows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that they have made us fixed for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're lucky to play there.
We love this country, we like to be surrounded and beat from the Dschungel, for which Costa Rica is the best countries of the world.
How have you learned Costa Rica and his bottles to survey?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarando where the weights are just unpredictable.
My friends are always going to survey to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico are the wonderful areas to survey. In this way, we have learned about people who love the surface.
With a look at the tournee, you ordered her rieseshows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we've never played there, we don't have limited.
We'll try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play some songs from each album and offer our fans a good and virtual repertoire.
You're never repeating your repertoire.
Why?
I think it's part of that because we have nine platts and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we're playing is not easy.
If we take two or three songs we haven't played longer, in the repertoire, we can get our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons of the story why these songs have enjoyed us.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the public.
With this tourne you feed your twenty-year-year story.
If you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First, I believe that no one of us has imagined to play a great rockband, and that's also more than 20 years ago, it's like a dream.
We also put it on this blessing and find it great, even now we can still make music together.
We like and we are encouraged to bring music.
We have happy to go to the places of the world that we always wanted to visit.
The things couldn't be better.
What was it meaning to you to participate in the born time of the reason?
It was always a honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We're welcome with the people of sound gardens, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprised and richly irregular when a move from a group of friends comes.
Go and go back a band out of a city, but it is already in common when five or ten groups are coming out of the same city.
We are honourable and feel happy to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canadian with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on their tour. We're happy to be still joyful to all of them, and it's honorable to be part of this reaching Seattle sounds.
It is also very incompatible that a band like yours with the same musicians have been so long together.
Yes, four of us are playing together since 21 years and Matt (Cameron) increased to us 13 years ago. This is only much more time than overcoming many bands.
First, I think we all appreciate happy, still be in life, and we also take care of each other.
We are all a friend, because we have opened musical ways to give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music, it couldn't be better to us.
Your relationship with the glory was not always easy. On the other hand, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a similar weight?
As we grow, it makes us easier to find a similar growth.
We are sure not too much to be on tournee, because it's too easy to lose this game with rich human masses that love your music.
While you think people have come because of the music, you remember that you have to watch the music and what they have called in life, without to be a funny Rockster, that has never been interested in us.
What reminders do you have at your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years, which never had issued a plate until Andy died (Andrew Woods).
We were deceived to have so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I see a song or photos, I think what was an incredible man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, to laugh together, and to talk about music and football and many other subjects.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The Inlands band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it that you know their works, especially Eddie Veder, and that's why you have searched the band for opening?
Yes, the production sent to us videos from several groups, and this band enjoyed us best, so we are nervous to see what Las Robertas can live.
Why can you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play alive?
This is a question for Eddie Veder, I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
From whom have you been influenced as Basisist?
From so many+
To the first ones I'm in, belongs to Geezer Butler, John Deswistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukoski...
It's so much that I could talk about the Bassists who like me all the afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam get to keep the reasons of life, although it doesn't work for a moderation?
I think we don't all feel very connected to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I'll fall in the bands I've mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Garden, Nirvana and all others who have arrived at the same time. If they are still important today, I'll find the biggest, because it's worth to hear this music, and Bands like Mudhoney do now better music than before.
In the beginning, her music was dark, now she is positive.
Why?
It's interesting, because I think there's some songs on the new album that could make something easier, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which will be inspired as very dark songs, although they have something positive to themselves.
They came to me the dreams when I heard like Ed she played, and it's very dark songs.
I think if you're older and something traumatic in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - the influence of your artistic birds and your music and these two songs will make it clear for me.
But I am also thinking that you can be a happy man and however you can do dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came again to hospital
The former President Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital on Sunday to investigate the loss of the muscle of his feet, reported his household.
The 72 years old Fujimori, the 25-year-year-old age of perception of human rights during his government time (1990-2000), has been absent of several diseases, including language cycle, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, the Congress member and his personal doctor, said to the TV that Fujimori would investigate the reason for his pain and the loss of muscle in the underbody members of the Peruan hospital Instituto National of Neoplásicas.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion could be related to Fujimori for humanitari reasons, but he did not want to do this because he remained innocent.
He was operated four times in tongue curbs and he lost 18 kilo weights. In this way there are more diseases like a serious erosive gastritis, a sister in the woods satellite, neighborhood stone, blood pressure and blowing problems in the stones, the doctor numbered.
Fujimori was located since September 2007 in the Haftanstalt National Director of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was condemned at 25 years of prison for murdering 25 people through the death chair of the Peruan Army, which was secretly executed during his government time.
Mujica goes to Mexico to strengthen political relations
A official approach, introduced by the Uuguay President José Mujica, and there are from several ministers and employers, started their visit from Mexico on Sunday to address the trade between both countries and political subjects of the region.
Mujica is on the next week with his Mexican office colleagues Felipe Calderon. This will be according to the data of the Uuguay President of the high point of his exposed plan with politics, business leaders and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The consultation of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "with beneficial for information on all political areas between the two countries," the President of the South Americas on his website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks the support of Calderon in respect of the interference with France, when the French governor Nicolas Sarkozy was set on the G20 cities in the French city of Cannes, the South American country was set on a list of steadfast paradies.
In his discussion, Sarkozi was made that those countries who still have been achieved to exclude the international community, and this statement was rejected by Uruguay, and a request for his newspapers in the European country.
Mexican has since November the Chairman of the G20, a group of the most powerful weight and industrial countries of the world. Since January this year, a agreement is established on the expenditure of steadfast information to promote the double agreement with the South American country.
The Government of Uruguays has tried to conclude the concretion of Agreements on the exchange of steadfast information in order to be exhausted from the "great list" of the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD), which is therefore not all international standards for cooperation in assessments.
On a employment level there is a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing guest rate between both countries.
The smooth installer has the third size with "Super Mario 3D country"
Super Mario has fighted for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clues of the bad bowser, but never in three sizes: in "Super Mario 3D country" he fights against the love of the girl in Stereo technology.
The game that comes on the load technology of all the world has come from the beginning to the properties of the tragable Console Nintende 3DS, which can be played threedimensionally without a special brill.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscope works without light", confirmed Omar Alvarez, the responsibility for the Nintendo specificized prices in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained, "Super Mario 3D country" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which was developed from the beginning for this console" because until now there were success articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments already existing titles.
The Nintendo speaker understood that, although it's threedimensional, "Super Mario 3D country" is a "increasing" video game that allows a fast, flexible game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D country" two games in an enthial: The first part is "leather" to start the less shocked users.
Then the experts can turn a "due round" on the different games that will always be difficult.
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between a "agressive D" or a "agressive D" which only affects the depth of the action. To overwinning the hinders, without sacrifices of the "optical effects" should be played threedimensionally.
This exit of Super Mario in the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a tragic console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo moves the fans of Saga and repeats the success receipt of the last expenditure: The fast-baring installer must overcome the risks of the spicted platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player takes news in movements, environment, clothing and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom is built for the delivery of Portillos in the United States
The Chairman of Guatemala, Alvaro Colom, announced this day that he would offer the ex-governmental rulers Alfonso Portillo to answer this in the United States for the defense of $70 million.
So the United States' request for the delivery of Portillo will end the process to be sent before the Court.
In a press-conference, the Colomn confirmed that its decision based on the independentness of the jurisdiction and Government that a decision-making court has already approved the delivery.
He noted that during his government he did not communicate in court decisions and put all the expenditure requests of whom he had been identified.
Further than Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquin is delivered by murder and severe body pollution, Edgar Strata Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trade.
The past Coloms is a Government Act that will succeed when all judicial and judicial institutions are exceeded by the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Court of Justice and the Court of Justice Guatemalas, Portillo must be issued if its law is clarified in Guatemalale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was free for the explanation of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his government time, and this negotiation was forward, but the Ministry put an obligation to repeat the case to the new.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people from social exclusion
The organization has been called to promote the marginalization of young people without professional training in life.
The first 25 years of life of the Social Help Organization Trinijove have resulted in important results: In this fourth century, 6000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way from their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than hundred workplaces created for this social group.
At the day of the year, it was last at an event in the old work buildings of Fafa i Coats, where more than 300 persons participated.
Trinijove was called in 1986 in the city quarter Trinidad Vella with the goal of life to help young people with small education status, without work, with drug problems that were able to help by the risk of marginality.
In Sant Andreu, several responsibilities of institutions and institutions, which have cooperated with the Treaty in these 25 years.
The participation of the political representatives of various directions to choice-found times was the unparty of the work made by Trinijove.
Furthermore, the President of the Generality (Parlament of Autonome Region Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his advanced Jerdi Pujol participated in the feast of the former socialistic Ministry Ernest Maragall and the former citizen manager and currently Green City Council Ricard Goma.
The great salary of Fabra i Coats also visited the current catalogue minister for social and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas indicated that Trinijove was called in very difficult times in life and that today's time is not less complicated, but he added that the work that was launched until now is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generality, Trinijove is a form of fighting with difficult circumstances and humans in difficult hope.
"The economic crisis is for the Treaty and the work that he provides is nothing new," he explained.
The invested house in the ries party was dreamed
The households had 11 of 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve households left the building last afternoon without resistance.
Everything shows that the rooms of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found a end on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people left yesterday freely the building that they had held legally and organized a large fishing that had taken the neighborhood to devote, and the room had been held on legal order without political entry.
After the room, the door close was replaced to prevent a similar situation.
"Ab now the future will be controlled," confirmed the householder.
The households who had placed 11 of the 13 rooms of the building - the rest of the building - took the whole electrical facility and part of the water care. They also attached the walls and left all kinds of muscles, especially dozens with alcohol dress.
In the three bottoms there were a large party that continued to two days, and the mine were running to devote.
Besides the building, there is a disposal, Balmes 51, which also caused the worries of it.
Her inhabitants, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Press that their business would be returned from the beginning of the household at 80%.
The owner of the diskothy also concluded that the household officers made their unlawful competition because they sold the drinks to three euros while they costed 10 euros in the diskothek.
Furthermore, the property of the free-time location was shown by neighbors because of respiration, while their dream was not exhausted by the visitors of the disk, but from the households, and especially from the guests of the feasts that were organized there, and they were still longer after the explanations of the worried neighbors in the past weeks.
The responsibility of the diskothy explained that the detention was so great that it was agreed to the owner of the building for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (City Police) also confirmed that they have received more excuses from the neighbors in the past weeks.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the city Council of Barcelonas, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested to explore the building in the last week and to reach the problems of the citizen cohesion and the income of the citizenship.
He explained that before the Sunday was only one age of the building, but that the households in the last months were prevented and almost all the rooms were prevented.
In this sense, he added: "It is necessary to put out the unfaithfulness and to achieve the associational actions in the building."
Yesterday a new building in the city quarter Nou Barris was dreamed from the Catholic Police.
At 15.30, the police closed the street of Montral No 35 after she had received a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or Berg?
The architectures have been understood by the streets on the honour with the exhibition.
The citizen statement on 16 gates opens the debate on the meaning of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.
Middle of the 1980s, at the high point of the departed Corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its smoking letter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a rich park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the CMB in 1987, the park was reached to the top border of Barcelona, because the main city of the Catalonians is the smallest that spread not in the north-sud direction, but to the top (Girge) and bottom (Sea).
The vocation of Collserolas as natural park plays with this idea.
As a picture, it was now not more of the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildshweets in the role of Yogiber.
It was so far as the city in September was a rise writer, existing from 16 competitions, for more access offices to Collserola.
There is no doubt a gate to the concept of a park.
Or it's like, or somebody's proposed to put the doors on the country.
The question is from itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The exhibition is not only from the organizational view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the conversation theme in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recursive theme that can take back to the two members of this old box that are in the ship.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the strange agreements between the three architects of Barcelona, and some university professionals who have moved to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: The exhibition is accepted.
For Roldán "that is necessary" after the attack on the town about the "front on the mountain" while the talkers of Ildefons Cerda, which were not issued over the green eggs.
"Man should go out of the principle that Barcelona's greatest park in the street.
On the other hand, because he's good access.
Collserola is complexer, judges the architecture for which the "Tore of Colzerola" is a "lexical case" title: you can't "improving as access to a park, but as a limited limit of areas to which it should be treated."
Modl, such as Roldán and Bayona with cities built experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual exemption" that is "the only dangers".
Consequently, the "insurance that brings the establishment of a public space today" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swanengelig" in the forum.
The first fear is the own limit to what can be built.
"Whatever a limited means to set up the next step," says he override.
"Man needs to think about new town planning tools, because the current [related on the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Model, who is low to the question, is simply simply the side of Collserola, which goes in the Vallesana direction, "can be understood as a park that doesn't have Barcelona's direction," and however, from clean topographic reasons.
Model remembers that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola who does not "t should stand on the ear", although he is grateful to the city's administration that he has given his gremium the opportunity to affect this project "for the first moment."
He also notes that the nearby of the mountain to the city of the leading letter, which allows it to share the architectures to the debate, although he expresses his "double" if this technical profile calls multidisciplinary teams in life ("the right," he says), "We should only be a tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex because in the terms of the exhibition a global view of Collserola: "The 16 concurrents were expressed in the center," he says, "to the Axes Berge Sea, but there is no long-term perspective that considers the area in its entireness."
It led at least in his case that he participates in the 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the program and the definition of a project for a gate with the architecture of the gate.
His opinion should ensure that the city is directly on the Ronda de Dalt in his whole length, which is a serious transition between the city and the Green Zone.
Casino forgives Jonas Larazabal, the free comes
After 72 days smoking, the fulfillment of the Casino Red freed the brother of the citizens of Monterrey from the process that will be led against him because of the courageous expression.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonás Larazabal will be released after the fulfillment of the Casino Red was forgiven him before the second trial of the District, which leads to the process against the brother of the citizens of Monterrey's brother.
After the attention on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of the Casino Red, is a number of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas is to see, which must take him to pay a piece of money to apply the secret office of the Wethouse.
After the strategy, the State Government opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the panistic citizens who was established on 2 September for 30 days.
Four hours later with the Ministry of Public 3 and Delitos Patrimonials, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antigo of the main city.
In this place he stayed 49 days after a second challenge command, after the office of the Ministry Publico refused the crimes because of the rebellion and organizated crimes.
On October 19, he was transmitted to Cadreyta's Haft Institute, because he must have visited the owner of Casino Red with a half million Pesos. He remained only a few hours in the Mediterranean Security Treatment, because he proposed murders against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as the inhabitants of San Nicolás de Los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yanez, was established by the Secretary-General of the Second Crime of the District Jorge Yanez, which stated that there were evidence necessary for Jonah to speak to the payment of 1,5 million Pesos to the representative of the Vethouse, to open this in the case.
This Monday, the Commander of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gomez, requested the judge Joseph Luis Pecina, the brother of the citizen's master, to allow the crimes to be set in the next hours of free feet.
During the judicial audience, Ramiro Aria, the officer of the Court of Ministry Publico, Garcia Gomez, asked whether this was the worst, and whose owner of the Wethouse has excused his forgiveness.
According to the Act 197/2011, Jonas Larazabal will be spoken freely, and in the following case, there is no agreement against the process, and there is no requirement to be required.
Larazabal Breton was unexpectedly set on free feet after the Commander of the Wethouse at 15.50 hours.
The Secretary-General, Jorge Yanez, went to the citizen prison of San Nicolás de Los Garza to communicate Jonah that he was free and would put his case to the acts.
He also informed him of the legal arrangement on unrequired freedom.
The secretary Dionisio Perez Yacome provides detailed information on the aircraft in which the Government secretary Francisco Blake and more seven persons have come to life.
The Secretariat de Communications y Transports - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) reported that the investigation results on the accident where the Government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven other persons have come to life, indicating that the challenger has been directly discussed with his whole uninverse structure against the ground, without that the pilot could introduce a noteland.
At a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, secretary for communication and transport, that the pilot had confirmed that the visa conditions were applied to the airport before the start.
"The sachverhold that the proper flights were in 25 meters of height contacted with trees, where the hub shooter lost the shooting, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the smoker was built for 19 insects, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the person.
Moreover, he said that in the investigations on the area where the machine was achieved, no hub-screams were found.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the structure was covered by the entire structure.
The smoker was built for 19 insects, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of persons.
The area shows a smoking from 7 to 30 degrees.
Today, it is essential to achieve the results of research as soon as possible, however, these few months may even have a year.
Since it was confirmed by Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Services Auxiliares (secretariat for airports and support services in Mexico) that the aircraft flowed from the State Mayor Presidential at the airport speed and the aircraft was attached to a different distance.
"This information enhances the adoption that it has been done at the time of the planning on a normal airperson."
In a press conference, the leader of the SCT, Perez Yacome, was numbered six relevant points that should be considered at the investigation:
Visibility:
In accordance with the aircraft standards, there was an airport to the rules of the visibility, which means that the humanitarian has had to have been enough during the flight and on the ground.
Science conditions:
The AICM designed appropriate witting conditions during the start. During the next flight in direction on the border area between Mexico and Mexico, some deep clouds have gone up.
Selected flow sizes:
It is possible that the humanity had chosen a lower area with better view on the Cuernavaca Tal.
Application:
The posting coordinates and the last radar design of the shooter is agreed. Perhaps it has not given any control losses on the aircraft or a difference of the aircraft.
Distortion of the rest of the aircraft in a limited area:
The present information until this time indicates that the exploder was deployed from the right and sincere direction.
The pattern of the smoking air costs allowed that the hub shooter was explored on the ground with its uninverse structure.
No indications on burn or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft offers no explosion at the accident location or on the explosion.
The results of the recent investigation are referred to in several ground contacts.
In the studies of the area, the airport parts were found on a height of 9200 feet over the sea speed. The plane is amazing and shows a smoking from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the smoker probably has gone to breach.
Some information indicate that the hubschrauber could have received several ground contacts.
After a minute search on a area that was locked over the locked area in the accident, there were no aircraft parts found, which increased the adoption that the untransformed aircraft structure was discussed against the ground.
MSS provides a research protocol to find the gen for fetality
The social security organisation of Mexico leads a research project to find the gene for fetality in children and young people who are supported by IPN specialists.
The Mexican Instituto of Security Social - IMSS (Social Security Institute Mexican) noted that it was a research project to detect the gens for fetality in children and young people under the title "Genetic of Fetality in Childness and Young" which should be found in connection with the genetic marks.
Miguel Cruz López, leader of the Unit of Medical Research and Bioquímica (Department for Medical Research, Development of Biochemie) in the Clinic Hospital de Specialities del Centro Medical Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team was built by doctors, hospitals, food specialists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the post-graduated study in the National Health Institute of Public (INSP) and the research Centre and the Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Politecnico National Institute (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interests can come to the IMSS sports in the Valley of Mexico, where each week-day test is carried out from 8.00 hours with children and young people.
He noted that the research on the sportplace of Cuauhtemoc (in the West of Mexico) began and was continued since 8 October on the sportplace of Nezahualcoyolt (in East of the Mexican Agreement).
If the goal of 500 to 600 research persons is achieved, the study is continued on the sport of Independence (in the south of the main cities) and is concluded by Morelos (in the north of the main citizens).
He explained that the objective of the study was the learning of factors and the role of the Genetics in connection with the development of fetality and the identification of risk factors of Mexico children and younger in prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
Instead of the world's day of Diabetes, he explained that it would be trying to fulfill three thousand children and young people in the age of six to 14 years with the understanding of the understanding and with respect of their parents’ nutritional issues.
They will also be asked about their corporate activities and their family health prevention to control risk factors that can have diabetes or remote efficient efficiency.
He further expressed that in those samples, the research persons (fight, size, tail number) would be measured, controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glucosespegel, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (see the identification of genes in relation to the failure in the child's age).
Cruz López stated that this investigation would be carried out on the concern of health personnel on the alarming weight increase of young people.
"The health issues from 1999 and 2006 have been concluded that, at least six years of the part of the fatal boys in 77 per cent and the girls with fetality have taken a 47 per cent of the girls, and also the surface is dramatically attached," stated the IMSS specialist.
He said that the search for genetic marks was based because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from the other people.
He said that a (e) Mexico (in) in average of 65% of Indian Americans, 30% of Europe and 5% of African disagreement, which is in the genes that are with diabetes and override in relationship with.
In general, he explained that the Genetic of Fleetibility pressed himself in the inability to burn the overview of the energy (Calloria) to us, so that it would be incorporated in a form of flood.
The researcher explained that direct benefits for research participants would be in a sustainable study of children who would determine whether this is a degree of survey or fatality.
It would even investigate the convention of dark smokes in the neck and in the internal room (Akanthosis), which indicate the probability of substance changes and diabetes in the prestadium.
All information would be confidently treated and informed to the parents writtenly by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the sea, and make them amendments of lifestyle approved to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overflowing, failure and other chronic diseases: the movement man, which means missing movement in the whole day, the most time of the day before the television and use the transporter, instead of a short way to feed.
The high calorie capture, which means, is a higher consumption of suckered clothes and cool hydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.), together with a high-weight and white capture, and the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Offset of the UNAM prohibited sliders
Rafael Herrera, researchers in the chemical factory in the Mexico University, UNAM developed aspects modified with Polymeren to make the mixing against the scientific conditions and temperature changes
Whether the signs from the street board would not be necessary to repair about 200 000 shoes when the rain time in Zona Metropolitana del Valle de Mexico (State of the Valle of Mexico) said Rafael Mrera Najera, researchers on the factory for Chemie (FQ) at UNAM University, and ensures that if the exhibition and maintenance of the appropriation is approved, the number of struggles will be interpreted or completed.
In his proposal, "Teknical visions" which he, leaving the International Year to Chemie, he knew that the laboratory for which he is responsible to develop changed aspects with Polymeren to make a similar mixing that shows a larger mechanical resistance as well as at lower temperatures.
Mr. Najera said that this kind of changed affairs in areas with extremely heavy climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the maintenance of the street board and to delay the exploitation of smokers.
He explained that the asphalt - the serious part of the oil - is a cool water connection from which a part has a high molecular wheel - the so-called abstains - and the other part is a smaller - the so-called maltenes.
The zelastic behavior of the absorption means that it belongs to high temperatures of almost 180°C as a floor, at 120°C, he is very slow and fast fixed at 50°C while he is broken in very lower temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the abstention on the streets is not equal to the same, but, on one day, it has changed the vital conditions and temperature changes," the chemical engineer issued.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road board that was collected from six material ships, which contained the last three rooms.
between the top shields is a wound of asphalt required from small, in asphalt, and then steeled rocks.
Every single stones of this corruption steel were built in the asphalt.
If the vehicles continue to move on and create powers, this shield allows a good power distribution in the street board.
"If it would have been modified, the powers would be better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"On the fault,," he said, "we made a last shield, which is called a so-called garment of wind stones, e.g. from sand, which was also built in asphalt.
Since this shield is in contact with the vehicles, they need a greater mechanical power than the loss and it needs to produce the driving.
To receive and distribute the most powers of this street, the track also requires a suitable dick and the material of which it is, must be maintained.
The vital conditions, especially the temperature and temperature changes, are more, important to considerate factors, before all things the water," he said, "if it concerns the behavior of corruption.
When the water is feeded, the water goes into the skin and just goes hardly. This is caused to reveal all the skins of the streets, and follows the training of smokers.
When a smoke is found, he said, "We first decline the smoke, while the disorder is intrigued only after that, but the shame is not immediately, but it is a process that must be held in the first signs by appropriate management programmes."
The member in the National System of Investigators (National Research System Mexikos) explained that the vehicle carrier is a more important cause for the exploitation of smokers, and therefore the dick of each street is always in relation to the vehicle load, and it must be ensure that it will be included in order to prevent frequencies.
Rafael Herrera said that many research works were waiting for themselves, for example, on the absences that have already been in other countries, and with which the sliders were reformed easily and without the application of high temperatures.
What did the Kandidatin del Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors affected that Melina Ramirez Serna has not obtained the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th Miss Title.
Again, Valle del Cauca was empty when the crown for Miss Colombia was delivered.
This time Melina Ramiirez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winterpodium, a silver crown and the band that she shows it as a new Miss Colombia.
With the results of this night in Cartagena, where Mrs. Atlantico took the crone and the ceder, the Department already comes to the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had been maintained in the hands. To the proklamered mistakes: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Arenas (1987), Lega María (1988), Evonica (1989), María Consuela (1990), Diabella (1993), Garcela, Garcela (Gijulia) (2007), Al-Julina).
The great question that today is a lot, says: What's missing?
For the result, a great favorite who had shown at every exercise that she had been available over everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not usually chosen to the Queen of the Police and Master Rostro Jolie from Vogue, titles that also had received the beauty of Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and they took the crown of Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor that applies to the decision of the jury to renew it to the first Miss is that she didn't convince her response to the question "What book has affected you and why?" which was made by Martin Murillo Gomez from Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca said to the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a kind of civilization, just I think the book that preached for my childhood is the very strongest, the little prince, a right deep book.
Today, I read 'Schudd and Suhne'. It's a book of the universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book, which is called 'Leaderships'.
An answer to a little close love, first because of the term 'civilizing' and the second, because she did not clearly, in what way any of her book mentioned had influenced her.
But after the conclusion of Zeremonia, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it's what's going to happen.
And for all the people, 'The little 'the little prince', it's a great book.
On the other hand, the love of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota declared that the fact that she was the predicted that all the cases were the most secret and that were in the field all the prices (Gastronomy Concurrence of East, Public Agreement on the best handmaid costum and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made unbelievable what the Queen could not be stressed, therefore."
And this was noted at its first imagination in the bathroom at the shore of Hilton Hotel and on their two fronts at the royal room.
Although she was sure, she missed the power and the suffering that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic were looking for.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en house" at the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was crossed to Miss "with the candidate who wins most prices during the competition, finally will not be a Queen."
Furthermore, Valle went to conclude the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about its interest for social work, which is recently the most important of the national beauty competition.
It's already his reason that two days before the international Julie Lucy Dotty's composition, they looked for a woman who was involved in the social issues of their country.
"The beauty is not enough for a Miss Columbia, but you have to look at the body and focus on the social emphasis that she had already cooperated with projects before the participation of competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that the valle with her defects of the decree and the fibrose which you have noticed in the magnitude, but it is contraried, because the jury chose them as a candidate for the “natural beauty” with a healthy body, good food habits and more responsible organ work.
The trainer of the kings, Jorge Hernán Orosco, says that Melina did not have the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrose in the boat, which was honestly said to me, pressed her point in the last day."
During that time, the journalist Guido Hoyos was the view of Cromos, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the chirurgical income that she had submitted.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how they should do it right.
Her body was never their strong side, and this place had to pay them."
This price, which is first forgiven by the National Beauty Concurrence, has become a gracious prevention that should be true in the night. It was surprised that Raymundo Melina had given a suffering price to not leave them into the genius of the crown.
Not if that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is from today its rulership year, though not as a king, but as Princess, a position you offer the possibility to rename the National Beauty Concurrence Colombia at one of the international competition.
However, she will be as one of the kings who, although her overwhelming approach for Cartagena, entered the crown into the history.
That was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscope from Cali went as the man who identified the "Alfonso Cano" in the history.
The work of these officers plays a key role.
In the past 4 November, a loofs copy of the State Agency (CTI) was confirmed as a man of the FARC leader's identity (Fuerza Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Combat forces of Colombia), confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints.
Since the seven Lophoscopes in the CTI Division, this week Eliazar González had worked with a man from Puerto Tejada since 21 years in criminal treatment procedures.
At the beginning of his carriers, González worked in the churches of Choco, where he often had to put up five days in the jungle to get the place where the bodys should be identified.
2000 he split into the Valle and after the fulfillment of the required curse, he specificized himself in lophoscope, this is the investigation of the hair that has been issued, such as the hand- and footboards.
In the week of the use against the Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was suggested to pack a clothing for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
Friday night, he flowed in the room of Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodys, and that the conscience was that one of the man who led the old Guerrilla of the world could be able to take the ten-finger board of Guillermo Leon Saenz (the real name).
Nevertheless, when he met the researcher arrived the place where the body was found, he could not identify him because of his body appearance, because this was compared to the images he had seen in the media.
He had no bar, he was like a builder of the region, no brill and was very dark.
But the fingerprints do not lie.
Weapons with a lupe, title, a plant cell and a tax lamp corresponding to Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the table.
He had seen right, it was "Alfonso Cano".
In the same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was to communicate to the Ministry of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually acting on the head of the FARC.
Search for the shirts
For a Dactyloskope from Sijin in Cali was the conviction that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González had been assigned to a press-conference on the use against "Cano".
Many people don't know our job.
The Daktyloscope is a exact science without a bug cost that can be a key factor in the solution of a crime.
Lophoscopes identifie not only bodys, they also support assaults in murders and ransoms and confirm identity of those who are determined.
In their presence, many criminals have a false indicator or they have no.
We take them the fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to cut a piece of wall out of a house with a debtor, because the deb was just rolled up on this place with his hand when he went out with a smoke and money locked out.
"Where are difficult because their surfaces are inadequate for the absence of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the expression of the whole hand and identify the criminals who had shared in several debts," he remembered.
Aids of fingerprints can also be loaded or loaded.
Before the shortzem, a dead was found by snapsflags.
In the meditation, a family member could be effectively sustainable, and actually, a fingerprint was agreed on the floor.
Although it doesn't guarantee that it is about the murder, he will be taken into account the place where the crime has been carried out.
A dactyloskopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagencies."
If it appears, a plant cell or a band will be used to be taken.
Then the expressions will be sent to the Asif, this is the criminal database, or to the person.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without evidence", explained the CTI expert.
He said not everything like it was shown in the TV SCI series.
As not all gold is, it's not all that you're looking at, a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if you conduct a corresponding comparison.
The "Imports" require the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrants were joined together at the succotti-platz.
A large part came to the room command and changed his location to a nearest park.
The members of the movement of the Ocupy Wall Street requested the officers of New Yorks on this day when they were trying to reach a legal arrangement, after they were dreamed in the morning room and tried to set another place in Big Apple.
Thursday, hundreds of demonstrants were joined before the succotti-platz, on which they were with a legal arrangement that allowed the "emptors" the renewed soldiers to make progress. In the meantime, there was another part of the movement to the Room Command and placed a park continuously north in the city where it came to nine festivals.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp on the place, we find us together in another place and continue the fight with legal media to return to the custody, with seat-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray expressed that the answer of the "emplements" to the room of his celllagers, which was directed by Michael Bloomberg, the citizens of New York, until the court came, where the judge Lucy Billings had made a order that prohibited the powerful room of the place and the demonstrants accepted the cells.
Furthermore, the "Emports" included a new park, which is connected to the cross of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, close to the income in Holland Tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church.
They could place at least one hour, but then the police came in and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact numbers. He ensures the message agent Efe that he also saw several journalists with trade schools.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people had been found in this position, in which religious leaders were also encountered as signs of their support of the members of the movement and to address the police.
In the meantime, the succotti-platz (in private identity) remains closed in expectation of a legal hearing which is still established for this Sunday and should be analyzed by the legality of the rooms found in the morning.
Some of the demonstrants explored by the place took photographs of this legal arrangement and distributed them. They also gave some copies who watched the place, what "the small meetings" had to follow, as Bray reported, who showed that some police had been shocked by demons.
The legal indication offers the authorities to room members of the Occupy Wall Street and the application of "acts that have been proposed after the purpose and to prohibite the demonstrators with their sellings and other things they have already used to return to the park."
City Master Bloomberg explains that, because of this legal arrangement, the renewed opening of the place for the public transport and the demonstrants have been raised. The demonstrants, as he pointed out, would not allow them to set up the citizens with silver and sleep sacks on this place.
The citizen officer deserved personally the room of the Cuccotti Platze in the morning, which has been set at about 200 persons, and the decisions were decided because the demonstrators are "distorced to the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement to the room of the place, because this was "this turned to a place where people didn't come to demonstrie, but to break the laws and in some cases to add other people's worms" because "their business had received drugs" and the inhabitants feared "for their quality of life."
"The room in the Morning Greece was worthy and shows that Bloomberg, based on the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North America's workers," added the speaker to the movement that the citizens accused, "not respect the price freedom."
The responsibilities of "Occupy Wall Street" reported that they were looking forward to organize "grande actions" for the Sunday, and however, together with communi organizations and businesses, to remember the two months that protests since 17 September have already been remembered.

The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens assistent in "Home Improvement", a saving whitherin in "Baywatch", Kaninchen in "Playboy", the wife of the Rock musicist Tommy Lee, and now the shoes and models will be the girlfriend of the Canadian TV.
The private telescope CTV has known today that Anderson has arrived together with the "crooner" (Balls) Michael Buble and other Canadian passengers on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special girlfriend Mary's life.
CTV has expanded today photos from the television program, in the Anderson - also for the browsing on the Internet a self-round pornos, where they are with her old husband, the shooter player of "Mortley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - as a girlfriend Mary with a puppet in the shooter that should show Jesus.

Japan is born after the earthquake
The BIP grows up to 1,5% thanks to the inland consumption and ends the free case from the beginning of March
Since the last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which still was in the Genesis after the destroyed earthquake, which was in atomic crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had had lived in the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government in Tokyo evaluated the cases of $300,000, a rate that seems to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be achieve.
After three quarters, the data on Bruttoinland product were served by July to September to conclude this chapter: the BIP increased 1,5% in comparison to the previous quarter and 6% to the high-recented quote in the year.
The second quarter measured value - in Japan, the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period of January to March 2010.
The recovery can be declared partly by the sale of machines for the rebuilding areas of the earthquake and the following Tsunami.
In fact, the enterprises increased their investments to 1,1% in comparison to the return of 0,9% for capital bills signed from January to March, the first return after six months.
However, the real transformation of Japan's economy is not only from the keyshian urgents that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
In particular, Japan is expected by the development of the indigenous consumption, which now increases 60% of the Japanese BIP.
This variable increased to 1%, approximately the growing expenditure for vehicles, traveling and free-time employment.
The Yen Stigma
Tokyo has convinced the Inland market after the Yen - the Japanese monetary - in one of the investors who flew before the Eurozone's criminal crisis and the trial prognoses for the U.S.A., a privilege that loads a grave stone on the accounts of the export undertakings.
With a worst monetary, the products in the foreign country are more severe, a serious problem for a country whose economy is on the health of great technologies.
Toyota and Sony, for example, brought their weak business results from July to September to the notification of Yen.
While the markets continue to attach the peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshiko Noda remains growing.
"Man has to take care of the risks continuing, for example, to disturb some foreign economys, the effects of the surveys in Thailand and the fast assessment of the Yen," said the State Secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very upright.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) declared that most Member States in September would have shown clear signs for the desire of economic development.
The indicator, which predicts the endpoints of the world economy, made light that the bremse would go to the largest economic potential.
Because he's sat about four tenths to 100,4 points in comparison to the 100,8 in August.
The Eurozone is even under this average value, which is at least 100, after it is eight decades to 99,13 points.
Athens can be doubled again
Papadimos says that the exploitation measures would be agreed, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement.
Greece is also raised in the Labyrinth, which is carried out from the great European crime.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greece transitional government is more reacting to the pressure of Brussels as a real convincement of the political powers, will be reached easily by the facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday indicated that there is no alternative to the structure reforms and that the hundred days were possible to be shortly for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Partie Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, ensures that he supports the new separations and will never take his request for new choices on the date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this Government is the implementation of the decisions held on the board of 26 October," confirmed Papadimos yesterday to open a Parliamentary debate, which will be achieved tomorrow with the confidence of the new government.
A package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reforming the discipline right for employees and new measures against stealing is the first initiatives.
However, Samara's communication does not say, "We have committed us to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The Conservative Leader has been a long step with its requirement of the EU and the IWF, the organization that has to lock the 8000 million needs of the athens, and he has made clear that he would not apply the obligation statement on the fulfillment of the exploitations.
But the European Commission, which has still been irrigated in the effects of the poker game with papan3u reference, has been forced yesterday, not to cut down their request: the economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the most important Greek parties would be signed "un unfortunately as soon as possible."
The speaker of the Economic Ministry, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika "best soon" return to Athen to talk to the new government, "What for the payment of the sixth section" in higher than 8000 million euros, although there is no final date.
The Greek kneel is still for a long time.
Queen Sofia: "This is tools for progress and hope"
The Queen noted the "pre-hering" position of Spain in relation to this financial type
Spain "that has a pre-governmental position in the role of smaller funding."
Yesterday, the Queen Sofia of Spain reminded that Spain has developed in the past two-year-year-old world for the second speed for the international cooperation; that is "What" that it works for a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity on the basis of confidence in humans".
She was sure that it was "no doubt" that this kind of businesses would be "absolutely irresponsable" to get the years of the United Nations up to 2015 and "in particular the target of people who have to live with less than one dollar day, so under the "harmuth limits".
Spanish "continuing to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "as in the last road of the world and it brings this task full responsibility," noted the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that are achieved from the gipfel to the Sunday, "the creation of new capacitys and better opportunities for the worst and especially for women" as the main beneficiary of these leaders.
"We have signed a lot of success" and "We have a lot of needs against."
It is not only a forum for the debates but also a platform for the name of "two basic goals".
The Queen explained that it would be required that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services until the end of 2015 and that ten million of these budgets will override the poverty limits.
The concept of the smallest credit is returned in Spain and the rest of the world on the "initiated way of Muhammad Yunus for years" which the Queen of Sofia is a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "wunderful idealists who wrote the fight against the poverty" and his work they knew since 15 years when the Queen went to Bangladesh to learn the Darling Strategy.
On this experience, a year later, the first worldwide field in Washington and more meetings in the eleven office in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "We can watch a continual development," the Queen, whose commitment for this project, explained to her last night the evaluation as "Family Noverage" in Valladolid and as "Firmary of Arms".
Finally, the Queen Sofia concluded its proposal by animating the advantages to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in fight against the poverty.
"The Ethical Order"
The Spanish Foreign Ministry Trinidad Jiménez, however, said that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the whole democratic State.
In this sense, she stated that it was a mistake to bind development assistance in times of economic trees, which is a "continuous obligation".
Jiménez was the view that the smallest credits were a "the first and rigorous policy to destroy the poverty", and that the governments of the industries should now "forever" work after solidarism criteria, and they could not allow solidarity of the crisis to be sacrificed.
For Spain, the smallest credits are one of the most important forms of development assistance.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, announced "the success", "marginalised" people, "the stood before closed doors" " hope" and the citizen master of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, called the advantages in a city, opening the "Your Tower, Attracted by the Spirit of Solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU Presidents in accordance with the general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christmas Democratics (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, delivered for Angela Merkel, Kanslers and President of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally proposed in the programme, but it has been inherited in particular to lead enough to the activeists that the Government Policy on Greece today and may be Italian tomorrow to lax.
The proposed proposed by the Presidency of the European Commission was nearly adopted.
Under 1001 delegated voted only nine-days, the ten had the voice.
The number of minutes in statement Ovation, which, first of their intervention Members, bought Angela Merkel and some hours later Wolfgang Schuble, was not open since the three European Financial Ministers.
The main idea of the cancers - as the requests - the following Slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also "new million workplaces are directly dependent on the euro."
For the cancers "the time has come to a break in Europe."
This could be expressed by a strengthening change of the Lisbon Treaty on the European Union's budget policy in the eurozone; but it could also be made a view in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote."
This is, however, at any case, one of the proposals of requested by the Congress, whose clear wolf shooting shooble pate.
It's probably just a little probable that the 47s are quickly on this revolution: Great Britain's matter is anxious, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
But the meelstein is laid down.
The delegated delegated in a overwhelming majority have also rejected the proposal of the weight of each country in the ECB in accordance with the weight of individual economics, which, obviously, increased the position of Germany.
The candidates concerned in their party, therefore, have increased the reference points to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cool, but she has not yet tried to win its congress on the costs of the "people" or that in the difficulties of European countries that would impropriately criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the European request of the "the German-Francian friendship" refers to a paragraph, Angela Markel France calls not on the plan.
Not at least directly.
Because this reminds that Leipzig was in the middle of a bloody struggle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most deepest deadlines of the polelonic army.
What is the representation of the disorders in hospitals?
After family supports, the UMP and the Government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be held on the Sunday on 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family aid case and to bring a talk about the - since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social combat and economic dependence from the State.
In order to apply this attack, which is exhausted by the effort to put the economy into a heavy test, but on the other hand, no less proposal for a axis of the right president campaign, the majority will focus on employment diseases.
First with household economic goals: the Government indicates the introduction of a fourth day of carenship before the consideration of a disease to workers in the private sector.
It means, in Germany, that a patient employer would lose the reward of four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure to be taken by the day-time"Les Echos' wrath, however, would help to bring 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic characteristics with another measure were going to include the State officers to enter a non-profit day in the disease case (for them, in accordance with the three carency days in the private sector, no caren period).
While these issues are in the discussion, most of them also deal with the newly-new thematics, which will be attached to the dismissibility of work.
"The controls will be essentially more important, and these refunds are to be paid if it is required," warned Xavier Beyond the Sunday, on 13 November, before the Microphone of the RTL sender.
As also in other cases, the effects of this message seems to be unproportioned in the reality of employees in the fields of disease reports.
This is, in fact, since 2002, a permanent monitoring and political openings that have been often fruit.
Frances are not more frequently sick than people in Europe.
However, let's make the first degree in the country-wide numbers.
According to the CNAM disease cases, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, the day findings in 2008 have been established with 11,3 billion euros 5% of the health expenditure.
In this amount, 46% of the maternity supply and employment accidents and 54% related to disease, which is now 6,2 billion euro.
And then 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frances in 2009 have been able to meet only 14,5 disease studies in the Alma Consulting Group in 2009.
An average value, which has been exposed by some differences: another, in 2007, from Monster.com, the website for Carriere Planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40,000 were asked to provide French workers to take no one-day hospital.
Another, this time by the hospital insurance studies explains that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 was shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
As compared to their European neighbors, the French workers are therefore not more than to work hardness.
In 2010, two researchers of the French, State Centre for Scientific Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence quote (infected in disease or other ways) were oxilated, and that in France, between 10% and 11%, 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The injury of disease reports provides a disagreement of a lower part in respect of the black work.
On the basis of the relief, there will be only a weak expression.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002, the systematic controls in patients have over 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (publicary high school for the education and further education of technology and engineers) has detected 1,5 million controls that 13% of 285,000 of the realized, short-term disease reports, which are in 37,050 cases, were right or too long."
In the systematical controlled disease cases of more than 45 days, the number of 1,2 million of 11% was not adjusted or unjusted" cases that have been 132,000.
So this makes 169,000 unrighteously" cases of several million workers who have carried out a disease.
A number that represents only a weak expression, for example, those of the black work.
According to the UMP Advisory Dominique Tian, the representative of a report showed in July on this question, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro ratefall per year, such as more than the total costs of day rewards, and thus more than the recent defraudation.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece has needed a new adjustment program to take away his economy.
This reported on Monday on 14 November of the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before the Parliament, under the adoption of the fact that his Government was not enough for a hundred days since the Union to make this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support of our European partners and a new budgetary programme," said the Government team in his first public talk in the opening of the debate on the confidence of the Parliament on the Mediterranean.
The implementation of the European Affairs on 27 October decisions is the "First Upgrade" of the new Government, since the impact of the country within the Eurozone' on the game is added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papademos has planned the State Deficit for the 9% of Bruttoinland products from today to the end of the year after it was 10,6% in 2010 and at 15,7% in 2009.
The rights decline the new exploitation measures
Antonis Samaras, leader of the right flight, had given his agreement to the already agreed measures in accordance with the Agreement of the Crisis of Corruption, but suggested that his parties would not be prepared for additional adoption.
"We will not be able to vote the most profitable new measures," he said, "the party's new democracy is a deputy collection.
He was ready to declare with the proposals of reduction of budget deficits and crimes, as well as to fight the consumption, to entrusted every political policy that would link the economic development.
Olli Rehn, convinced by the European Commissary of Economic and Monetary Tasks, prohibited that IWF and the EU would not release more than 8 billion euros without write guarantees of all parties on their support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and not signed under pressure.
Euthanasia and a joint freedom must be legalised if an expert remote
Canadians live in refusation of death as a report of the King society of Canada
The Gremium explained that governments, health Institutions and doctors have cooperated with respect to painful treatment to prepare the best painful measures, and that is also about blood cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal against death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about conditions where they want to die and take provisions to this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the King Society of Canada, which has been involved in six experts related to different areas, including Ethic, law and medicine.
This Greece recommends the Government to amend the criminal health in order to allow the associated Suicide and Euthanasia, where this choice is placed, and however, in patients who are considered in a situation to take such decision.
As an attract, experts quot a recently published question of an independent IAU society, which compared the dead quality in 40 countries of the landball.
Although Canada has placed up on the 10. Rang, the study notes that "the medical death relief in Canada has produced a culture in which people have feared to reject the subject of death."
Medical treatment or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to painful medicines, tell us the experts of the King Society of Canada.
And although the majority of the Canadians want to die to home, 68,6% of these in the hospital.
From the whole country, the Council with 86% in the hospital has been considered at the highest level of death accidents in Quebec.
In the respective question about Eutanasia and Suizid, the representatives of the report on conclusions that have already revealed the position of the Federal Government will not be addressed to any amendments of the Court of Justice in respect of Eutanasia and the attached Suicide.
However, now there is no evidence that the experts who have inspectioned the same term all those countries who have legalized or criticized the adoption of Eutanasia and the associated Suicide, there is no evidence that such a criminalized mi-criminalism in their application, so that the practice of Eutanasia or the competent suicide of uncompetent or non-competent persons would go to themselves.
In addition, there are more cases of such transgressions just in countries in which Eutanasia and the associated Suizid are not legalized, as yesterday Jocelyn Downee, the composer of the report confirmed in a teleconference.
"Authanasia is practiced in Canada where she is absolutely illegal."
"Anyway, the attached Suizid is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downee.
Canadians encouraging the Eutanasia
We appreciate that, according to an Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of the Canadians have already reached the most beneficiary of Eutanasia, because they are the opinion, they have stopped people in the end of their life path to decrease their pains.
And 66% believe that the achievement of the legalization of the Eutanasia does not have the consequence of distributing the message that the life of older or unnecessary people have a lower value.
With regard to the persons who have already practiced a associated Suizid, the questionnaires represented to 41% the opinion that they should not be tried to persecute.
In the case of retaining or setup of the medium in patients, the situation is less clear, so the reporter.
It also indicates that in their recommendation, it should be indicated in the case of crime that the expenditure of the measures for a legal adoption should not be applied as criminal.
The expert ringium suggests that the faculties of the health care should be made in the task to respect the measures in the end of life, and that must be feared without criminal persecution.
The Gremium explained that governments, health institutions and doctors have cooperated with respect to painful treatment in order to prepare the best painful measures, and it also has gone out of blood cases.
Finally, the Gremium requests to take into account the measures already used in the Canadian Institutions for Health Agreements to reduce physical pains and to reduce the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the law of health care have already submitted advantages on the conclusions of the expert report of the Kingdom Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has marked the maintenance of the reported experts in others as "extrem" because these of the Eutanasia practice in the hospitals in the final phase have no border.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone who lives and is older than 18 years is to ask another person to be helpful to him in his own death," so RA Deschamps, who had discussed the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also indicates that the report's representatives appeared to make the own responsibility of individuals over all other values involved in the society.
But now, he says that it's "leaderships and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist for Health Act, also has made a strong resistance against the conclusions of the report, which they were referred to as "Pro-Euthanasia-manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Canadian Republic of Canada, is, in particular, the reports on the inexistence of misbreaks in certain countries in which Euthanasia and the associated Suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad to the Making Agreement
Damascus runs a "complott"
Syrian is obviously isolated
Partisans Baschar al-Assads have shown yesterday before the authorities of the Audient Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, however, has included the support of Russia and has reached a "Complott" against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria through the Arab Liga, the European Union has broken their sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbors of Syria, have made the position of the president Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan was yesterday the officer of the Arab Prime Minister, the President Baschar al-Assad requested it, "the officer was killed in Syria for the fourty civilists and members of the Government.
"If Baschar is the interest of his country in heart, he would decline, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new surface of the Syrian political life," so the king of Jordan, nearbarland Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomatic captain Ahmet Davidoglu concluded that from the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime, Turkish remediation trials were not successful.
"Themen in the Middle East, who are not in peace with their people and can't be satisfied, have to go," he explained in the playing of Syria, the neighborhood country, to which Turkish will be able to be able to be able to be fulfilled.
The United States have also welcomed the "consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" in accordance with the decisions of the Arab Liga and the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liga and the countries such as Turkey have been attached to the repressions in Syria, a sound that is always worse," observed Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During that time, 16 civilists and at least 19 members of the Government authority have been dead in Dar'a region in South Syria, thus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH reported.
Two other civilians were referred to this NGO to "show changes and severe bombs to Jobar" in the hosted city Homs.
In addition to a press conference, the Syrian Minister Walid al-Muallim was the view that the country's stealing to the end of the crisis."
He, however, reacted to the decision of the Arab Liga, the Damascus of his tasks, reacted to his appreciation after a "risk step".
"Don't give the Syrian values," added, "the complicated complots would be missed against Syria."
According to the decision on supplementation of Syria, the Arab Liga now investigates a "protection mechanism for civilists" and wants to send 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, media and military monitors in the country.
The French Ministry of Eastern Trade Alain Juppé also expressed the benefit of UNO observers to protect civilists before the repression of the regime, that he was captured after his "Paranoia" to be protected by side.
An open planning new meeting of the Liga is proposed tomorrow in Rabat to promote the implementation of the plans decided on 2 November to the crisis expenditure, especially the restriction of the prospective of the military forces from the cities concerned and the liberation of prisoned demonstrates.
The Russian Officer Sergej Lawrow has adopted the decision of the Arab Liga last night as "incorrect" to protect any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already recommended to implement the crisis growth plan.
Italy
Monti requests the markets to patient and Italy to offer sacrifices
Mario Monti, the future Italian Government team has required the markets a little more time to make its stage and to convert a programme to require "of the victim" to reach the loss of credit rate during the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The ancient EU Commissary had been discussing the political parties yesterday before the current meeting of business and workshops.
It was his task to call a cabinet to the Parliament that is related to the strictly combined from external technology.
"Monti has spoken from a major programme with a number of victims," so Francesco Nucara, the representative of one of the most smaller, to the parlamentaristic groups that were discussed after he was met with the officer President.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Secretary-General, had not expected to expect that Mario Monti has made the Parliament a confidential vote to ensure that the new government is available for sufficient support.
The discussions will be presented in the presentation of Mr. Monti of a separation list, which will doublely be rich from a thousand ministers to the State Board of Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented, the severe Nervosity of the bodies and obligations markets requested their time.
In the "one democracy there are some periods" to prepare a government and a government programme, he noted that the markets would be duplicated and comprehensive.
His mandate by the President was welcomed by the markets, but the disruption was renewed, especially after an unexpected industry production in the Eurozone in September.
The Ministry of Prime Minister should be attached to an existing stave of preceding technology, although he had said that it would like to join the "political" policy.
The new government should be only until 2013, the date of the next Parliament's elections, so he evaluated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Secretary-General, the new Government should receive the trust evidence of the Parliament until free.
Mr. Monti has been committed to work in all the senses of the goal to make Italy to "new protagonists" in Europe since he has taken its function.
A speaker of the Commissioner of the EU Olli Rehn had not mentioned that "the fact that our diagnosis against the Italian economy itself has not changed in consideration of the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome has not obtained its objective of the budget comparison in 2013 instead of the sparning plans taken in these last months, has requested new harmony measures.
Emma Marcegalia, "Chefin of the Chefs" Italian, which is meeting on Monti on Sunday, is also on the need of the economic curve", where a country that does not have any growth that cannot respect deficitical identification digits."
Mr. Monti, who is known for his competence and its independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), is for a "epochen change" Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Prophet" symbolizes the "the requirement of confidentiality" and a "Other Italy", such as the leadership authors.
The biggest unknown is the length of his staves.
President Napolitano would like to prevent the proposed elections since Italy has now arrived for 200 billion euros from April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iran Kernel Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a nuclear weapons with a nuclear weapons, so confirmed a specialized at the month, American NGO.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS bases on the recent report of the International Agency for Atom Security and others, documents issued by this UNO Agency to address this scientist.
The AIEA has communicated its "extreme interest" in the last week a "possible military size" of the Iran Nuclear Programme.
According to the incoming study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, the Danielko was born 1934 openly from the beginning of the 60s over three decades in a soviet military nuclear centre in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamants produced by the explosion.
1989 or 1991, he must leave the center to build a company in Kiew, which produces "Nano Diamants".
The economic difficulties of his companies had been led to him in 1995 to contact the Irish message in Ukraine.
Before he returned to Russia, he has then affected an Iran program from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA's strong indication that the Iranian Development's a nuclear price system's supported by the work of an external expert, which is not only in this technology, but as a Member of the Agency reported, his whole employment carriers on this technical technology were directly working on the military nuclear energy program of its origin.'
Anti-islamic crimes and delicts have taken 50%
The crimes and delicts against Muslims have increased from 2009 to 2010 to 50%, where other rasistic or religious motivated violent crimes have been reached in the same period as the FBI statistics published in the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes violated by 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, so to increase 49%, where 13% of the soldiers against Catholics, a 4% reduction against the Jews and a global increase of 14% against anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number "hassmotivist crime" has increased in a very low maine of 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by race difference and 20% by motivated crimes of religion, so the FBI.
"After a disagreement in 2009, it is urgent to see these crimes and crimes again," the human rights organization noted."The growth of anti-islamic military is particularly significant," added the organization to a communique.
"Human Rights first had a long time to indicate that the violent violence against Muslim should be addressed, as well as all forms of hass crimes as a severe law contrast against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsor of the organization.
"The American Government can and should be done more for the fighting of these attacks," he concluded that it could be done under improvement of the police holding against the "hass crime".
The "Hass crime" is in the United States Agreement Act as an inheritance from the age of the fight against civil rights.
This legislation was agreed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to violate soldiers who are guided against race, heat color, religion or abuse, and now also relates to sexual relationship.
Twitter walks the platform and always likes more Facebook
The Microblogging Website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform in order to allow their users to monitor the activities of those who follow their items, which allows the service to compare more to the Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" can be more read-leading follow-ups of other "Twitters", the Internet user whose messages are followed and followed by your messages.
This allows you to find whether these are allowed to follow their messages if they subscribe new contributions, favorize certain messages etc.
This new Twitter-menu offer was dedicated before his general Internet distribution on Montag'im August in a low percentage of users, the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner was introduced before the French Press AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functions, confirmed with something istherical anmutendem Wordlaut (RT to review the contribution of another person). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) make the happiness of the initiative, so opens a more larger public with a manner more comparable to the larger public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"This is inutile, extraordinary and similar to very Facebook," writes @emb123.
"The function "Activity" will help me to follow certain elements of my flux-Twitters better," announced @dannycronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "good budget rule" in the consideration
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided on the Sunday to adopt a "Golden budget rule" in order to reduce public deficits and to prevent an eventual degradation from rating agents in the top-based Austria (AAA).
It was the social democratic candidate Werner Faymann who had noticed this decision of the outcome of the Ministry Council, although the public Austrian Court was 74.6%, the criteria set out by the Maastricht Treaty, however, clearly below the judicial level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capacity does not pay for an AAA on AA+, then we should pay three billion euros additionally," argumented Michael Spindelegger, Vize Canzler and Christian Democratic Ministry.
Austria also provides a request of the Brussels' currency of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: States and Government captains would have required to take a public deficit reduction until the end of 2012 and a return to public accounting equality in the comparison of or by allowing a equal law.
The measure adopted by the Austrian Government is like the "the German model", since Germany was the first European country that had taken such "regulates".
Since 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0,75% of Bruttoinland products (BIP), since 2017 the structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% of the PIB, where regional states should also demonstrate the competent budgets.
The objective is to reduce 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Stark Yen
Noda, with a new intervention on the monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda warned on the Sunday that the Japanese Officer would again intervene on the monetary markets if the Yen should continue.
"If we set a excessive volatility" in the change course of Yen, we will also intervene as we have done it last time," said Mr. Noda in the Senat.
On the Sunday, the Yen was raised close to the historical level that the Japanese authorities had requested to intervention on 31 October.
In this day Tokyo sold massive Yen against dollars to send the Japanese Devise value to establish a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the Yen has been regularly increased by purchases of investors, which consider the Yen as a "avoid value" in these increasing times of global economy disagreement and consumption crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen under 77 Yen in the Sunday, the euro has been cut down under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the level that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar reported about 120 yen, the euro is more than 160 yen.
This Japanese Devise smokes the exports of the archipel because it defends the costs of the "made in Japan" products and reduces the income values from Japan from the outland, because these are increasing them in a country currency.
"Japan fights after the ground and the Tsunami on 11 March, who have destroyed the Tohoku region (Nordoku), for his rebuilding,," states Mr. Noda, who fears that this age of Yen may already kill the weak storm in Keime.
The third Economic Fourth Government has reached the growth in the third quarter-1.5% in comparison to the previous quarter-for the first time in this year, as well as the sustainable exports and the consumption of the "plombed" budgets of the catastrophe.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the smoking of Yen does not reflect the economic functions of Japan.
Financial Ministry Jun Asumi, on the basis of the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee, requested to take all the considerable measures to achieve the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, representative governor of the Institute, however, has set out in awareness that the BoJ has already been "associated measures" that he reads that no additional locking on the Mediterranean is not expected.
In the end of October, the notebank has increased its state obligations for $5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euro) to access the 55,000 billion Yen (519 billion euro) payments for the purchase of various financial titles to overcome the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Smooth feeds fast in the height, balls make backwards
Infinitely, the risk of accusation of criminal crisis is the European consciousness.
Instead of the Office of the new Government bodies in Greece and Italy and the best growth in France and Germany, the Councils of the country concerned continue.
The bulls who are still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone also have been deployed on 15 November for a few more in negative fields.
In Paris the CAC died at 10:4% and fell on 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt returned to 0.4%, London to 0.1%.
"Because the new spendings relating to the residences of the state liability in which the Eurozone is in difficulties, the worldwide activity market continues to make a part of its recent winning.
"The Captain Leaders are nervous and only knowing the risk of attachment," says Terry Pratt, institutional brokers at the IG market, quoted by the Presidency Reuters.
The bulls in Tokyo, which, at its renewed fear of the market participants, in relation to the capacity in Europe, suggested that the criminal crisis was closed with a range of 0.7%.
"Japan has also set his eyes on Europe as the rest of the world, and the trade moves to a limited variation curridor, while the leaders have no evidence that the situation has been stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewing of concern on the future of the Eurozone is the unity currency that continues to be based on the Sunday.
The Euro moves from one half months at its latter level.
At 10 hours, the European Valuta was $1.3570, so it was $0.4%.
According to the officers, the CDU, the party of the Canzler Angela Merkel, who had gathered together in the Congress, had made a request, in particular, the possibility of existing countries to go out of the Eurozone without to leave the European Union simultaneously.
The Italian and Spanish Councils are lower than 6%.
The delegations of the Italian and Spain continue to be on a very comfortable level.
This morning, the rest of Italian obligations were achieved at 10 years 6,85% of the Spanish Title was 6,2%.
These spendings of the cigarettes in the southern countries, but also in France, continue the fear of the leaders.
The future Italian Government boss Mario Monti requested the markets more time to restore the situation in Italian caused by the ransom.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October by the Eurozone's rules were "the main design" of his Government.
Spain is in the market view, since the Parliament's elections are located on the Sunday.
The Chinese skin ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-year obligations has reached a new, historical high.
In expectation of the growth of the eurozone
Statistically discovered France a growth of 0,4% in third quarter of the budget, so a little better than the expected 0,3%.
However, the Statistical Budget INSEE had reviewed the grounds of the numbers of the second quarter, and with a minus of 0,1% of the Bruttoinland products (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are most involved.
Germany had to sign a growth of 0,5% in the same period.
A first higher calculation of the whole eurozone will be expected for 11 hours, while the EU Commission warnings the risk of a renewed reserve.
Energy policy:
The facts should be raised over dogs
There is a subject that can not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or by emotions, it is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affect directly the companies and the competitive capacity of the companies.
It is reasonable to take an electronic tracking on this subject and on the position of the nuclear energy.
The debate will only bring fruit when it is solving the total economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
Frances should fund their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, the demographic evolution has a duplication of the electricity demand until 2050, it is not necessary to reflect a large part of the world population on a vital element.
In the same time, it is necessary forgetting the resources of fossil to continue to produce competent electricity without the low need to reduce the gas gas missions, one of the ecological debates, to forget to fight climate injustices.
Fukushima's accident does not change this parameter.
Therefore, Germany continues to isolated in his decision to resist nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium that makes its decision of the need to find a replaceable source, or in Switzerland, which is just attempt to build the nuclear power works of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to continue to rename only some countries, their projects continued to be resolved.
The United States decided to leave their park another unit by receiving the work three Miles of the Atomfall.
Although it is directed to renewable energy sources, the German model is obviously submitted as a model, however, the reality of the discussion is against.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a defense of the electricity price, which increased energy dependence in import gas, in particular Russia, to reduce the increase of CO2 emissions distorted by gas and coal operations.
The total of these unfaithful effects will be observed within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives anxiety to think.
The Danish is one of the European Table Leaders of Wind Energy, from which 30% of its electricity, otherwise, the country is one of the most powerful users of cool and gas, which is used by wind energy; thus its CO2 Austria and its electricity prices are about 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average value.
Thanks to the powerfulness of our energy policy, our neighbors pay amount of 40% higher electricity calculation in accordance with our French budgets.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role of competitive capacity and a stability of the industry on national grounds, French enterprises have a contribution for the most beneficial electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction on the atom force would therefore be a strong growth of the energy price, which will be able to re-industrialise our country and the protection of the purchase of the potential to the illusion.
Requirements have concluded that the price that the largest majority of Frances also is prepared to pay a little bit as they can recognize resistance against the principle of this energy source.
We appreciate that the energy policy has allowed our country to build a industrial route directly with 125,00 and 410,000 industrialized workplaces.
Because of its strong export characters, it brings non-specialised smaller and mediterranean enterprises to the international markets and makes it to the Creators innumerable workplaces.
If France decided to exceed the nuclear power, there would be a large part of this CMU to the victim, and the six billion euros of the year to the investment and nuclear energy export would be more and more.
What electricity would avoid an EPR consisting to function for sixty years if the decline of its products is proposed?
To resolve the energy equation, you must note that there is also a little bit as a devil work, a wonderful instrument to produce electricity.
The developed by the Areva company, CO2 army solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy proved from the complementarity of energy sources.
The maximum level of safety is a absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have carried out a security authority that has been carried out without compromise and transparent controls in existing works, such as in the building in Flamanville.
The work teams who have made a name for their professionality are just to take care of the safety proposal.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has lived three severe smokes.
Only one, and although in Three Mille Island, it is entered under normal operating conditions; so he has lost no consequences for human and environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was struggled by reactor construction and infinite, human trafficking.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural catastrophes has never been achieved by these exhaustions that caused the death of more than 100,000 people.
The nuclear industry will also take their teachings from this accident as they did after the two past.
As the fruit of this procedure, as well as a cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German manufacturers and the construction of nuclear power works, the EPR provides a design that allows him to resistance against such phenomenomen.
Since the electro-technology is considered as a desirable value to build a nuclear power work, a building in Flamanville would be a favourable gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, by leaving their free grounds to lead the leading position in the increasing nuclear development.
It is unaccessible and legitimate to search for the best energy bucket for our country, but it would have been unreasonable to allow the emotions, dogs and partyman officers to inform the same economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration Last or Chance for Economic?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - transmission of police, justice and administration bodies due to one of the numbers underlined policies, agreement with this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", such as France himself was subjected.
For the short time, the office of the official side of the officer was directed by the former students, the inner Ministry had reported that France's none talents, Maurer or Kellner needed from the outerland.'
But this policy was only analysed from the economic viewpoint.
In this subject, there is an extensive consensus between the right and the left.
From the right side, the sound of Jacques Chirac, which 1976 stated that "900,000 without work, including more than 2 million immigrated work forces, couldn't be a problem for a country," from the left side by Michel Rocard, the 1990, could not take the whole poverty of the world."
The only difference is in the grade of the green gravity
The fear of the invasion of the national ground through the hordens of Poland Klempner was divided on the right and left in 2005.
During the two boards, the investors were loaded for the economic and the French society.
The only difference is in the grade of the Great Economicness, which is involving the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to banalities that indicate partnership development allows us to resolve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a problem may be affected by the choices, but it is economically costful.
As the Economic Experts of Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron forget us in a recently appeared work that is the most recent recognition of the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a larger consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of the indigenous flows on economic growth, length and workplaces in the investment changes.
Increasing income, the growth would reduce the growth and cause the situation of the work market.
The fears against the influence of the migrants are based on the view that these drivings that are inside work forces, in particular the smaller quality, replaced by exploring pressure on their lenses.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are essentially more complementary than the inside staff workers, since they have severe-minded calls in sectors that have been unloaded technically.
The small-qualified immigrants work in sectors, which lead to a small room workers, who work in dynamic sectors where education does not apply to the job.
Positive Low Effect
Even as a chirurg would have difficulties to work in a country where a manner of anesthesis is dominated, this complementarity also affects a positive effect of the inner and migrants in the fields of the internal market.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this kind and way that a percentage of the inhuman aircraft increases along with a long-term increase of real areas between 0,6% and 0.9%.
And this without a view to the fact that the variety of the ideal creation and the economic growth has been accessible by the immigrants; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based by indigenous immigrants under American Nobel Prices.
The migrants also referred to the social systems, in the European countries in the middle of a percentage of the total household.
For example, the World Working Organization assesss that a person involving the public budget in the middle of its lifetime a web contribution (including minus expenditures) in a period of 30 years after Germany.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring his mandates the missing front points with the dents.
However, these visited dentals that the immigrants should be scattered were exactly the contrary effect.
Europe has discovered the democracy, now remaining to consider the European Democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; even though it is a valuable good.
The European Continent should remind himself of who, after its foundation in Athen, had been held over the 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, the Totalarian, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Frances in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme of Greece.
Some believed that it was rich to exceed the vote right, and, directly, the way and way to view the democracy in every time on their enemies.
You know since Napoleon's little ones, that it was a character of the spirit holding.
The general choice, which represents the necessary conditions of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can also be expressed to the "Undexpression instrument" as the Republican Philosoph Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the civilians, education, declaration, economic and social community, a legal talk.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is a economic crisis, but it is also very and more political and democratic crisis.
The transaction of the Greek Truth-Falish Referendum had in this regard duplicate concluded characters: once the need of a powerful return of the policy, but on the other hand also those of the vulnerable feelings of their impossible, their unreceiveness.
This ambivalence should be considered as exceedingly.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic battle have now been broken, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, have no longer been in the right direction.
We have nothing to win in order to achieve the success of the internal referendum which has been organized in dependence of the needs and in wrong orders.
A liberty for the European single ruler or an eye linked eyes in the fields of the nationalistic refugee: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackbeil, but a collective task, with full right, declaring and standing, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no Christians in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portuguese - you know no longer where to end the record - because there is only one crisis, and this rule in Europe.
It is all Europe, which accepts the diktate of markets and the rating agencies, which makes suspicion under its unnecessary power and its solidarity manage.
It's all Europe that has been encouraged on international level.
It is concerned about the sovereignty transfers in the direction of Europe - it is the whole Europe, which is generally lost its sovereignty, and that each of its members of the nations.
The threat is to give the peoples' universality the leadership of the European project.
Because it is in general whether the Europeans can reduce the lack of their crimes, free from the markets and make a future by investments.
The exhaustion of the crisis has decided on European level, which can not be pleased without a total democratic legality, without a safe destruction.
After this proposal of Jacques Delors and the socialists had been fighted for a long time, everybody has to do the European Economic Rules today.
Consciously.
But without political integration and stronger democracy, as they proposed to the citizens, would be a renewable torture and another sack gas.
We need to take a new European design on us.
In order to lay the Republic in France, it was necessary to "build republians".
The revolution of interests alone could not be sufficient here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to make a better integrated Europe on economic level.
This can only be achieved by makeing a political democratic Europe, a real European people's society.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
The "contactless" chip cards are generally available
The World Measure for Chipcards opens on Sunday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic maintenance of their doors.
The 2011 Eurosmart should actually end up with 11% of the world-wide sales of microprocessors (EC cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion units.
The most loaded segment is the non-connected technology that allows payments in public transports or comparison of income, using the card to a reader device.
Through a year, 320 million sold in this year, 460 million non-connected chipcards should be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue (580 million expected units) and more than 10% of the global chipcard market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins on the non-country payment on the ground after the long-term time of the Asian Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already issued with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings were more significant: only 400,000 non-contact visacards were expanded.
However, consumer markets make the struggle.
Carrefour therefore emited 2,5 million without contact Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to exceed a higher speed, the banks are now necessary to carry out their customers with these cards.
"Twee large French financial institutions have been committed to depend their customers in future systematic bank cards who are occupied with non-connected chip," says Gerard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Bank test payment per phone
However, this is only the first level on the way to pay the future: the mobile phone.
A disagreement of a small percentage of the devices is extended by the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) for the implementation of these transactions.
"They're in a travel."
"But at least the next year they should find a real surface development."
"We count in 2012 with the vending of 80 to 120 million units in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are initiatived.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday to the beginning of a test traveling in Caen, which was appealed from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and cooperators should be equipped with a capsule that allows no contact payment.
The BPCE includes a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Social General had said yesterday to prepare the introduction of a offer that allows their customers a non-contact payment by phone.
Terrorists are understanding from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is involved on the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Sequence Boko Haram.
The relations of the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sequence Boko Haram appear to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vize-Au Ministry Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algier has now received "Science".
"The way and way to go with both organizations and the relations of the secret services are to a clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The reports on the implementation of two françaises in Niger have promoted a day-on-term interviews in the last January.
Antoine de Leocour and Vincent Delory, in a restaurant in Niamey of the Aqmi Aqmi, shall be held on the next day as many of their importers, for instance, one operation carried out by the French special units.
France and Nigerian admitts want to find several telephone chips in the thirsts in the use of the terrorists.
Terroristenax
The analysis of the phone calls carried out to several conversation partners who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the experts interest in the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to a nigerian who has long time in Maidguuri, a city in the north Nigeria, the town of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the sequence.
"This is a progress, however, you need to wait for a double-determining ability before you can talk about a operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's how to think."
"Man knows since years that the sequence is financial and intellectual support of Auyeen and that these are very active," the Nigerian researcher Knle Amuwo declines.
In these past months, these "aid support" have always been avoided in their history, as well as the talks and the operational methods of Boko Harem, which are now intended to attach to self-moderators and the use of steel complexer, which take the same handbook as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community to start in Washington, since this time pressed Abuja, to take the account of the problems concerned by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping in fact a long time on the Community of Illuminates, which should not be considered special attention.
Quick success
The Boko Haram founded in Maidguuri in the area of a Moschee, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Joseph, based in 2002 - what in Haussa sovily means as "the western relationship is a shade" - follows the creation of a Islamic Emirates in the North Nigeria.
In this middle region, the completion of the cohesion will be quickly successful.
She policies and reviews stretch maintenance of Sheria, while its members act in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities in the Vision.
2009, Boko Haram's activists showed particularly actively with their strengthened attacks against the Commissioner.
However, the reaction since Abuja is usually indifferent.
The army turns the city, numbers 800 dead.
The Mohammed Joseph was killed in prison.
Following this, the seat will be radically radically and will leave their Hochburgers in the north.
Last Wednesday, she was known as an attention in Jose, who requested 80 human lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram will make the crime of a self-sex-sufficiency, which occurred in the safe policy-sufficiency in Abuja, the first of its type.
In August, the local meeting of the United Nations will take place for the priority international target scheme.
The education of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania over Nigeria to Somalia, is urgent from all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have placed the Somalians of Al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé was warned by a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko Harem," to report all indications."
The world in accordance with the Republican President's Canadians
Middle Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivals in Simplification and Unknownness regarding China, Iraq, and help for Israel.
Can a crisis American make a complex world with simple to say, "It's infectious ideas?"
If you listen to the Republican President's candidates, the electorers may almost receive this impression.
Since a few days, the Middle Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their assistants will repeat their sustainable statements and their statutes on the audience policy, the traditional republican grave point.
About China, Iran and Israel's help, often undertaken in no way - Slogans.
With regard to the name of the "grond Old Party" at the top of the Middle Centre of Romney, the Chinese sent before the WTO and it is the "Manual Manipulation" subject in an American that through the exchange of all industry travels to Asia is the most exploited.
In the meantime, if this should implied the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, an elderly publisher in China under Obama and the only candidate who seemed to have an excessive vision of the exploitation policy, has nearly broken the air in respect of his emotions.
He had called to a handmaid, but constructive conversation challenges with Beijing (e.g. the current holding of Obamas).
But Huntsman is not listed because he is stealing in the depths of the opinions.
Reagan's Layer
Romney also promised military flags against Iran if the sanctions should be separated to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I'll be chosen, I'm advised to Iran's content," he said.
"We've chosen Obama again, they'll get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel to strengthen military assistance and Obama agreed to be committed to this partner against commitments.
The employer Herman Cain, the two-time-plated candidate, takes an interesting activity at its side.
He at least called to give the Chinese military defense of Contra, since Beijing's trying to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to have the fact that China was already in the possession of military atomarms!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, the Israelite support and requests military flags against Iran to be ready to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
The reaction submitted by Obama 2009 on Folterma approval against mutma-guy terrorism was also undertaken by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann's candidate.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a political growth in the U.S.
The current President's Contracts, Reagan has also obtained simple suggestions and, however, win the Kalt War.
They call in recall that Obama himself was a Amateur and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of antiterror.
They keep right on the defense of his neighborhood talks with Iran, the previous department of his "joys" from the Iraq, his unbelievableness in Lebanon, which he also entered the call of the weakness.
However, this recommendation is not very unreasonable.
The population appreciates more the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled bin lads.
Since Iraq, they are maintained by military interventions that are to be disappointed.
And Obama was surprised by argumenting that the American has to be rebuild economically to raise his leader position to a new life.
North Stream, New Port to Russian gas in Europe
The gas guide North Stream, which moves on the East Sea and links the West Europe directly to Russia, was established in operating.
It must provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gasprom was wanted to act with Glanz and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four States and Government captains, the last Sunday at the East Sea Board under the Orchester Design and at the Feinschmecker Buffet of the introduction of the new gas guided North Stream, which is located directly under the sea speed.
The German Canzler Angelika Markel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French President François Fillon and his official market route from the Netherlands, have simultaneously turned the rate of the Ventil, which promotes the Russian gas in the West European Network.
With the new gas leading 27,5 billion cubic meters for year, Russian gas will be delivered by the first road length of 1.224 km, connected to the Sant Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg Forpommers.
A second route leading a total delivery of 55 billion cubic gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption must be completed in the end of 2012.
And you have already allowed the event of the building a third direction to the same streets.
For gasprom, the right-time and point-genual fulfillment of this great build work as a wheel.
The project was strengthened in Poland and Baltic States.
The North stream Pipeline will also allow direct gas delivery to Germany, and, under the interference of each train train training through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country.
For this reason, these two countries lose a few of their powers: for them it will now be difficult to carry out the pressure to Russia by shooting the future to the East European markets.
Warschau, the most strongest in the debate, was not reached to compare the North-Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Sweet Package" in connection with the bond between Hitler and Stalin's weakness of the Occupation Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a more higher insurance safeguard by promoting this Russian project.
This is however, at the cost of a European energy, because the project has broken a breach between West and Eastern Europe.
Russia has completed it at about five years to continue its view of a direct allianship between Russia and the rich, western countries to show strong gas consumption and to continue their gas conventions to near.
"This gas leader is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new kind of kind that connects us organic and way," confirmed François Fillon in the introduction of the gas leadership, which indicates in which the large gas contracts are also important for political and economic side.
All this explains the width smoking of the multiple gasprom manager in Lubmin in respect of the gas manager.
The building of this gas leading is also an excellent technology.
The subwater leading is from a steel with beton-management to protect it before ships.
She's standing on the seaground, at about 200 m deep.
In their building, the mines fields were to be developed from the Second World War.
"Even hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, speaker of the North Stream Society.
Furthermore, increased measures were to be taken to protect Fauna and Flora.
The guidance is a long skin of metal, hard as 242 eggs, which is broken over the whole length of nothing: neither by Ventils, nor by guarding stations.
A control platform was proposed before the Sweden, but the project responsibilities had taken from it, since the Sweden had not been able to see a Russian society in permanent ways and ways on the height of their costs.
"In the case of a havaria, we'll shoot the gas cluster in less than a minute," predicted Jens Müller.
In the case of a leck, the gas in the gas direction, so, in the air.
However, this case will be considered as a less probable, since Switzerland has been estimated to a competentity of a lake for 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas drive is also ensuring by a subwater robber, which is explored to external observation weights from a sea ship, as well as from a device that circulates in the gas driver.
It has the form of a cigarette, a meter of smoking, it will be introduced into the interior of the road direction and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of continuing movement through a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides exact information on any deformations of the metal.
The gas leading was designed to work for fifty years without submitting only the minimum repair.
The gas circulation is absolutely simply ensuring by pressure.
This includes 200 bars in the future, 100 bars in the expenditure.
Five companies have joined their powers to enhance this project.
However, the guidance remains in the hand of gasprom, which holds 51% of the antivity.
In addition, the German society E. ON and BASF are participated here (in 15,5%), as well as the Netherlands gas and the French company GDF Suez (in 9%).
These five companies have developed a company called North Stream, which has been assigned to the building and the gas driver.
She has her seat in Switzerland, where the administration is specially good.
The gasprom thus reduced the entire capacity of its gas transport, and at the long-term twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom is sold for the total capacity, not as large as the real transporting gas quantities,," predicted Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas driver was safe to 30% of actioners and to 70% by bank driving.
The total job costs should be built at 7,4 billion euro for both road leaders.
For GDF Suez, the investment sum, for example, was 240 million.
However, the minority actions are convinced to reach their exhibition, since the gasprom only causes the risk of the achievement.
The gas leads to a sand, protected south street with the woodmin from the East Sea.
The 4.5 meters high Ventile figures the gas expenditure.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other gas gas cuts before it is transferred into the German gas leading.
Since the last Sunday, this terminal is delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas for a long time.
In full capacity, these 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a notebook.
From an Italian company calls to life at about 15 years ago, Moleskine wants to redirect the write new style.
There's a flair of aventeuer, at the cerebral appearance of hours with the writer.
The notebook of Moleskine is easy to recognize, with its black, right-handed inband, his glumiband, the hair-shirt sides, as highlighted by the time.
The Moleskine notebook, how you know today, has been found in 1997.
The Italian company Mode of which his seats in Milan decided to bring a separate design book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, the manufacturer of the company, is offered by the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an althered production technology, called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which is called a tree vollack, which is used for the use of poolballs.
This kind of notesbook was very asked under writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has relied a old and nearly forgotten nature that has been able to be a pre-gardist artist in the 20th century," explains Mary Sebregondi, currently market responsible in mode.
It's successful.
between 2006 and 2010, the vessels increase 26% and set up with a paragraph of 12,7 million pieces.
This is far away from the living production of the first years in which only 3000 notes were concealed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, while from France to the United States.
It is difficult to offer a fantomic image of the purchasers, since the notice book also includes business leaders as well as students and faculty.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitic, culturaler and public customers.
The small, Italian companies, which were numbered of 12 workers in his beginning, built today more than 100 employees and are available since 2008 over two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company includes its notes in books, online portals such as Fnac, in small boots of the city centres and understands to continue its identity.
"We are followed by the timegeist and his new writer, which is in place, instead of the e-mails,," said Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural charter is joined by the development of the company Moleskine: before short, the mark has launched a exposition named "Detour (Umweg) ", in the architects and artists made their own notes.
In August, the company also brought an income with Leoparden Pattern on the market in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited by his success and this cultural timegeist and understanded to diversify its products: Tasks, Terminal Calendars, Fullers, Computer Halls... The mark shows the full broadcast of articles.
A success that brings the neighbors to the plan: In Herbst 2006 Mode of the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the current Syntegra Capital, has been buyed, and has put a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment cost remaining at such high level?
At least 19% of the restricted persons are searching for a workplace.
Today starts the "15. Week of the work for the defense."
Although a most intelligenced public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment costs have been doubled as the average average value: 19% of the unemployment of the whole population.
Unbelievable?
"No, this is Eric Blanchet, Director of the Association Adapt, which is establishing the "Woken of the Work for Defenders"."
"The progresss that have been obtained within fifteen years are significant."
"Damals was not doubled, but three times so high."
"It's not really much to do."
However, it is necessary to say that for the unemployment, there are still many restrictions before they get a workplace.
Often, the elders: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They are available on a small quality level: 80% of them have no accommodation and there are only 10,000 holders between 2.3 million students with higher education conclusion.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very wide: 53% of the residents in total 38%.
Currently there are so many criteria that increase a renewed employment growth and that makes the "the course of the problem", so Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992-based agreement assistance to the companies.
So much to the fair brems.
It remains the disputing, the spirit holdings that are known, but it is easy to develop.
In April, the IMS Intreprender for the magazine La Cité, a study conducted by the manager who asked "a hard knowledge level relating to maintainer", the "represented" is "of persons in roles, psychical or intellectual minority".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 cooperators have a long way to achieve the target of 6% of companies which have been established in a law of 1987.
These recent numbers, from 2008, refer to a quota of 2,6%.
"We are now at the 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization that has been proposed to enter the contributions of enterprises that have missed this law.
The evidence: The number of "weapons payer" officers have reduced the sum of the income payments between 2007 and 2011, although 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, whose contribution increases, creates a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings a real recognition, especially in the large company groups."
According to the Ministry of Working, only 59% of the employees between 20 and 49 companies are 82% of the companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What for a happy"
Ready before they bought the "Blue Services (20:45 hours) Stirns, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had no pleasure that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too long to say that it had given a secret understanding between them, but the image says symbolic bands.
Side on the supervisor podium of the city de France would have seen George Leekens and Eden Hazard to be able to smile well and enjoy peace.
Five months after the temperable age of his attackers against Turkey, the Belgian National Trainer had nothing to do as lob about his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," ensures the famous Liller of his side.
What is the contrast between his design in the club and the National Elf "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all over what is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time to go to the beginning."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, intended freetaking against Romania in respect of the match against France, to finally arise "."
Nevertheless, note of the "comfort" notes.
The French National Assembly fires since the age of 7 years, he led his weak fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I've been supported firmly," he confirmed.
This makes it easily to strengthen the characteristics of this occurrence.
Soviel in the foreground: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be forgetted."
"We've just gone through the way."
"When they can play, it means great luck!"
Legends read his side with goodness "Stullz".
"The honour, a galamatch."
"Stolz" also - in his property as "neighbors" - confirm that France has become a manage at very high level," and it is less than one year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a good job," he said.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European majority, the technology seems to share the aircraft with the blue (the French National Elf) ... and the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We're little Belgians come out," he remarked.
"We're going to plan a thing, the players are ambitionate, they're hungry."
"They will notice that in the existing games." The game will be joined against France.
Portuguese very transparent
The Portuguese Management of Paul Bento sees with a great optimism to the refrigerator against Bosnia (22:00) this Sunday in Lisbon.
During the illustration, both men had the fact that they had.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy marriage and especially a happy country."
Paul Bento sees already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no less doubt that "La Selecçao", its national age, for which he has been designed since September 2010, will be qualified for the European Mastership 2012.
For Portugal, it means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and to keep a jealousy, and for Bosnia.
In view of the tracking (0-0) on freetage in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the crowds are not yet satisfied.
Portuguese dominated the party more than one hour clearly, but the manner was not able to express the matter the so important story that had taken the pressure of her.
"This is a good result, however, a certain risk, because we haven't obtained an extractor."
However, in their hot shooting place de la Luz in Lisbon, the portugueses are convinced that it should be a public, which must be likely to be on the game, even though the party was of course preached as "certain Button", the optimistic, but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very nice match, but we are completely convinced to win the superhand," said the 42-year Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to be in the European Government of 2012," however, related to Carlos Queiroz’s followers.
The difference on Friday in Bosnia moves Portuguese to get and win a gate.
A difference may have enough for the bosnians who also needed a gate.
"This is a good result, however, a certain risk, because we haven't obtained an extractor," says Bento.
"We're going to act against a manner that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As the Portuguese had already been proposed in Zenice to spend a maximum pressure on the bosniers to "no time to think."
A good idea, under the condition that it will be implemented this time.
