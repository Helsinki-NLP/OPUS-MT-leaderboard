AMs Wales are worried that they will ‘look silly'
Some AMs are concerned about a suggestion to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Parliament in Welsh).
This is an attempt to change the name of the assembly.
Across the political spectrum, AMs are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour AM said his group was worried because the title was "a drink with the words Twp and Pwp."
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: You don't want to be called that names.
A spokesman for the group said the group was "unhappy" with the suggestion and that they had offered other options.
A Community Leader said that his group kept an "open mind" regarding the name change, but it was suggested that there is not much difference on speech between MWP and "Muppet".
The ASC Welsh translation does not cause so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name, said: "Of course, it will be a matter for the members themselves to make the final decision on any descriptions of Assembly Members' titles."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals. It was found that there was widespread support to call the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
In terms of the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP) / Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but MWP came out strongest in the public consultation.
AMs are reportedly suggesting other options, but the prospect of coming to a consensus could endanger the Llywydd, Elin Jones. She is expected to introduce draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the scheme works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AAMs will have the final vote on what they should be called as they discuss the legislation.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic."
This popular vote was drawn in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, a neighbouring country that has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a right to its territory. She has repeatedly opposed the country's requests to become an EU and NATO member.
Gjorge Ivanov, the President of Macedonia, opposes the country vote on name change and has said he will dismiss the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO is a change of name.
St. Martin's bells are silent as churches in Harlem face difficulties.
"Historically, there was a bar and a church at every corner, according to the old people I had spoken to," Mr. Adams said.
Today, it's one of them."
He said he understands why the bars are gone.
"People socialize in a different way today", he said.
"Bars are now not considered community living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
In terms of churches, he worries that the money gained by selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it to do, "and sooner or later, they will be back in the same old position."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominia full of the kind of people who will not help the rest of the area's sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy condominia in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all these churches will close sooner because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to these condominia will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - The Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregant who had been worshipping nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's church was transferred to a black church under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the retailers on Street 125, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or hire black people.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for rebuilding, the bells were commissioned.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's church, was pleased to put the so-called "bells of the poor" on them.
The expert who sang the bells in July gave them another name: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical tool."
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noticed that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to sing the larger bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the St. Martin's church was not in place.
What has happened in St Martin's church in recent months has been a complex history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been employed by church lay leaders, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the parish comprising lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to note concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry had not been associated with the employment of the architects and contractors to whom the diocese had been sent.
Some people have complained that there is a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy as he plunges into search for lobsters in California
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old and injured him on Saturday while he was diving in search of lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy shouting for help. He then swims to him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was initially excited about catching a lobster. But, upon reaching the boy, Hammel said to him "he noticed that he was shouting, ‘I’ve been hit!
I've been stabbed!"
The bridge of his shoulder had been torn open".
I yelled everyone to get out of the water: ‘There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was picked up from the water in a helicopter and transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in a serious condition.
We don't know what type of firearm was responsible for the attack.
In a brief to the media, lifesaver Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been spotted in the area some weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles said the victim had sustained adverse injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officers blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas. This was done for 48 hours for safety and investigation purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty alternatives in the form of department stores that include specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a £2.8bn market that is still growing although fashion and household goods sales are decreasing, these larger beauty suites will be trialled in 11 stores across the country. They will be put in more stores next year if they are successful.
This investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use empty shelves after being prosecuted for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty products offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up collection so that most products are vegan-friendly - something that's more and more in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will trial concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying some food every day in local convenience stores means supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury’s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains two years ago. He says that has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous effort of the supermarket to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to share the revenues of the pharmacy shops in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s, three years ago, sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain. The business included 281 shops and was sold for £125m.
He said Lloyds would be part of the scheme as it would add an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty shelves in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues and will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us now a vital beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, was furious after television presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of accessories and goods to home.
The pair's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of the presenters of This Morning, had posted a message on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new big contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "wonderful" on Tuesday when the musician admitted at a meeting at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time for Truly, their brand of accessories and household goods.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and there was mention that it doubled Willoughby's fortune, an estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones travelled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her future in the long term and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone was surprised when they heard that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was going on, and it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, and those are ready to be sold."
Experts believe this decision by one of Britain’s most bankable stars could cost the company millions due to major product investment, including cushions, candles, clothing and household goods. This could also mean further delays in the launch.
This may also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby Truly settled with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, aged 52, as chairman in March.
The couples go on holiday together and Jones owns 40 per cent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter on ITV.
Last night, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We wouldn't comment on his business affairs."
It was a difficult course ‘and then we fell in love'
He made fun of the criticism that would be received by the news media for making "unprecedented" comment, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the leader of North Korea.
Why did the Trump administration give up so much?
Trump said by mocking a news conference.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim wanted to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump described as a major step forward for North Korea's decentralization.
However, the discussions on declamation have slowed down.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North does not believe the US is responding in line with North Korea's early decentralisation movements.
Instead, he said that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more confident in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had resulted in positive results - stopping the testing of rockets, helping to free hostages and ensuring the rest of America's troops return home.
He went on to justify his unusual approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to come into this full arena, we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Earthquake Destroys an Island, Killed by Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster was declared, something necessary to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've clarified that they don't ask for international help, so it's quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is creating a team to travel to Palu, they are not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national agency for disasters, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because the earth is constantly vibrating in Indonesia, the country is never prepared enough for nature's disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
It appears that sirens were not alerted to the tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been issued, and that that has contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia at the best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics is even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racketeering infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a load of money on roads and railways.
But a lack of money has been a burden on Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from long-lasting denominational tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have engaged in a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other unwarranted weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge from the Liverpool team, scoring an equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge stopped Liverpool from losing a Premier League match to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge had a death by Xherdan Shaqiri and was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He kicked the ball to his left before shooting towards the far post.
The ball rose high above the box as she moved towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and dropped the ball into the net.
"I was trying to get to that position and get hold of the ball and players like Shaq are always playing when that's possible, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I kicked the ball without thinking too much about it, just going for it."
Half time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star from Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea team's shooter passed the ball with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the centre of the field and sprinkling into half Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a fast ‘kick and go' bass in the middle of the field.
He then skillfully kicked the ball forward between the other team's defenders, leading Hazard to the box.
Hazard was earlier than the defender who finished in the far post net with a kick with his left foot past Alisson Becker, one of Liverpool's players.
Liverpool play against Naples in a group match in the Premier League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Total deaths following the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The total number of deaths following Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's agency for disasters said early on Sunday morning.
It was recorded that many people were stuck in the rubble of buildings that fell when the magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck on Friday, an earthquake that caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which includes more than 380,000 people, was covered with debris from demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Penbedw, Deeside, today morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to let them know if they have heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘Although the investigation has only just begun, I would ask anyone who was in the John Street area of Penbedw to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on dashboard cameras, they should contact us in case they have information that is essential to our investigation".
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the Penbedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations continue and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's nearest relative.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard it.
Residents are now being told they will have to wait a few hours before getting back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime site.
The woman came in her tears.
She still repeats ‘this is so terrible'.
At 2pm there were two policemen in the cordon and another was outside.
A number of officers stood in the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 setting out a 247 September record.
Cromwell's statue outside Parliament is the latest memorial to be part of the ‘history overhaul' fray
Removing the statue would be a poetic justice for the terrible destruction that caused so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction made by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society said that Mr. Crick's suggestion is one "true" that is "trying to revamp history".
John Goldsmith, chair of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate about the removal of statues, Oliver Cromell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for carrying out or commanding the iconoclasty of English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrait of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the historiography of a figure that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, possibly more in the 19th century than today, regard Cromwell as a figure who defended parliament from external pressures, the monarchy in his case.
I don't know if that's true or not, but it's an ongoing debate.
What is certain is that the counterattack in the mid-17th century has informed the subsequent development of our country and Cromwell is a single well-known figure representing one side of the issue.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
The Raibus Pig Kills a Farmer from China
A pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, who was known by his surname ‘Yuan', was found dead near a pig's tuck in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His artery had broken and was blood was over him.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the statement, he had travelled with his cousin from the nearby province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and noticed that a nearby pig's tuck door was open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the tulle and that there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550 pound pig had ripped the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs had been torn and they were all blood," said the cousin, who was called according to his surname, "Wu", according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
Neither Yuan nor his cousin was the animal that killed the man.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the site.
According to the statement, Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing compensation for his death.
Although not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650 pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that blood taste can cause them to behave so.
"They're believable.
They're young, very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of a Rosa hurricane cause heavy rainfall over a vast area of the southwestern US
According to forecasters, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the western coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa's hurricane will cause heavy rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern US over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Hurricane Category 1, from 5am ahead of Eastern time on Sunday. The hurricane was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the Western Coast of the US. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the hurricane will begin to push deep tropical humidity towards the north to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will then react with the approaching trough causing heavy rainfall over the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous major flooding, a flow of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as between 2 and 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the south-east, especially over much of Arizona.
Major flooding with the conditions may quickly worsen due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be very unwise to venture out into the wilderness on foot with a threat of a tropical hand.
Heavy rain could cause the streams to become wild rivers and a storm of lightning and thunder will cause strong winds and blows of dust in the area.
The approaching trough will cause some local heavy rainfall in parts of the Southern California coast.
A total of more than half an inch of rain may fall, which could cause a small flow of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the area's first rainfall during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin arriving in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rains spread more late Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperature will change dramatically throughout the U.S. during October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature through the middle of the US on Sunday.
There are nearly 20 degrees of difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern US is expected to have a warm start to October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long term climate forecasts show a high chance for temperatures higher than average for eastern US throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s, giving evidence on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters advocating routine programs to broadcast the unexpected turn received on Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake, indicated that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her inappropriately and tried to pull her clothes off at a party in high school, and he was drunk.
Kavanaugh said in giving his evidence that he was absolutely sure that did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And usually Nielsen gets some trouble measuring people watching in offices.
To give a perspective, the size of this audience resembled an audience who would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which the channel's opinion hosts has given strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, who led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was also a lot of interest in listening.
Flake was the dominant figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republicans office stated that it would vote from Kavanaugh's party, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning with protesters yelling at him as he tried to enter a lift to a Judicial Committee hearing.
He was standing looking around the floor for some minutes as he got a head full, live on television on CNN.
"I'm here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have the power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said that before the lift closed, he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filmed live hours later, when it became time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and have a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI would investigate the claims against the nominee by the following week, a result which minority Democrats have been encouraging.
Flake was partially convinced after a conversation with his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh.
British MP May accuses critics of ‘playing politics' in Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those criticising her plans to leave the European Union saying they were "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticised what she calls the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was "absolutely ridiculous" a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs.
Wayde Sims shooting case: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to prison on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the affair.
The police found the glasses on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, the CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted he shot and killed Wayde.
It has a $350,000 fund, the Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the throat.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's refugee taskforce, the state's police crime lab, the South University police and the area's citizens for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the athletic director of LSU, thanked the area's law enforcement team for its "dedication and work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot and six-inch forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team had "broken their hearts" and were "deeply alarmed" after hearing of Wayde's death.
This is the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
Burning Man in Mexico City
Sludge splashing from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the people of Mexico on Saturday not to get close to the volcano after the activity increased in the crane and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered over 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of fractures and fractures.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ashes covering the front windows of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
The Catholic Church has been in conflict with the Catholic Church for over a year since the independence of the Catholic Church.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two protesters in favour of independence clashed with the anti-terror police and as thousands joined competing demonstrations to mark a year since Catalonia's split vote on secession.
A group of people in masks who were in favour of separating the anti-terror police who held them back with eggs and powder paint, created dark clouds of dust in the streets that would usually be crowded with tourists.
During the day there were also collisions, with police using their batons to control the fighting.
Over a number of hours, groups in favour of independence shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" and unionist protesters shouted "Long life to Spain."
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to the local press.
The tensions are still high in this area that has its moment of independence, and that was a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but not many people came to vote and those opposed to segregation boycotted the vote significantly.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the vote at polling stations across the region in violent collisions.
There have been groups of independents camping on Friday night to stop protests in favour of the national police.
The opposition went ahead but was forced to follow another trail.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the separatists with his wife, he was no longer confident about gaining independence for Catalonia.
"Last year we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry with happiness in being able to vote but we're back in the same old situation now," he said.
Although they managed to win a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, groups in favour of independence have struggled to keep the momentum going this year and many of their best-known leaders have either exiled themselves or are waiting for a trial to help organise the referendum and declare independence thereafter.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone to support the police, the politicians on both sides had been stirring up the waters during the collision.
The damage is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would be applying in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the reversal in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and to the building itself.
A crossbow may have been shot at the car sometime as well.
Menga's shot secures a 1-0 victory for Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston upset the Rangers causing Steven Gerrard to miss for the second time in 18 games as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in a moment.
Gerrard's team have not won a home away game in the Premier League this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, who are at the top and eight points ahead of them.
Before that, the Rangers will host a match against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has beaten six consecutive games in the division, and the head coach, Holt, has not lost a game since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against visitors
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but dragged his effort across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort wide after sliding to meet Craig Halkett's header across the goal,
The home team were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause difficulties for the others in certain places.
And that's how the ultimate goal was achieved.
The Rangers donated a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers were managing possession of the ball but were unable to break through the home team's defenders and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't care much about sex.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from another Livingston play-off set.
Crossers were continually coming to Livingston's box and they continued to be cleared, and two penalty kicks - after Halkett challenged the deputy player, Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - were overturned.
‘Awesome Performance’ by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of BBC Scotland's analysts at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise the expectations on this ascending path.
Their style of play and personnel has not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be praised for the way he has motivated the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, arranging an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet through the game.
But the Rangers didn't have a lot of inspiration.
Although they played well at times under Gerrard's management, those standards were not seen.
They didn't have much of a hold on their last ball - they only opened the home side once - and it was a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
A warm welcome to Erdogan in Cologne
It was a blue sky and everyone was smiling on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – a visit to try to improve the relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreed over issues including human rights, freedom in the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of fans had come by the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who were against Erdogan – many of whom were Kurds – made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These hostility protests reflect the rift associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is considered an autocrat by others.
A car crash in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the site.
The accident occurred some months after another cyclist died in a ‘taro and flee' accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Road closures and diversions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers have been injured in clashes
Six officers have been injured in clashes in a high-security prison for men, according to the Jail Office.
The incident occurred in Her Majesty's Prison Long Lartin at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the chase, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one aden alone.
The minor injuries that the officers had on their faces on the site were treated.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Prisoners with specialist training staff have gone there to deal with this incident which continues in Her Majesty's Prison Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend more time in prison."
Her Majesty's Prison contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the prison governor was said to have been treated in hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October last year, anti-terror officers were called to prison to deal with serious incidents where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Great Floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dry Areas Can Benefit)
Tropical low pressure is a rare thing in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the start of next week as the rest of Hurricane Rosa travels across the Southwest of the Desert, causing a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep an eye out for major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning into rain late Monday evening.
In a message on Twitter, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm status or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ boundaries."
The latest National Center on Hurricanes models predict between 2 and 4 inches of rain, with a few rare examples of a total of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Edge.
Other areas in the South West of the Desert including the Great Basin and the central Rockies are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with some cases of a total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, Rosa rain can benefit them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rainfall will be beneficial because there are currently dry conditions in the South West.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme dryness at least, the highest category but one," said weather.com.
Rosa's path will initially lead to land along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, who was still as strong as a Sunday morning hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm reaches the colder waters of the Pacific so it weakens.
Because of this, the hurricane is expected to reach land in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California into northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and to southern Utah arriving late Tuesday night.
"The main danger to be expected from Rosa or the remnants of the hurricane is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern U.S. Desert," the National Center on Hurricanes said.
This rain is expected to cause major flooding that can endanger life as well as a flow of rubble in the desert and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Norton's Midsomer Attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and one 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital and continues to be there in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officers have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone from what happened to present that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has ‘died from hatred and anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote over Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to counter the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and was under the impression of denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually abused her decades ago, both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The President said on Saturday that "America's people have seen the greatness and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding history of public service," he told the crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as speaking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the midterm elections.
"There are five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not trying, but I'm trying," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere trying to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "resist and block."
The first key procedural vote on the floor of Parliament regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a GOP senior leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds are killed by Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom have been swept away as huge waves broke on the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves hit as high as six metres on the beach at night, sweeping much away and killing them and damaging anything along the route.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami alert was received yesterday, people carried on with their activities on the beach, they did not immediately run from there and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, at a briefing meeting in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it was dragging cars, trunks, houses, it was hitting against everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 cya (497 mph) before hitting the edge of the beach.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survive.
Around 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had fallen and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks were still shaken the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that contained 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as one "healing" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings that had fallen, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the summit of the earthquake.
"There was no way to communicate with Donggala to get information", Nugroho said.
"More than 300,00 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a disaster already, but the situation could worsen", he said.
The agency was harshly criticised on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media a man on a high ground can be heard shouting at people in the street below warning them that a tsunami is on its way.
Within minutes a wall of water hit the shore, carrying buildings and cars from there.
Reuters was unable to verify the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major electricity cut that extinguished the communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but those who have had to leave their homes really need food and other essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in Indonesia's Tsunami Scil.
She's a terrifying situation.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the workers are sheltered in tarpaulin shelters that have been placed in their office yard, they passed torpedoed views on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as support groups embark on the ruthless process of providing emergency support, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies or staff cannot be provided unless the site of the disaster has been declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened again.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government said, 'yes, this is a national disaster,' we can get international help, but there is no status yet."
As night fell in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of those still missing hoped that their loved ones would live through some miracle, which would ease some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under a rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his pupils were among the others who are stuck in the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional bag," he said.
During the hours after the paragliding community heard of the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a host of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
But there was only one grey tick next to his messages, rather than two blue ticks.
"I don't think that means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as ATM machine is refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from one of Brink's employees who was refilling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man "runs from behind the Brink worker" and steals a bag of money that was supposed to be provided.
Witnesses saw many others fleeing the site, according to the statement, but police did not identify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on who these people are should contact Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been called Ye and used the name as a title for his eighth album, which was announced in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He goes on the show in place of Ariana Grande, the American singer who withdrew due to "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', West maddens earlier this year when he discusses the title of his album with Big Boy, who presents on the radio.
"It's you, it's me, it's us.
The name went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone – reflecting the good, the bad and the confusion, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are."
There are a number of other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had various names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to collaborate with West, has also been using his name by varying it in terms of the heifer and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use troops against citizens
Mexico's future President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use troops against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody revenge against students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised "never to use the army to defeat the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot during a peaceful demonstration on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, when the student movements of the left wing were rooted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the young people of Mexico by providing subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities meant that young people were attracted to crime gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the money it spends on research in the field, said investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, although U.S. does not generally have a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year, aiming to be the best country for all innovations by 2030.
"Securing double funding for research in artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less advanced than the USA, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is achieved in the USA, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is Chief Executive of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he was working on an artificial intelligence system that beat the best Othello player in America. He later became an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge in the field of Defense, and asked when the next would be to help identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to earn grants from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently sought to employ bright alumni from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said changes to the migration policy could help the U.S. to reinforce its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Science of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way as the National Institute of Science and other government institutions provide funding to researchers from the USA, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence was being formed.
And this month DARPA announced an investment in an enterprise called AI Next.
In terms of the NSF, he is currently investing more than $100 million a year in Artificial Intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for months.
Macedonian citizens vote in referendum on a change in the country's airspace
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday as to whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonia Republic", which would resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to boycott has cast doubts about whether the number of voters will meet the 50 per cent target needed to validate the referendum.
This is the question of the referendum vote: "Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece."
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to have access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live free under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us," said Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although they are not legally bound, enough members of parliament have said that they will wait for the outcome of the vote in order to make it a definitive vote.
To change the name would have to have a majority of two-thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no mentions of any inconsistencies by 1pm.
However, only 16 percent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of voters registered voted.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would allow the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small platform and placed chairs in front of tents that were set by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join by being able to hold our head high, not through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a member of NATO will ensure the investment that Macedonia really needs, a country whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the result of "yes" would "confirm our future."
According to a poll set up last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - which is lower than the required number.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV Macedonia found that 57 per cent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, that would be the first serious blow to Western-backed government policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, passes all Brighton defenders and gets a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crashed Brighton defenders during a 2-0 Manchester City victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero to that looked awfully easy as he scored in 65th minute.
The shooter from Argentina got a base in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed one defender away before running faster than many others on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he gave a bass to his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first touchdown in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We thought we'd play 55 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton territory that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the backside to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before guiding Sterling towards the farthest post.
Chelsea's forward kicked the ball into the net before slipping over the boundaries.
Manchester City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League play-off group at 12:55pm on Tuesday at Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer for playing against the Rockies
Since the Nationals do not have the hope of competing in the second chance games, there is not much reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the mound on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in terms of second-round games for the Rockies, who take the lead on the Los Angeles Dodgers from a single game in the NL West league.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to secure their place in the first group.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can walk the rubber knowing there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in such a game?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but according to the statement they wanted to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had an exercise session on Thursday and would throw it on his normal Sunday rest day.
The right hand thrower playing for Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeout' shots in 220 2/3 batting this season.
Trump's rally in Northern Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his selection for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big ones – I'm not applying but I'm really applying, that's why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening now.
And they are determined to take back the power by using any means needed, you see the hatred, the malice.
They don't care who is hurt, who they have to tread on to have power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give that to them."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "resist and stop."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats a "flin and chasm and an unpleasant and a liar."
He referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Parliamentary Judiciary Committee, and loud buzzing was heard among the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a moment - that was an example of bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad party.
People don't want to listen to those who say they don't.
When I got my hands on some of my favorite things in life, I was pleasantly surprised.
After all, I'm the latest from many Labour MPs to hear that we're not welcome - and that's why we say it.
My co-worker, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she stood determined against anti-semitism.
In my case, the offer of a reprimand judged me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Disagree with him about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the East Nottingham Labour meeting on Friday stated "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the majority of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, it is not a tone so that is in most meetings nowadays and we have long forgotten about the promise of "more kind, more tender" politics, whether or not that was ever achieved.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour party and each view is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Co-workers I used to think were of the same political will as I was starting to expect me to make a pole turn and support views that I would never otherwise have agreed with - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning centre politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it's not just me who has experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are aimed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professional and determined nature of those colleagues who face a lot of sexist or racial abuse every day but don't let that get the better of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we're not a party so broadly now and with every proposal of "loss of confidence" or change to the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not express my opinion too much, then I would be "right."
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, angered by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which was responsible for the heartbreaking state of my comprehensive school classroom. Since then I have sought to promote better public services for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or as a minister in government.
I've never been in the same situation, nor in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political views and the areas I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party with the country moving towards a Brexit that will be a blow to households, businesses and our public services.
But, in fact, I don't have a message to Momentum Nottingham, but a message to my constituents, Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that any number of threats from my non-election or political convenience won't stop me from acting in the way I think is best for you all.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father is unbeatable at the top
Two late attempts may have deviated somewhat from the final result, but it is certain that Ayr deserved to win this Tennent Premier League game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team not beaten from the ten.
In the end, their excellent defence work, as well as their take-up of opportunities, was responsible for maintaining the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging matches so far, but nobody has beaten us, so I have to be content," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Father, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson’s 14th minute bid, which was converted by Frazier Climo, ensured that Ayr was ahead. However, the yellow card that got the Scottish cap, Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, meant Melrose was able to take advantage of that and Jason Baggot picked up an unconverted bid.
Climo ensured that Ayr was even more ahead with a penalty kick, before he, just before half time, scored and converted an individual try to secure a 17-5 score for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's bid, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a bit of delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and was carried away on a stretcher. After they resumed, Ayr gained more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Then Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the extra player pay with an unconverted pass by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson gave the ball down behind Ayr's progressive skirmishes.
Climo converted the try, as he did again almost immediately after a restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth try.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, one of Still Game's stars, hopes to move into the hospitality industry after finding out he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, as well as writing and acting in collaboration with his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series in the show's history and Kiernan is likely planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but one Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
‘The sea is not ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Marines patrol the maritime headquarters of a rigging cladding in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a blue flag like the sea.
Maritime centers from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
His recovery is a duty."
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody collision over resources in the 19th century is still alive - in the same way as the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are more pronounced than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a verdict by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and of course she is confident in waiting for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivian citizens will watch the judgment of the international court of justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hag will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim - after decades of intermittent talks - that Chile must discuss giving Bolivia an opening to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president - who faces a controversial battle for next year's by-election - relies heavily on the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia - and many would not change if the court did so.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has insisted that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the international court of justice comes only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests "that the case was not a complicated one," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean husband who specialises in international law.
And rather than improving the case of Bolivia, the last four years may have made the case worse.
"The current Bolivian administration has hampered this issue relating to accessing the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric has undermined any goodwill that Chile had left behind, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hag, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was usually a quick process.
Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "give an end to 139 years of disagreement over mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Marales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime issue as a political truce.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
It's an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not remove its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons unless the member trusts Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that he would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the idea that continuous sanctions and U.S. opposition to an end to the Korean War will only make the North surrender.
Washington avoided agreeing with the statement before Pyongyang made significant disarmament moves first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have a second summit.
But there is a lot of doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about surrendering weapons that the country probably considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of giant headgears are about to arrive at your High Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of huge and impressive headgears for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which shined on the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the extraordinary creations of these designers have been featured on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was an over-the-top luxury greyhound hat decorated with the wide edge of a feather covering the models' heads.
Among the other major accessories were water melons decorated with gems, a wizard's hat and even pineapple - but these hats wouldn't warm your head.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of strange masks - and that in good time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had lips sewn together and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to high-end fabric.
One of them was like a scuba-plumber dress with snorkels and goggles, and another looked like an ice cream cone, and that melted.
And, if you enjoy big fashion statements - here's your chance.
Those who keep track of style predict that huge bonds could reach your high street.
These large hats follow the style of ‘La Bomba', the popular straw hats with the two-foot wide edge, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these impractical hats seen on social media also had another big creation on the fashion platform - a straw bag almost as large as the model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia edge and white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see big beach hats and bags arriving in the high street next summer - as the designer has made so much impression, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for large accessories.'
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, only underpinned by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Council for Scotland (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a leading school curriculum, we still see modern languages as popular topics that are chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, that will stay in his memory.
If you talk to someone in their own language, that will stay in your heart."
This is a powerful message to remind us that we can only rely on the English language when we try to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at this year's exam results recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and include the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who studied foreign languages have received a high A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72 per cent of pupils had an A-High in Mandarin, and 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish had an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, such as subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, there is an increasing demand for languages in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more proposed job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career one chooses, if that person has learned a second language, he will have a real future advantage in having such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will immediately step forward.
According to a YouGov poll involving more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. In addition, French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of 15 per cent.
This is the reason why investing in language teaching is important to children today.
Being able to speak a number of languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages they will teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will be teaching languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages he can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff specialising in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will equip children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever is in front of them.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages are still vital to the country's future, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
It's got to be good to watch.

LeBron played his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' coach, has announced that James will play in the series' opening game before the start of the season on Sunday receiving the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he will play again.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' reporter, Mike Trudell, gave a message on Twitter saying that it is likely James will play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"In this time in my career I don't need games before the season to prepare," he said.
West Virginia Trump Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump begins a series of campaigning rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking to gain support for the mid-term elections as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the hearings this week for his nomination to Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is under stress as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to confirm him in parliament postponed for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans who face hard elections in November to win a little momentum.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that the five rallies over the next week would aim to "spread out volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and add to the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many provinces as possible as or begin the important campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a rally tonight could bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get attention from Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to boost him in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show the puck to fight on going to Sunday's individual games
After three sessions one sided, Saturday afternoon's quartet could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept imagined in the sporting world but it is a concept in which the players believe especially in competitions like this.
So, where are they going to say that's the momentum right now?
"They were ahead of six points and now it's four, so we have a little momentum for me," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plain with another eleven to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a little bit of wind in their mood and they have enough to encourage them, especially from Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
Speith has been excellent from house to house and he leads by example.
The screams of celebration went higher as his round went on, he managed with a vital pit to go on a game to four each although he and Thomas had been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the kit that won the game for them on the 15, the kind of scream that tells you that he doesn't think America is out of it again.
"You have to focus and worry about your own game," said Speith.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable Ryder Cup story.
"There's only four of them, and they can't do anything wrong."
"Moliwood" was the only bar not to have a Saturday afternoon softener, and they didn't have a Saturday morning softener, Friday afternoon or the last nine Friday morning either.
That run, and the way in which the energy flows between them and the crowd confirm that they are the players to beat on Sunday, would be the same player more popular to confirm Europe's victory as its right to lie over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both on the same pitch on different holes.
But, it's an early rookie to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson beat Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero the morning, easily when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Following a bogie and two doubles in the first nine was the Spaniard and Swede in a hole that they came not close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday there's no one to help you out of your hole.
There are four interesting pauls and quartets to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
So far Europe has played better as a team and they lead a bit at the start of last day, but the quartet session has proved that Team USA has the ability to fight, something some especially in the US doubted.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four-ball games and four Saturdays 10-6 ahead of the US.
Amazing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to go and score them so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European teammate Thomas Bjorn, who attempted to regain the trophy after his loss at Hazeltine two laps back, dominated the poor American squad in four balls the morning by going and the series to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in the fours, but they could not get rid of the offense.
Jim Furyk's squad needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookies to win four points after each other and he and Molinari, who have been called "Molliwood" after an incredible weekend, are the second bar to get four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After growing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls they worked brilliantly together to beat Woods on American rookies Bryson Dechambeau of 5 and 4.
Wood, who pulled himself two games on Saturday, has missed 19 of his 29 games in four balls and quadruples and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, unflinching for the morning ball pedestal, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the fours and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who are first and third in the world of 2 and 1.
Everything went well for Europe on a nice and windy day in the south west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They made a win of 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later they yuro Polter and Rory McIlroy of 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
A team has only come back two times in the history of the Ryder Cup from being four points behind at the start of the individual games, although the Furyk squad only needs an equal score as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming back on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their ability.
North Korea says it will not be unarmed without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the U.N.'s continued sanctions strengthened mistrust in the U.S. and that the country will not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill steps" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear exercises and missiles, decommissioning the site of nuclear experiments, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But we do not see such a response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri had repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's resistance of a gradual response to de-nuclearization where his North Korea will be rewarded in taking rank-and-file steps, his statement was to see significant as it did not reject unilateral de-nuclearization altogether as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trum at the first conference between the current U.S. president and the North Korean archbishop in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trum pledged to guarantee Korean security.
North Korea has been trying to have a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. requires having "de-nullification first" and they are increasing the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a compelling manner, and they are even opposed to the "declaration to end the war," RI said.
"The creation that sanctions can conquer us is a dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that persistent sanctions strengthen our misconceptions."
Ri did not mention plans for a second conference between Kim and Trump, a conference the president had mentioned at the United Nations a week earlier.
The minister noted instead the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five years and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of de-nuclearisation and not the US, de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not result in such an impossible situation."
Despite this, Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the US with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Bad" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a self-described mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to de-emphasize, but said there was a lot of work to do again and that the sanctions had to wait until North Korea was De-nuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a set period for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the actions that have been taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: "Security Council sanctions must be enforced strictly and unfavourably until we realise and ratify finished de-nuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in order to try to limit the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Ri met with Pompeo on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last tour didn't go as well.
Pyongyang left in July saying that there had been progress, but North Korea accused him within hours of making "commandments like a gangster."
North Korea has promised to meet with Moon this month in order to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear site if the U.S. takes "matching steps."
Kim told him that the "Match actions" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and moves towards normalizing the relationship with the US.
Harvard students are given a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting its undergraduates to sleep more in order to try to tackle the macho culture of studying all night using caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's best university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of digs after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who has designed the course, a course he believes is the first of its kind in the USA.
He was inspired at the start of the course after giving a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture a woman came to me and said: ‘Why is it only now that I get to know this, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep - it was a surprise to me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being introduced for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
‘We are aware that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to be told - just as you have a right to be told what the impact of smoking is on your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse,
Ensuring you get enough quality, sleep should be a way for students to tackle stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting pressure on, because lack of sleep makes the brain believe you're hungry, making you hungry all the time
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having studied one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and was inspired to try to get the course for the whole campus.
It is hoped that the next step will require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, as well as waking up, and be aware of the harmful ‘blue light' effects that are released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your circadian rhythm resulting in sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal by Menga beats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor away game as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's non-conference team at Livingstone.
Ibrox's team were looking for their first win on the road since they beat St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for only the second time in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind senior leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and Rangers' team were short of inspiration and no sight of being able to equalise.
While Rangers now fell to sixth position, Livingstone rose to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the lumberman Calum Spence had to be treated to injury to his head after something was thrown from the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr to reach the Betfred Cup preliminary games.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 who beat Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his organized squad defeated their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the ball when she had them.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder failed his chance by hitting the ball clear.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back posts.
Rangers dominated but there was more hope than believed in their play in the last stage of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have had a kick from the spot after a quarter hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Rangers got two shots for the target in the first half but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly found no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes had been against the run of the play, no one can argue that they didn't deserve it just for their hard work.
Yet, Rangers failed and Jacobs' deep play plans and deals failed.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was unimpressed as he passed it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was like a brake as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and almost the change had an effect immediately as the winger passed to Morelos but Kelly rushed from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's squad could have added to their score in the last minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow missed a header from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another try for a kick from the spot after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson ignored the try once again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger Meter
And now page of our Almanac "Bore Sul": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in FRANCE... the day on which the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
An important part of science since then, Meter Geiger has also become an important part of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "Is that in the world?
Rogers: "Messor Geiger, it is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms released by the radiation in the minerals."
"Well, it makes a lot of noise!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.
Breeding new cancer can teach the immune system to ‘weld' foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘weld' foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells as part of treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and modifying them in a laboratory
Then they will be able to ‘see' a protein that is common in several cancers and they will be re-injected
Testing of the vaccine shows hopeful results in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells, saw your ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the cell, and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can ‘see' a protein called HER2 that is common in several cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel/respiratory cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and their ‘learning' how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a speech in support of Trump by wearing a MAGA cap.
She wasn't good
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third by that night, Ghost Town, wearing the Make America Great Again cop, he rowed against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I'll talk to a white person and they'll say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?
"If I had been worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee regarding accusations of sexual violence committed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite not being broadcast, a video of West roaring was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock attempted to mock West by posting him.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage about what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me behind the wheel.
They said, ‘paid and go out with the cap then on.'
They've pissed me off!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, then according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that he would "put my superman clog on, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments were booed at least twice by an SNL audience and the cast members were annoyed to see, Variety reported, with the same person telling the publication: "The studio went all quiet."
West had been added as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, as her ex-girlfriend rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West caused confusion to many by performing the by I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR OVER THE HAID."
But presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was only "being himself and that's excellent."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who in my opinion embraces and declares ideas that are harmful to my community.
It's free.
And we are too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper, Snoop Dogg, has been given the name Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbed to death in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an east Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington killed on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed on the stereotype of a macho hero, saying such roles on screen mean that young boys feel they have to be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed ‘something went wrong’ and questioned how to tackle a toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who married his fellow actress on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also at 31, recently admits he feels strongly about tackling the problem.
‘I feel strong at the moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?, she said.
‘What have we been teaching men as they grew, in terms of the problem we now have?'
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very male characters.
He went on to say: ‘What is instinctual and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel that they have to be a special kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he admitted that he would not make any other Game of Thrones programs when the series ends next summer, saying that he had ‘gained enough on battles and horses'.
From November Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard which is a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come to terms with Game of Thrones.
‘I met a woman on the programme, so in a way my family gave me, and my life from now on,' she said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover who is Kit's character, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate land of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the cases were passed through sex, noting a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people holding HIV like this has been reduced by almost nothing, China health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and Aids has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HICV through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Sexuality was decriminalised in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions from the infections are due to inadequate sex safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has released the Republican senators' data, killing on ‘dangerous facts' and ‘conspiracy theories'
On Saturday Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of his staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles demanded that the allegations be spread by "extremely right wing" bystanders.
"Crimes, lies, and more lies," Walters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information spread online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Judicial websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address indicating the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and they released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is wrong and a naked lie," Waters then said.
"The member of my staff - whose identities, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and inaccurate allegations - were not in any way responsible for the release of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is wrong and a naked lie."
Waters' statement criticized the online speed, including by former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that it does not have the nature to be a Member of Congress.
If a person is charged with something they have not done, they will not be angry.
They can't be disrespectful.
They cannot question the offender's motive.
They need to be quiet and calm."
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of apparently angry rogues during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had informed "the appropriate authorities and the law enforcement agency of the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure the offenders are exposed," he said, "and that they are accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - a weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British orientation and is to see fit for this revival of the Johnny English comedy parody series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to tell the difference between the two in terms of how much we're going to be able to do in the future, and how much we're going to be able to do in the future?
In any case, the non-glem Johnny English has been licensed to destroy everything back for the second time - with his name above all showing that he is a comic character created for cinematographers in non-English speaking countries.
Of course this is the silly spy who despite his noble claims includes a few Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally based on the traveller and the mysterious man Atkinson played him in a Barclaycard advertisement, leaving destruction behind.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English film.
I was delighted to see Johnny English going towards a helicopter wearing armor and the rotor blades hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's flair with physical comedy is evident, but the humour is weak and strangely unnecessary, especially now that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humour feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's silly misfortunes aren't as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's prose.
The big idea is that there's a big gap in the market.
A cyber hacker has entered Britain's secret network of spies, unleashed the identity of all the spies Britain has in the field, despite the distress of the on-duty spy - an unfortunate and small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step for a self-centered, self-centered prime minister, who is already suffering from huge political unpopularity. Emma Thompson does her best with the character Teresa Mayian but there is little in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all spies have been compromised and that it will be some for her to come and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster at some great institution, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English hires a school spy similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is tortured.
So the Batman and Robin are from getting things wrong back on Her Majesty's service, encountering Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful fatale femme Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being captivated by a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can deal with British computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous journey: dressed as attendants, they set a large French restaurant on fire; create trouble when trying to go on a luxury ship Volta; and English causes complete chaos when trying to use a Virtual Machine to familiarise themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
They make a very show of it in the final scene, but despite being so fun and uncontrollable, there's a bit of a feeling of children's TV about the whole thing.
Very nicely.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes fair play with his talents?
A Labour party denies it is preparing a scheme for the British people to work for four days a week but being paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see the British people working a week of four days - but being paid for five.
The party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that employees get a three-day weekend - but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of the workers.
Change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A high-profile Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but a four-day week is an ambition that aligns with the party's attitude towards workers' economic restructuring as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, all of the work is not done by the team.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not considered by the party.'
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to broaden his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘priorities' of the public resources companies.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders of water companies will not be refunded as a Labour government could make ‘decisions' on the basis of apparent wrongdoing.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to put 10 per cent of companies' equity; the private sector at the hands of the workers, which would receive annual instalments of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into claims against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked ‘Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was to see more openness than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this happened, after the charges came out, I said, ‘Do you do this?'
It was clear, clear and unambiguous."
However, Graham's plea to see is strong.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a horrible conviction," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett completely denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one she names can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizenship Festival, an annual musical event with an impressive list of stars taking part and an equally impressive message: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the festival's main intention of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Scheme, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else valuable to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizenship Festival been with only 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade people to demand change or just in another case of "clicktivism" - people feel they are making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Festival says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to publish commitments and policies amounting to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from their actions, with at least $10 billion of it having been classed u or raised.
The group estimates that the funding so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and activist partnership committed to "helping children reach their full potential," pledging to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 47,00 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, contributors, state governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social unfairness and malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman missionary The Power of Nutrition told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after over 5,000 actions were made calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website was asking "what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?
The World Citizenship Festival replied: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "secure" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington "if necessary" can use the Navy to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's intervention in Syria - in particular, where it is acting on the legitimate government's invitation - was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal in energy like mean they do in Eastern Europe, and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to address this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to put a siege, to make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke greeted the audience at an event being hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the USA.
He compared Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and replace fuel," he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent and fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump government tries to increase exports of its liquidated natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest downside option for consumers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline's "inappropriate" plan, which according to Trump makes Berlin a "catch" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is just an economic project worth $11 Billion and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's sharp opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure and that the users should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has generated a sharp response from Germany, who have confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "Thinking Hard" Applying for the Presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "think hard" to apply for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will be looking hard to apply for the presidency."
Warren gave her opinion about Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned in my bones about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before voting."
But a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electorate do not believe she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said the senator should not stand by the poll of the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported such an attempt.
The poll showed much more support for an attempt by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible attempt and 48 percent against.
The other Democratic names that have been mentioned as possible candidates in 2020 include former Deputy President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said it will officially decide by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son suffers, what he suffers from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds that some of our soldiers are returning with," he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other former soldiers, "they're coming back differently, they're coming back harder and they're coming back asking if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all other members of the armed forces have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault of domestic violence on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and having a weapon in his possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new US policy that is denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and DC presented a friend-to-be brief on Friday in Washington supporting a refugee seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name is in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was presented by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, without being disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who were gang members," had been treated unfairly but U.S. officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state's attorneys supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce many asylum seekers in the U.S., described as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The U.S.'s new refugee policy reverses a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants to apply for asylum if they fled domestic violence.
The State Attorney of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "offers decades of provincial, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that any request for asylum be ruled out on the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition goes against that principle," the friend-of-the-well brief said.
The attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy of denying access to migrants harmed the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to "provide necessary labor."
State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges do not provide shelter for victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"A refuge is available to individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nation, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
A refuge wasn't meant to mitigate all the problems - even the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Injured rescue efforts at Palu as the deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly critical.
"It feels very worrying," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her sick son at a migration center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come and bodies in.
The water is clean."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through their wet properties, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were crowded
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where they were treated outdoors due to strong post-vibration.
Tears came into his eyes as he spoke of feeling the earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was rushed to the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of bullying with ‘propaganda warnings'
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page advertisement in a daily newspaper in the U.S. promoting the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday US President Donald Trump referred to the appendix of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US congress elections on November 6, accusations that China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's conviction that Beijing was trying to intervene in U.S. elections is a new step in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to impose trade-promoting notifications, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an increasing trade war that has led to the two countries imposing customs duties on each other's imports.
China's early trade war tolls were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, experts from the US and China said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China will now confirm that bullying by running propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by placing a notice that they have paid for in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper stand down this street in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find unconventional voices that you wouldn't see very reflective of the diverse ideas that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic path, because the press is under the thumb of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's foremost newspapers has rejected the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn that Republicans Exclude Women Who Voted Before the Mid-Term Elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
As a number of progressive Republicans backed the nomination to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the memo of several allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on the record already say they want to go ahead with the vote.
You can't pull these things back," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of The Hill told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's (G-Arizona) last minute effort to obtain an investigation by the FBI would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters were shouting "November is a man coming!" as they protested in the Senate yard as the Republicans ruling ‘the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Doctor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to be huge," Stu Rothenburg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're enthusiastic already; that's true.
But it could increase, especially among insecure women on the outskirts of the towns and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who although they don't like the president often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her accusations of sexual violence against the nominee to the Supreme Court, analyses suggested that there would be a strong response if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed to be a complete mess for the Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the vote of the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and the way they have handled it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who to co-operate with following the Ford and Kavanaugh evidences, with a little more alongside Kavanaugh.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are sure or are against believing Ford's evidence, while 35% say they are sure or similarly believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believed certain or probable Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the Flake campaign, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford together with at least one other convict, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford gave evidence on an oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her while she was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, exposed her sexual organs to her while they were at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor is Trying to Start a New Internet in order to Get Rid of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technology pioneer project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid lets users choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt company's intention was to "control the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists to make, calendar, music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and i with at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data storage is that it's up to the user completely who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to Company Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
The Reverend Bernard Vanny won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But, he was killed by a secret shooter four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons in a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the sport that won the award to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 the Vice-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and attacks by field guns and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and with the "greatest courage" he led the line forward before rushing to a field gun on his own and landing three of the crew.
Vann was killed by a German shooter on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never compare to but that subjugates someone."
He and his brother Doctor James Vann laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the march" adding "that real hero courage is shown by the support that is given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig in its place.
Imagine this, you've stayed on your feet all night to watch Bellator 206 just to be banned from watching the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 matches, including a duck on the main card and was shown live through the UK goal on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to face each other, viewers in the UK were left astounded as the screen switched to Peppa Pig.
Some of them were surprised to find that they had to stay up all night to watch the match.
One fan on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as "some kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations said the content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so it had to be changed to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications to Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will work on their schedule so that it includes viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about the re-appearance, we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to deal with this until it's Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
I tell you, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought there was a technical problem.
But that was not the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five matches instead of six - as usual - we tried to give the fans too much and it was a long ride.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘depressed' because of his sexuality
Plumber Tom Daley says he has grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone is not like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights in order to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympic games.
The usual host of the long-established program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of break due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up "since she was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal-winning plumber has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he expressed his views because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without implications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has been unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When someone goes through so much adolescence" he went to his first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had lived through similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more things than winning Olympic gold medals.
"My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him ‘you're not going to be around to be in the good front row'," he said.
"I took hold of his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing that I realised he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first can - Heather Small's Proud - which he had resonated with before the Olympic games and still gave him a breeze.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to improve his standard to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the head and fours games.
Rather than being at the center of the activity, as it has been so often for the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being a fan and working on his game in the hope of improving the problems he has.
As the straightest of drivers was not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a good choice for a tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes rogue shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth game in the face of right-handed British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles game, had a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely vital.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, though he could do nothing else.
"He understood the role he had today, he knocked my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but like then she's worked out and like then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of the Ryder Cup career that has never reached the top of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfbacks, although Furyk says his presence is an unbeaten boost for the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, witty, it likes to make fun of people, it's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players are having fun making fun of him too, this week, which was nice to see.
It's a lot more than just knowledge."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games at the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danes had their first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage was down to thicker with Europe winning from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
Remind yourself that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won but only narrowly missed," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You have to do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and that's where we will focus.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what stands out from the other side - the best players in the world."
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be grand for this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, you're pretty much tested as a golfer.
That's the message that needs to be given to the players, which is to do your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want their players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been at both ends in the major victories on the last day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Ways at Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gave his players a boost before the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get started quickly as you've seen in Brookline, as you've seen in Medinah.
When the momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We set our line so and put the men out as we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of players in this order because I think they'll work well all the way," Bjorn said of his selection for the individual games.
The German warship has been deferred once again.
Germany's new navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war era, but it will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper referring to a spokesman on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
They will reportedly include powerful cannons, rows of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles along with some mystery technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and smaller sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the new frigates should be able to be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continued delays mean that the pioneering warships - which will allow ‘Germany to throw its power over the sea - after the era by which they will begin to serve, said Die Zeit.
F125 was in the headlines last year, after the German Navy refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to shipbuilders after it was delivered.
The reasons behind the ship's return were not clear, but German media referred to a number of essential "software and hardware flaws" which meant that the warship was good for nothing if she had to fight.
Software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
Also, it became apparent that the ship over her weight was rough which worsened her performance and reduced the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" which is 7,000 tons is thought to be twice heavier than similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the price for the whole project - including the training of the crew - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn initially.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming ever more important given recent warnings that the power of the German navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of combatable ships."
The official said the problem had deteriorated over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships having been provided in their place.
He stressed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the hidden lives of bats
New research is being carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands which aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique mammals and will help with conservation activities in the future.
The study by the scientists of the Scottish National Trust will follow the least common bat on the smallest soprano bat along with long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the site to keep an eye on the bat's activity throughout the season.
Volunteers and NHS staff will also be conducting mobile surveys using hand detectors.
A specialist audio analysis of the recordings will find the frequency of the bat calls and what species does what.
Then a report and a habitat map will be produced to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show what habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by all species.
The information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how to manage forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their hulls and leads to habitat loss.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be dangerous, along with insect catching paper and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
A owl is not blind.
But because they hunt at night their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to see insects and insects in front of them.
The National Trust of Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and are deeply concerned about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, field visits and from time to time savings.
The organisation has established Scotland's first bat reserve at the Threave stop in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the stop David Thompson said that the landscape of the stop was perfect for them.
Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other sites will help us understand more about what it takes for a man to thrive."
It emphasises the search for bats before carrying out any maintenance work in buildings as the destruction of one maternal clot could kill up to 400 female and young bats, possibly killing all the local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, disrupt or destroy their hulls.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has been urging the public to give a helping hand.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses charges of violence as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the charges of violence against him "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus have been charged with the rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, it is claimed that he had paid $375,000 to her to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news" said his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, at the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," added the player by smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable expression of doubts in a private matter," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "a moral violation of an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious crimes in terms of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are alleged to return to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to the papers presented with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 per cent" a "good man" who was disappointed by the "one per cent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and that photos were taken of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court arrangement because she was "deeply afraid" and worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK would regret the loss of carmakers forever
The UK would "sorry forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car production, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
She added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would cease production of temporary cars at its Burnaston factory near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clarke.
The Japanese car maker said delays on the border could lead to job losses in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and nearly 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion if Britain fell out of the EU at the end of March construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car makers have raised concerns about the impact a no-deal exit will have on trading across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what the car manufacturers say are risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "only on time" basis, with pieces reaching every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars built on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be border issues, problems the industry says would lead to delays and a lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so construction would have to be stopped.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU "has been carefully drawn up to avoid those border checks."
We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery chains that have been very successful."
Toyota could not say for how long the work of production would end, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and that it would eventually lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union assemblyman at the factory, said his members were increasingly concerned: "From my experience to once these jobs have gone they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with state deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight for the nomination for supreme court's Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and blocking possible justice from the president.
Trump's dismissal of the state's deputy attorney general, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has been on Washington's agenda for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, as he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "be better off not" dismissing Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate judiciary committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexually misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Here he said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "No date has been set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being delayed for another week because of all the other things happening in the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to give the press the latest information."
Some reporters would doubt that claim: Sanders has not held a brief to the press in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not an inconvenience to television journalists, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are overjoyed."
He then suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Question and Answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting any evidence: "We have looked at those numbers."
Sanders said briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the US president, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks. This will take place instead of holding a press brief where you can speak to the president of the US."
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting press.
Individual conventions for the press are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, while making an unforgettable and odd appearance at times in front of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in the Scottish NHS following concerns about Brexit
The health secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country and wish them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working for the devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been intensifying preparations for the possibility of a ‘no deal' situation.
I know this is going to be a tough time for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Abercrombie's Christion gets an emergency surgery after his head injury
The Abercrombie Christion linebacker who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers has had an emergency turnover after suffering a head injury as the team lost against the Vanderbilt Comodors from 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Rees told reporters that the injury had occurred toll before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and sort of felled there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel brought oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing it on a stretcher and escorting him back for further assessment.
A Tennessee State Police officer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operation at Vanderbilt's medical center.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury is yet" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after he was transferred from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before he had to leave the game, bringing the total tackles of the season to 18.
Buyers from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under new schemes from the Tories.
This proposal will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be applied to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year - to support the homeless.
Theresa May will announce that buyers from abroad are having to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to deliver more affordable homes and target large-paid earners.
The stamp tax increase will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will boost the Government’s intention to tackle rough sleepers.
The overpayment - which is additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let homes - can be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this offer to rise to £120 million a year.
13 per cent of brand new properties in London are thought to be bought by residents from outside the UK, and this increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to step onto the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "desolate towns" because so many buyers from abroad spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to stop quotas on affordable housing to fix the "houseware" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending the "unmanageable" turnover of people from their homes.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my work as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would improve for all new generations.
And that means fixing our lackluster housing market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create life here."
However, it can't be right that buying houses is just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, as it is for hard-working British residents.
For many too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from within reach, and the shame of sleeping out on the street remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the manager of the Scotland team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is eager for the challenge of resurrecting the North West club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a gap B and that's it," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland's programme.
"When I was a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden quite a bit with my dad, and it's something that has always attracted me back.
I'm only going to have that opportunity if I'm successful in managing a club."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland rulers are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of losing such a strong name at such a large club, having rejected previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"A success for me right now will be to see ‘can I lead this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Premier League without doubt or if not," he said.
"It won't be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years since embarking on his managerial career, having a period as a sub-manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period as one of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped lift Alloa after they fell to the third tier, and St Mirren's transformation from them fell to be at the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a crucial point," he said recalling taking the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds odd because I did it right, I made a reasonable living from it, and I got a few highlights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in terms of stress and work pressure but management feels fine.
I always wanted to be a manager and as I've realised that, I'm now more satisfied with my world than ever."

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot weather in the summer has boosted the winnings of struggling British pubs, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bar and pub groups saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but saw a 4.8 per cent drop in restaurant earnings, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from EWC business consultancy who collected the figures, said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England has remained in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern similar to that of June in July, where pubs saw an increase of 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants suffered even more.
After the decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks performed best and saw more progress than eating houses saw from a loss.
Inns focused on selling food because of the sun also suffered, although not as much as people running restaurants.
It seems that going out for a drink only people wanted to do it.
Across the pubs and bars under management, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in sales of drinks for the month, while there was a three per cent drop in food."
Paul Newman from RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis firm said: "These results show a continuity in the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain key factors in sales in the market outside of the home.
It's no surprise that eating-house groups are still suffering, although a 4.8 per cent year-on-year reduction will certainly be painful as well as on-going cost pressures.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for people running food-focused restaurants, and a time that shows whether a more moderate temperature in August will provide some really needed respite."
In July, sales at pubs and restaurants increased by 2.7 per cent, including new ones opened. This reflected the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
Sales monitor The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 action groups. They have a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and are the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed that there was an increase in "False Insta" pages.
The news has intensified the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted
Twenty per cent of pupils said they had a "major" count to show to parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils has shown a rapid increase in "Fake Insta" accounts - which refers to an Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has intensified the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they had a "main" account suitable to show to parents, while they also had private ones.
One mother came across the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a teenager encouraging others to "hit me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of Head Teachers, has found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board.
At the governing body's annual general meeting, Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be on the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has had at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from having it on the table," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to be a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American won the 200 and 400 metres race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of the other four Olympic gold medals he holds, and is now a regular byndit on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a bout of temporary ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will show if I get better or to what extent I will get better.
It's been a killing but I've completely improved, learned how to walk again and today I'm doing agile exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!"
There is a variety of opinions online regarding almost a pump advertisement that compares mothers with cows.
The diversity of online opinion is a result of an advertisement by an almost pump company that compares mothers who feed with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is known as the "first almost-silent pump in the world that can be first worn," technical commodity company Elvie has released a cellular ad in the form of a music video to show the freedom the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
There are four real mothers dancing in a grass and cattle barn, to a track containing words such as: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "Unless you noticed, these are not purses, but breasts."
The kitten goes on: "Pumping out, pumping out, I'm feeding the babies, pumping out, pumping out, I'm milking the bubby."
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been a hot topic online.
With 77,000 people having seen the video and hundreds having commented, it has received a mixed response among viewers, with some saying it doesn't really convey the "vulnerability" of the dairy industry.
"A very poor decision when using cattle to advertise this product."
Like us they need to conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie's almost pump fits nicely and out of sight inside a nursing fra (Elvie/Mam)
Another said: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump almost to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "An apologist who doesn't understand the world we live in."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as "extremely offensive."
"This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I was still feeding from the breast.
It made me feel like a puppy.
The ad was a bit hurtful but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product," wrote one
Another said: "This is a fun ad aimed at mums who are pumping (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like "bathing."
It's not enough to praise or criticize the milk industry that the advertisement is."
At the end of the video the group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump from the breast feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits nicely inside a nursing home. This gives women the freedom to move, grab their babies, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother, said: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
In demonstrating similarities between breast milking and dairy cattle we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, demonstrating the unbelievable freedom that comes from the new pump in an entertaining and relevant way.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been to the top of the list.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on stage to planner Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been evacuated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children kept from fleeing has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month has not changed much. This is partly because strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most patrons have been migrants themselves without a right to be in the country, and they have worried about risking their right to remain in the country when stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adults in the house would have to give fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior executive of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors without a company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are patrons or members of the same household as patrons, live in the country illegally, many of whom are foreign criminals.
So we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously normal, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear through a video-conferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status in front of an immigration judge.
Those who are unfit to receive help will be sent out of the country without delay.
Asylum workers and reports have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in custody the more likely it is for them to feel anxious or depressed. This can lead to violent spawning or trying to escape.
Advocates say that such concerns are worse in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where there are signs that a child is suffering may be overlooked, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the tent city without giving them sufficient time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could worsen the trauma many are struggling with.
Syria told ‘occupied provinces' of the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces on Syria's land were illegal, exaggerating the fight against terrorism, and will "deal with them appropriately."
"They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions rooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have had to clean up all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops trooping the country that has been destroyed by war.
When discussing refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed "some of the western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that urged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process for them to return," he said.
"They've made an entirely philanthropic issue a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the important last stronghold of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to take forward political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "definite time limits" and expressed hope that military action targeting jihadists would include fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who will "get their revenge."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opponents to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to get involved in the committee, saying that the work of the panel will be to "review the current articles of the constitution," and warned them from intervening.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
From accepting that, Mr. Trump could be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many of the liberals hope for him to be, that high-profile and scandal will soon end his presidency.
And that would be, without a doubt, the "most dramatic ending to presidentialism ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the guards are tired.
Since 2014, peak hours figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million peak hours, which has increased from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has surpassed the cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, program runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," mentioning a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the capital's destruction attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a trip in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment in the middle of the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, which can bring immigration families back together, and the state of the global economy.
Only the most privileged viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes further than being an informed citizen when you realize that you are on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts arguing about Bob Woodward's use of the words "intense background" as he traces information for his book "Fear," a $15,000 short skin jacket of ostriches Paul Manafort ("a man with too much pride," according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Trump's terrifying descriptions in Stormy.
I wouldn't be able to watch Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes you feel like it's a reality program is that it feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the characters of Trump's program being rotated and the daily turn in the tail end of the stories (fighting with the N.F.L, praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on Kauai's northern beach, but he had been nestled inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Parliament's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programmes a long time ago and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth is they're right."

Money from outside flows to the mid-term election races in the House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district received a stream of funds, thanks to the reshaping of congressional districts which means that there are two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recently re-formed Pittsburg suburban region is in favour of Democratic-Republican Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another region in a spring special election last year.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps somewhat with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-designated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unfairly unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance battle between the finance branches of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania having a close victory in a contest that gained much attention in March in a special election to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits say the Democrats are ahead.
U.D. is considering El Salvador's punishment for giving support to China, then withdrawing
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Panama until partners turned out the Trump Foundation management team.
State Department officials decided to call back diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to refuse to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in aid from America in 2017, was subject to sanctions, which included drug control, economic assistance and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to targeted financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country in Central America and its high rate of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting held last year which was considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials explained that they wanted the conference to go ahead, thus ending any consideration to punish El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was earmarked to address the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting.
And the three American messengers returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no difficult new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson from the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to give details of the issue described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal discussions on condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration he also spoke on condition that he was of unknown origin.
Study History
The next major event may be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump had suppressed justice, where there is now significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly in his report discussing whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability to that body, preparing to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in the long and late days.
There's a lot of uncertainty about that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable- than his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that need to be made by all of us on either side of the Atlantic that will have an impact throughout the efforts.
In 1938 German officials were prepared to conduct a coup d'état against Hitler, if the west had only resisted it and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We missed the opportunity and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of aggression that had taken place.
The course of history revolves around such convergent points, and the ruthless journey of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these inflection points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Secretary of State Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages the fortunes of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper reported last year, that he had secretly suggested recording the president and hypothesized that he was unfit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if the inquiry the F.B.I has just asked Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite allegations of credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
Are we going to vote in the mid-term elections in favour of a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be difficult on democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that at one time occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabath candles on the table depicting the swastica.
As part of my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is confident before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians, following the draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will mean they are in a good position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
His knee injury meant Graham Dorrans was unable to play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something and we came from there with a point.
We could have beaten in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As of Thursday night, it's another big European night.
We hope we can have three points but that will be difficult because they had a good result in their final game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made at the club itself, but there is a nice feeling in the place now.
The boys are very good and the boys are very good; the exercises are good.
I hope we can keep going now, forgetting the last season and succeeding."
Women are losing sleep due to this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of how they wanted to be looked after, only a few people spoke about it to family members.
About half of the individuals in a Nationwide study said they spoke to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about that.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to get that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business Nationwide.
Here's where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't report your wishes well in advance.
Work with your adviser and family to discuss where and how to take care, as those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial adviser: Your adviser can help you think of a way to pay those costs as well.
Your long-term care funding options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-money insurance policy to cover those costs or self-ensure your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Build your legal documents: Prevent legal battles.
Make sure you have a healthcare proxy so that you appoint an individual you trust to oversee your medical care to make sure that professionals are complying with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
You would choose a person you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are able to.
Don't forget the minor details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you're ready.
It's about more than financial issues, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?

Man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walks home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place at about 02.30 BST, as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to officials, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With ties broken, rescue officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala prefecture, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have had to migrate after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population estimate of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a prefecture that extends along more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The precinct, an administrative area under statehood, had a population estimate of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main supporters of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Clothing for nickel is also important in the province, but most of that work takes place in Morowri, on the coast of the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Seismic Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of Mentawai's islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The death toll of Pidie Jaya's regime in Aceh struck, causing devastation and terror as people were reminded of the devastation of the earthquake and the dangerous tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings falling.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings leaving thousands of tourists temporarily stuck there.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, hampering the reporting of domestic violence and the refusal of the arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, she took her phone off.
Palin is kept in custody at Mat-Su Preventive Facility and is being held on an unprotected $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "innocent, definitely" when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A misconduct, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with Class B misconduct, which has a day-to-day penalty in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of disrupting the reporting of the crime of domestic violence, and of possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His love for her gave him a slap in the face.
Sarah Pilan was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behaviour to PTSD resulting from his time serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have broken down and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media showing the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck on the shore.
Federal prosecutors call for the death penalty for the man suspected of carrying out the terror attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect for the horrific attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path along the Western Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov had "intended" the killing of the eight individuals and had caused "intended" serious physical injuries, according to the warning of an intention to seek the death penalty, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
Those two courts are able to give the death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Saipov with a 22-year-old charge of conspiracy to commit murder, charges usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction to motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said the attack required "significant planning and planning", describing Saipov's attack as "future, cruel and corrupt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the warning said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York introduced the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was immediately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were put to death in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who hails from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to conduct the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the detective.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag in his room in the hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the offence which includes 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defenders representing Saipov, said they were "almost disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than receive a guilty plea for life in prison without a possibility of release only extends the trauma of these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘act on the voice of the people' today during a protest at the Tory convention.
Former UKIP leader said politicians must ‘feel the pressure' from Eurosceptic members - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for discussions with the EU.
At the Birmingham parade, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the backbenches, said the UK would now ‘go out' if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in recapturing her extremely divided ranks based on Tories who are in favour of Remain is joining another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers plan in the midst of attacks by people who are in favour of Brexit, people who are in favour of Remain and the European Union.
Allies have insisted that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - forcing Eurosceptic members and Labour members to choose between her package and ‘unfortunate'.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to ‘tear up Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made lord and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If it had been responsible, we would have gone out now,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.'
Describing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that indicated that the public's view had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain absolutely wrong.'
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member of the Brexit party, was also in the march and told reporters: ‘I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition is not going to vote in favour of the scheme, it is unpopular among our party and active members who walk the streets in order to elect us in the first place.
Don't go ahead with Chequers and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘Prime Ministers retain their positions when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians had to ‘feel the pressure' if they wanted to ratify the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we won't let you do that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
'We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who secured a victory for us in terms of Brexit and we will continue until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, people in favour of Stay through Birmingham marched before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tories flags against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
One of Labour's lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues they had with the party's app as the conference opened.
‘Rain are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canadian deal plus, for uninterrupted borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he said.
‘It's a complete farce.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren seriously about applying for the president's job
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. Senators says she will "look in detail at applying to be president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a provincial Representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-chaired the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
She said she would be able to compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she met with constituents for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took office.
Someone who was present asked if she intended to stand for the president's position.
Warren said it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man who can be seen in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the University of the South campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died instantly as a result," Murphy J. Paul, one of the chief police officers, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he confessed to being on site, possessing a weapon, and he confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an investigation and was placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6 foot and 6 inch boy who grew up in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team's order helped him win the lead on Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas applied before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the order of the Mercedes team" would play a major role in the race.
From the post, Bottas got a good start and nearly left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pit allowing Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been fateful.
The Mercedes went to the lap pit later coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, in disbelief, leave the inside free in danger of catching going after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then headed for a large part of the race as he held on in his tyres to try to finish quickly and pass to Kimi Raikkonen to secure the fourth position.
He finally came to the poles on lap 44 but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came to fourth position.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a gentleman letting me pass.
The team has done a great job of getting one two," said Hamilton.
That's a very bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday because she said she did not share the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
As he spoke at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence that Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead he said that what goes on in Parliament shows that people are "hate and evil and a liar."
The same thing could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on in the last days in Parliament, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and evil and a liar," he said.
"When you look at statements and the documents that are shared and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
It didn't do me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember her answer... did you share the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't share the document."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't do it, we didn't do it," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter containing details of the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and was shared in early September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story," Feinstein told The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter confidential and I did as she asked."
But the president didn't seem to believe her, and he made a comment during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you something, the language of her body was very poor.
It may not be, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to their own ends.
"They are determined to take back the power by any means necessary.
You see the hatred, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control," the president told Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made it right for a loss in the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won the front early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer restored the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard levelled the score for Dundee before two-time Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams met this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide a Cownie equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the lead in the first break as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, once again, Bouchard ensured they had an equal score with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Manager Kills to Ensure Hundreds on Aircraft Can Detonate Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is called a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people lifted off the ground safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still hitting the area and many are stuck in a rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his co-workers had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the highly shaky control tower at Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely pick up.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Hearing the news is heartbreaking," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities are worried that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster mitigation agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number is probably still rising because there are still many bodies under the debris and many bodies that have not yet been reached," said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave that reached six metres has disrupted Palu, which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance brings bodies here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing from the little monsters everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
The situation is already disastrous, but it could get much worse."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the movement and transportation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini says one man is missing after a plane crashes into a lagoon
The airline that flew an aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man was missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had managed to leave the plane that was sunk.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen one man who had been travelling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials say seven people have been transported to a hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people were still in hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. Airline and Naval company has said the aircraft has landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane had gone over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had been able to walk through water to their centre to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the plane's staff were agitated and yelling, and that he had suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working to improve nearby quays and that they had helped save people by using a windboat to transport people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aircraft Safety Network shows that 111 people died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents in the last two decades but none of those included Air Niugini.
The night before the fire, a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented its case on Saturday in the re-trial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
She outlined to the jury how she used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the movements of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers's mobile phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday saying he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
He said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
A few weeks ago, they found out that they only knew each other.
Rowlett said Tellis had deleted text messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
"He was out of his life," Hale said.
The defender will begin his keynote debates on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio want to challenge the negative picture of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which are political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to return to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nani from New York prosecuting a couple for her dismissal following a "racial" text message
A nanny in New York prosecuting a couple for discriminating against her and dismissing her after she received a text message misdirected by the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, saying that the situation was as if someone was "trying to benefit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she saw that childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NAAAAAAA PERSON DU OTHER." Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "annoying", dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that their old grandmother, who was African-American, had done terrible work and that she was instead expecting Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation because she was made redundant, and she tries to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple have criticised the claims that they are racist, saying that bringing Maurice's employment to an end was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried they could not trust her after her demise.
"My wife sent me something she didn't think she'd say.
She's not special.
We're not a racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the care of someone you've been rude to, even if that was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I do not think."
Comparing the legal case to "a position of someone trying to benefit", Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two weeks' time and that she was in a "very difficult position".
Are you going to kill someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing to do," said the investment banker.
Although the legal proceedings were still ongoing, it was little time before the court of public opinion condemned the couple on social media, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers fear that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's incredible success."
She said her father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a toy bear, would have accepted it if his work had been rejected, but added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "sweet and sweet" feeling after his death last year.
She said her father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success in a slight calm, describing the bear as "a very important member of the family".
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful man," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieves something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he's considering Paddington's success that way.
Although his creation and imagination was the work, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nothing was calling regularly to say that things were really bad, and she wasn't expected to come through," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Don't say she's going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beating began to come to an end and leave her system.
She had died a short time before and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave."
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her bereavement.
"Nobody knew," he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and he killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lights up any room."
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that that's going to have an impact again afterwards."
Ms Davis drew up the cards, "to let people know there are people they can go to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk."
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom of one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents he made no eye contact with them or anything like that."
He said his death had been a huge shock to them, but they had to come through it: "It's tearing a hole through my family.
It's breaking us into pieces.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins to investigate
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation - maybe we could secure a little bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "failing" in the midst of a inflammatory legislative repository.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to timing.
There are only five weeks to go until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans will do badly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to phone Senators, pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was a personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes on the floor of Parliament, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers 'slow down' under Kim's leadership
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South's merger administration, said there were 1,127 cases of fleeing last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter processes to control borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates that people's smugglers are raising, are key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
Most people fleeing from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and a country to which it is easier to cross than the highly protected Military Area between the two Koreas.
China refers to those fleeing as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and she often forces them back to their own country.
The relationship between North and South - which is technically still at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had come to a halt.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a brief discussion about working towards nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula.
But, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first at all," Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "irregular", saying he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "irregular" and said it was not appropriate, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribal Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called it "irregular," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of Parliament's Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying the claims that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost he yelled and choked by crying at times when discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him "destroyed his reputation in a coherent and monstrous way" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's evidence proves he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his evidence shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows that he's ineligible with those statements and the way he accused Clinton supporters and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to be confirmed, and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if it's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not fit to be in the Supreme Court or to be in the court it's in at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said she as a Democrat was worried about Kavanaugh's possible cases against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse the Supreme Court's specific decisions.
"This is not the time to have someone irresponsible and prejudiced in court expecting us to say, ‘is that great?'," Pelosi said.
And the girls have to talk about it.
It is a righteous conversation, months and years of rage accumulating, and it cannot be rid of without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique and so, when she gets angry and starts crying, she will tell the person who is talking to her, "You think my goal is sad because I'm crying.
I'm a poor man."
And then she'll carry on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed to give expression to anger partly because they are, basically, misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I've had from an early job, in an office where men were the greatest, and I cried out with anger beyond words, is an older woman who grabbed me into the arms of my neck - a cold manager who always scared me - and dragged me into the staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're evil.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a courtship outside a marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrawn from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized that there was no reason she should not think about applying for the president's position herself.
"I didn't think about it," he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing he needed was another.
We've been called "The Seven Deadly Sins" and "The Seven Deadly Sins."
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she promised she would not take part in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a vain battle.
She noted that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings went too far for her - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger due to the gender bias - and she began to cry.
"You would think my nerves had crashed," Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my incorporated sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravestone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be in favor of Beijing
The first wave of the U.S.-China trade war was enough to deafen someone, and while the battle is not over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting the value of $200 billion (£150 billion) of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid back the pound every time and, most recently, it has set tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match US efforts and the world's largest but one economy is likely to surrender soon.
Getting Washington to quit means surrendering to the requirements, but public embarrassment to the U.S. would raise far too much shame on Xi Jinping, China's president.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing can get around it right, the pressures of U.S. trade war could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies depend less on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start economic panic in either country is, in fact, far more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused contact researcher at the New American Security Center, who is a debating thinker.
Syria 'prepared' for asylum seekers to be returned, Foreign Minister says
Syria says they are ready to accept asylum seekers back voluntarily and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to renew the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The conditions are now right for asylum seekers to be accepted back into the country after having to flee terrorism and the damaging economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not receive help with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe have won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The USA has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure victory as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the required 14.5 points to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had had a difficult tournament, but when the star ball landed from the US in the water on the 16th hole par-3 he had to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the golfer from Italy, had starred in every round, becoming 1 of the 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was crushed 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who probably played in his last Ryder Cup.
While playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful player ever in the tournament's history with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not usually one to cry, but I can't help that today.
It's been a tough year for her.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
The team that matters, and I'm glad I've been able to help," Garcia said through her tears after Europe won.
The baton transferred to fellow countryman John Ram who beat U.S. golf hero, Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the game to the singles on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods because I had grown up watching him play golf," said Rahm, a 23-year-old youth.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, meaning that his record was now in the Ryder Cup at 13-21-3.
And that's a strange statistic to one of the best players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had struggled through the weekend to find the clear way.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
We had put pressure on Europe during the morning.
We did battle.
You have to give credit to Thomas.
He's a captain without his second.
Each of his 12 players played very well.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move on.
I love my 12-year-old son and I'm proud to be one of them.
You've got to pick them up.
They played better than us."
