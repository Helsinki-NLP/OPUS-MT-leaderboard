Welsh AMs are concerned that ‘they would look like leopards'
There is a surprise among some AMs before the recommendation that their title should be changed to MWPs (the Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The astonishment came as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
All over the political spectrum, AMs are afraid that they would be a joke.
One AM told the Labour Party that his group was worried that "he makes a rhyme with Twp and Pwp"
Nod to readers from outside Wales: stupid twp and pwp means shit in Welsh.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was "not happy" and that alternative proposals have been made.
One of his colleagues told the Conservative Party that his group was widely known about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and ‘Muppet’ in the English language.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same way as the pronunciation of the letter u in the English Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the changes to the name said: "It is obviously up to the MEPs themselves to take the final decision on any reporters under the name that Assembly Members will be given."
The Welsh Assembly was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals which received widespread support for the nomination of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of AMs, the Commission's choice was Welsh Parliament Members (WMP - Welsh Parliament Members), but it was the MWP choice that received the most support in public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternatives, but the difficult to come to any conclusion could be heartbreaking for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on the question of what title they would be called when they discuss the legislation.
The day of the vote for the people of Macedonia is in the referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will send their vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
A referendum pact was reached as part of an effort to negotiate a decades-long dispute with border Greece, which also includes a province with the name Macedonia.
The government in Athens for a long time argued that the name of its northern neighbors constitutes a claim for its territory, and brought successive protests against their application for membership with the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the same as the price to be paid if EU and NATO membership is to take place.
St. Martin's Clock Quiet and Failure at Churches in Harlem
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church around every corner," Mr Adams said.
"There is no such thing today."
He said he understood the situation.
"People go out in different ways today," he said.
"The bars are no longer sitting rooms for the public as people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders are eager to, "and they will just be back to where they started sooner or later."
The church could be replaced by buildings of apartments, which are full of people who do not contribute to the remainder of the refuges in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white-necked people," he said, "and so they will accelerate the day that those churches are closed completely because most of those who move into those apartments are unlikely to become members of those churches."
The two churches were built with communities with a bright kinship before Harlem became a major city for people with a blue kinship - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Moth community moved to bright skin in the 1930s.
A community with a blue kinship took the title of the building, a community that used to worship close by.
A community with blue kinship took possession of St. Martin's under the Honour. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against 125th Street retailers, was on a major shopping street in Harlem, which was opposed by people with blue kinship to recruit or raise in rank.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the church was commissioned by parishioners with Father Johnson when they planned to rebuild plans.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martain's, baptized the "stone of the footstool" on the bell.
The expert who played the bell in July gave him something else: a "cultural deposit" and a "historical musical instrument whose replica could not be found."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first clock to be played by a blue-throated musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said he was not found by St. Martin's representative.
It was a complex story between architects and contractors seen at St. Martin's over the last few months, of the lay leaders of the church who introduced some of them, and of which the diocesan bishops introduced some of them.
It was the beavers - the parish's own governing body - who wrote to the diocese in July regarding their concerns that "the diocese would seek to bring forward the costs" to the beavers, although the beavers were not involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent in by the diocese.
Some of the parish's population made a complaint about the lack of transparency on the diocese's side.
A 13-year-old baby shark hurts while diving for lobster over in California
A 13-year-old boy's shark attacked and injured Saturday while diving in search of a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster diet, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego Chad Hammel said he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he tortured him over there to help remove him from the heel.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement from the birth of a lobster, and that he then realized that "it was a shout ‘We were stuck!
We've been spoiled!"
"It's all about him," Hammel said as he approached the boy.
"I beg everyone to leave the helm, 'There's a shark under the helm!'" said Hammel.
The boy was given an airlift to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is classified as having poor health.
It is not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue Guard Captain Larry Giles said at an intelligence meeting to the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was considered not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles told him that traumatic injuries to the victim were removed to his body's cream.
The officers closed an entrance onto the beach between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for enquiries and safety purposes.
Giles pointed out that there were no more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to land on the UK's scheme market.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their multi-division store-style scheme passes with a team of special assistants.
As part of the campaign, the UK's £2.8bn scheme market, which is still growing with declining fashion and household sales, will test the larger scheme passages in 11 stores around the country, and be brought to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in scenic goods comes as part of the supermarkets' effort to fill up shelf space in their former receivers of televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said they would be increasing the number of their scheme goods twice offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeover field, so that vegans will have a majority of the products usable - requiring more young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will be testing concessions in two stores with Sainsbury's, the first of which was opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, out in the year.
The trends of online shopping and to buy small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores are pushing supermarkets to do more to attract people in.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the venues will gradually look like department stores and the series of stores trying to resist the discount stores of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos centers in hundreds of stores, and also introduced several Habitats since they bought those two sets of stores two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and contributed to the profitability of the acquisitions.
A failure of the previous supermarket's effort to radically renew its schema and pharmacy sections.
Sainsbury's proved a joint venture with western Boots in the early 2000s, but the annexation was ended after a dispute over how to share proceeds from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy series, for £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but added a range of additions to the soothing brands of china care that would include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have radically changed the appearance and appearance of our schemed passports to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialist colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every demand, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean we are now a world class target that challenges the old shopping route."
Peter Jones ‘at madness' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million market
The star Peter Jones from Dragons was left mad after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his life-style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time available for his brand of household goods and accessories Truly.
The two's business and Goop's brand have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow..
It was on Instagram that the presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she is to leave.
Holly Willoughby has put star Peter Jones from Dragons Den on the red carpet when she withdrew from their profitable lifestyle brand business at the final duo - to focus on their major new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Our sources of information said that Jones was ‘at a red light' when the white girl of television admitted during a meeting full of tension Tuesday at the headquarters of her inner business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - which are worth up to £1.5 million - to focus on her brands of household goods and accessories Truly.
The business was compared to Goop's brand with Gwyneth Paltrow, and was predicted to double Willoughby's wealth estimated to be equal to £11 million.
And 37-year-old Willoughby, announcing on Instagram that she was to leave Truly, Jones embarked on a jet-liner out of Britain with one of his vacation homes as his goal.
The source said: "Truely was the head of priorities for Holly.
It would be a long-term future for her with which she would pursue her life for decades.
All those involved were withdrawn with their decision to leave the market.
No one believed in God, and no one believed in God.
There's a shop full of goods inside the Headquarters in Marlow that's ready for sale."
Experts believe that the event of the presenter This Morning, which is one of Britain's most profitable astronomers, could cost the firm millions due to the considerable investment in the products between cushions and candles and between clothing and household items, and could cause further delays to its launch.
And it could end a friendship that lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, with whom they have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past decade.
It was established by Willoughby alongside Capp West in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will join the cast of Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source of information close to Jones said last night "we will not comment on matters relating to his business."
"We're in love and we're in love"
He laughed about the criticism he would receive from the news media for the "non-presidential" comment to some people's eyes, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump has done so much?
Trump said while pretending he was a "news presenter".
"I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim expressed interest in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump announced as a major step forward towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Nuclear disarmament negotiations have come to an end.
There were more than three months since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korea's most prestigious diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the N.A. General Assembly last Saturday that the North does not see a "correct response" from the US on North Korea's initial efforts towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted that U.S. is still applying sanctions with the aim of keeping pressure on them.
Trump wasn't very good at his job.
"We're very close to the North Pole," he said.
"We're going to go to the North Pole.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim resulted in positive results - the rocket tests were discontinued, helped to release kidnappings and bring home the bodies of members of the American armed forces.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get admission to this crowded spot, 200 people would be standing abus," Trump said, referring to the crowd just in front of him.
Hundreds of people on an island are killed by tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
Following the earthquake on Lombok, for example, the foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not need to be on the scene.
Although no more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was expelled from their own areas, no national disaster was announced, which was a prerequisite for generating international aid.
"In many cases unfortunately they said inadvertently that they don't want international assistance, so it's very challenging," Mr. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is teaming up to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether the foreign team can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman with the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
In light of the earthquake seen in Indonesia on an ongoing basis, the preparations before the nature's annoyance are horrendously bad.
Although shelters were built against tsunamis in Aceh, they are not usually seen on any other coastline.
The apparent lack of a pre-industrial warning basin in Palu, although warning was in place, probably contributed to the number of lives lost.
Traveling between the continental islands of Indonesia is challenging when it rains.
The logistics becomes much more complicated with the natural disasters.
A hospital ship based in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, and it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo improved Indonesia's fractured infrastructure at the heart of his electoral campaign, and has spent a large amount of money on roads and railways.
But funding deficits affected the Joko administration as it embarked on its re-election the next year.
Mr. Joko is also coming under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their towns when clashes between Christian and Muslim groups took place on the streets, and masses, bows and arrows, and other rough weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge finds Liverpool equalising score at dual final against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge cleared Liverpool from losing the match against Chelsea in the Main League with his score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while about 30 yards out from Chelsea's bowler and his team to back 1-0.
He took the ball on his left foot before he released an attempt to remove the longer pole from him.
The effort flew high above the box as it approached a top-right corner of the net.
The ball caught just over the jump at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the end and fell into the net.
"I just wanted to reach that place, get the ball, and players like Shaq go ahead with as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I gave the ball one little blow and I didn't think so much about it and I tried it on the back."
Chelsea were 1-0 advanced by leatham after finding a score in the 25th minute with the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The central toss passed with his bridle for the team in the blue jersey west as far as Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning from midfield and bringing a rip about half of Liverpool's pitch.
Kovacic gave a pass and quickly departed in the middle of the park.
He then released a beautiful pass, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and gave the final blow into the furthest pole netting from his left foot over Alisson Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Naples at the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of dead in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be stranded about the debris of buildings laid down by the earthquake on a magnitude 7.5 that struck last Friday, and waves generated as high as 20 feet with it, as agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was full of debris from buildings that fell onto each other.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he stabbed a woman to death
An investigation has been launched into the murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was discovered at 7:55 a.m. with wounds sustained on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder..
Police have called on people who have heard or seen nothing to come to them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are early in the investigation but I would appeal to anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who thought anything with their dash cams to contact us as they may have information that would be critical to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local woman in Birkenhead, and was found within a property.
Friends of the woman who believed they knew her have come to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police have said they are currently informing the next of kin of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police are telling him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he learned of what had happened.
Residents are now being told that there will be a number of times before they are allowed to re-enter.
One policeman was heard telling one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came in and took off her shoes.
She's saying "this is terrible."
There were two vans with the police within the line of defence at 2pm, with one other van just outside it.
Several policemen were standing within the line of defense monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention logs 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell’s statue in Parliament is the latest to be the subject of controversy over the ‘rewrite of history’
Their destruction would be a compensation for their complete destruction such as the Taliban's many of England's religious cultural casualties under the hands of their fanatical followers or the Puritans as they were baptized.
The Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history"
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate on the removal of the prospects of a true Cromwellian Oliver outside of the Palace of Westminster would be expected to become a target.
He didn't want to take responsibility for himself or his actions at the hands of the British government.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the first place.
The real beauty that William Hamo Thorneycroft painted on Cromwell is evidence of speculation in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography about someone that many people believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps no more than in the 19th century today, would have felt about Cromwell being the parliamentary defender against the external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
This is still a matter of historical debate on the subject.
The mid-17th century conflict has been the foundation of our nation's development ever since, and it is an identifiable individual who represents one half of that divide.
It's also worth celebrating and commemorating his achievements as a Lord Defender."
The death of a farm animal is actually a death sentence
Pigs attacked and killed a farmer within a market in southwestern Sine, according to local media reports.
The man with the surname ‘Yuan' was found dead with his cut artery, while on a mat with blood near a pig's apron at the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines in the pigs at the pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
It was reported that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province last Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin came to him the next morning as he was dead, and found a door valve with a nearby pig's aperture was spreading.
He said that there was a large male pig in the chest with blood in his mouth.
It was confirmed by a forensic examination that the pig had made a fierce attack on the farmer or died, according to the report itself.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and spoiled," said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu,' about as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Filming from the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about once.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in such a way that it would not attack anyone else, with the police gathering evidence at the scene.
It is reported that the Yuan people and the market authorities are conducting negotiations on compensation for his death.
There are records in the annals of cases where pigs have been made to humans even though they are rare.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, and sustained critical injuries.
A decade earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds added a Welsh farmer against his tractor or that his wife scared the animal to death.
It was after pigs ate their farmer over in Oregon in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not usually aggressive but a tasting of the blood can function as ‘sweet.'
"They just want to get away.
They treat you like animals, they treat you like animals, they don't treat you like animals.
You have to respect them," he said.
Heavy rainfall will come widely to the southwest of the U.S. from the remains of Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving it over the colder heath off the northern coast of Mexico.
The floods with Rosa will come from rainfall across northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the next few days.
Winds of 85 miles per hour affected Rosa, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move from the north of Sunday.
Meanwhile, a clash is coming to an end over the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward towards the US West Coast. While Rosa approaches the Baja California Sunday peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity deep north into the southwest of the US.
Up to 10 inches of rainfall with Rosa will come to parts of Mexico next Monday.
It is then that heavy rainfall will be created extensively with the tropical moisture interacting with the cliff approaching into the Southwest for a few days.
Between 1 inch and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 2 and 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in parts of the Southwest, particularly over most of Arizona.
Floods could occur with the conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered type of tropical rainfall.
He decided to go out into the desert to escape the danger of the tropical rain.
Heavy rains may cause horrific flooding in the rivers, and local wind shears and dust will come blowing with the thunderstorms.
Some heavy rainfall will come with the clash approaching parts of the southern California coast.
The number of rainfall could be above meandering, which could generate minuscule flows and slip roads accordingly.
This is the first of its kind in the region.
Some scattered tropical rain showers approaching Arizona will begin late Sunday and early Monday, before the more widespread rainfall will spread late Monday and Tuesday next.
The four of them are in the four corners of the earth, and the four of them are in the middle of the earth.
Intensive fluctuations in temperature can be seen in October throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, with the temperature staying average warm.
As a result, changes occur over a period of time.
A great example of the amazing temperature variations will be seen throughout the center of the Sunday U.S.
There will be a nearly 20 degree variation in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days the final summer heat will try to resurface.
A hot start for October is predicted to be seen throughout much of central and eastern USA, with the temperature in the 80s widely over the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
80 degrees could be found in New York City on Tuesday, and there would be 10 degrees in and out over the average temperature.
We are showing with our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability of above-average temperatures for the US eastern half through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the very interesting evidence from the nominee Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her, with the allegation that the 1980s attack, Christine Blasey Ford, took place on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political upheaval continued, with the broadcasters breaking into regular registration for Friday's final outing: an agreement negotiated with Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona to face the FBI to conduct an investigation into the changes that would last one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh hugged her while intoxicated, and tried to remove her clothes for her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his teaser testimony, claimed that he's one hundred percent certain of it didn't happen.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people reported sighting Nielsen on Friday.
That firm included the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks on display, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And a number of dunes usually apply to Nielsen by measuring the number of people who look into the offices.
As a comparable measurement rod to that, the number of spectators is the same as your qualified match in American football.
The appointment of Kavanaugh was strongly supported by Fox News Channel, whose host-representatives were advanced among the networks with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of the last Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning getting mealtimes from demonstrators while trying to take a lift to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He was standing with his eyes about it for several minutes while they were throwing him over, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in front of the country?
Someone said to her, "Yours is the power and many women have little power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and told him that, before the lift was closed, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were covering courses hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote to put forward Kavanaugh's nomination for the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the assumption that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minority wanted.
His conversations were with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, who insisted on Flake.
It was after a conversation with Coons and several later senators, that Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerless, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to give Kavanaugh approval without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations regarding Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses his critics of being engaged in political games on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of engaging in "political games" about Britain's future and taking national interest in interviews with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the headline on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson pushed forward his attack on his plan for Brexit, or so-called Chequers plan, stating that the proposal would see Britain and the European Union collect each other's tariffs as a "major future" proposal.
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
The police suspect Wayde Sims' death in a fatal shooting, who is a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and registered in prison with a second-class murder charge, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officers released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses from the scene and said they found DNA with Simpson on them, as reported by WAFB, an affiliate with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to Wayde's fatal shooting.
The bond was set for him at $350,000, which the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report last Friday, stating that a shot wound in the head and into the neck was the cause of death.
The department is recognising the Louisiana State Police taskforce on refugees, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assistance with the investigation coming to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for "his dedication and determination to accomplish justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6 foot 6 inch starter grew up in Baton Rouge as his father Wayne also played basketball with LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game that he found last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team were "confused" and "satisfied" with Wayde's death.
"It's a matter of concern," Wade said.
Ashes are crushed from a volcano past Mexico City
The ashes erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano have come down to southern areas of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexican people on Saturday to stay clear of the volcano after the activity increased inside the crater, and registered 183 gas and ash emission in 24 hours.
The center had been monitoring multiple earthquakes and earthquakes.
The images on social media showed that there were thin layers of ash cover on the windshields of cars in the areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted an increase in activity at the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) away southeast of the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Disputes between police and Catalan separatists took place before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between demonstrators for independence and riot police, with thousands taking part in competitive demonstrations to mark a one-year anniversary of the Catalan split vote.
A group of separatists with chickens roamed eggs and powdered paint cast on the riot police who were being held back, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Sculptures also occurred out in the day, with the police using their sanctions to restrict the fighting.
People in favour of independence chanted "Forgiveness, Forgiveness, Forgiveness" directly in front of unionist demonstrators shouting "May Spain live."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the demonstrations, the local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region where a desire for independence is found there is one year after the October 1 referendum considered by Madrid to be illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose to be independent with a high majority, although the percentage that came out with a boycott was low the vote among the odds against the majority separation.
According to Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the vote at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
A group of people in favour of independence had taken up residence on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they had to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the demonstration of segregation with his wife said he no longer had the hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
"We've seen one of the best times we've ever had.
"I saw my parent crying with wonder that they could vote, but we're stranded now," he said.
Despite the fact that Catalan parties in favour of independence found a crucial victory if it were barely achieved in last December's regional elections, they were unable to maintain that continuity this year with many of their recognizable leaders either self-exiling or being detained awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and consequent liberation proclamation.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration to support the police on his phone, said the conflict was sustained by politicians from both sides.
"The tensions are rising unrelentingly," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were placed in thecarceration before his trial since the end of last year, announced that he would compete in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Competing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the reversal in the democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government," he said.
Man arrested after being hit by a car in his home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house was refloated by a car in Derry City.
The incident took place on Ceardstown Crescent Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been released with the car at some point.
Menga's score gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first back was for Livingston who saved the win
Livingston had an incredibly unexpected win over Rangers, and it was Steven Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games as manager of the association from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end while Gary Holt's team equalled Hibernian in second.
He leaves Gerrard's team without a win at home in the Main League the season as they face Hearts, and they are eight points to back, next Sunday.
Rangers will be at home previously against Rapid Wien in the Europa League next Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile adds his number of games without losing to six games, and Holt's head coach remains unbeaten since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston doesn't score opportunities against malignant visitors
Holt's team should have advanced long before they scored, and his direct method to Rangers had many difficulties.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line in the direction of the back but put his try across the back's mouth, and then Alan Lithgow was only able to get his try in after he slipped in to meet headbutt Craig Halkett across the back.
The home team were happy to allow Rangers to play in front of them, with the knowledge that they would damage the visitors from home with the fixed items.
And it was the way the back was scored.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston created semi-finals, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, which belonged to the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers were in possession of the ball at that time, but were unable to defeat the home team defenders and Liam Kelly's barrister,
That story continued out in the second half, although Kelly had to save from Alfredo Morelos.
With his feet his Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor knocked the door on Scott Pittman and gave Lithgow a flick in the get-together from another fixed item with Livingston.
Passes came across Livingston's box continuously and were constantly cleared, and two claims for a hiccup were rejected - after Halkett challenged the representative Glenn Middleton, and one on a handle.
"Unbelievable proof" from Livingston
Alasdair Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent quality and quality of life.
They were all over the place, and their hopes were overshadowed.
Their playing style and personnel have changed little since they came back to the main section, but Holt must be highly commended for how he has inspired the team since coming in.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was excellent, supervising the king-organized defenders, and Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their fags from the start.
There is no shortage of players for the Rangers.
Despite the fact that they once gave great proofs about Gerrard, they came to the back of those standards.
The last pass was missing them - they only broke through the home team once - and it's an eye-opening type for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne.
Smiling and blue skies were seen Saturday (September 29) with Turkish and German leaders meeting for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to repair relations between the NATO allies.
They were successful on a number of issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then faced Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population is found outside Turkey itself in that city.
The police cited security reasons for preventing the crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
The voice of hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan was also heard - many in Kurdish - as they sharply criticized Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The confrontational protests are a reflection of the visitor's segregation, worshiped as a hero by some German Turks and sharply criticized as autonomous by others than them.
Road crash in Deptford: A cyclist dies by collision with a car
A cyclist has died in a collision with an inner car in London.
The crash occurred near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics attended the scene, but the man died there.
The crash comes several months after another cyclist died in a crash and fled Childers Street, about one mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
There are closed roads and bus diversions, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers during an anomaly
Six prison officers have been injured during a confrontation at the men's high-security car park, the Prison Office said.
The anomaly occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Officers and specialists "Tornado" were introduced to tackle the confrontation, involving eight prisoners and confined to one side.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to their faces at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Experienced prison staff have been deployed to combat an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not accept the violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be put before the police and that they may be placed further incarcerated."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
It was reported in June that the governor of the prison received medical treatment in the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And riot officials were called in last October to tackle a serious confrontation in which the team was attacked by volleyball.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood plains (which may be a benefit to drought-affected areas)
A tropical lagoon rarely faces Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week with the remnant of Hurricane Rosa's energy targeting over the Southwest Desert, with flooded occupants risks.
The National Weather Service issued flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Pheonix on Tuesday, and that he will be winding up approaching Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in a tweet that there have been only "ten tropical cyclones that have maintained their tropical or tropical storm status within 200 miles of Pheonix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center are projected to be 2 inch to 4 inches of rainfall, and discrete sizes of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, including Central Rockies and The Great Basin, appear to have 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, with isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those who are now out of the risk of tulca, Rosa's rainfall could be a blessing because there is drought in the region.
While flooding is a serious concern, some of that rainfall may be beneficial as drought is currently in part of the South West.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, there is at least a drought in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category," reported weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa passes across the Baja California Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, who still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is catching colder waters in the Pacific Ocean so it has lost power.
Therefore, she is expected to land in Mexico at a tropical storm strength in the evening or Monday night.
The rainfall across parts of Mexico could be heavy, and there is a significant flood risk because of that.
"Flood totals of 3 to 6 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, and may include 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then go north across Mexico as a tropical storm before coming along with the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical lagoon, which will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main prize expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rainfall in California, north-eastern Sonora, and the US Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening floods and debris flows, and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted suicide
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after finding a 16-year-old boy lucky a few times in Somerset.
The boy was found in the teens and injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where he has a ‘stable' condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police say.
Officers are petitioning anyone who may have a piece of mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump said about Kavanaugh, that ‘he suffered, granularity, anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's uncompromising and scandalous tactics," Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered granularity, and anger" of the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegation.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's superiority and quality and bravery that day.
"A vote to certify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to certify one of the most competent legal intents of ours, a jurist with an excellent public service record," he told a crowd of West Virginia followers.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of a Republican ballot in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, and I'm actually running", he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump has said that he is "disappointed" and "disappointed."
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor regarding Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, GOP senior leadership expert spokesperson told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the earthquake, Indonesian tsunamis and the number of killed is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, and many people and large waves were swept away by the crash of the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island, Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) crashed on the shore falling at night, sweeping many of them to their death and destroying nothing in their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately so they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, in an intelligence session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it pulled with cars, loot, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, saying that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edgeboard.
Some people went up on trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, complex and broken bridges and mosques and water around it.
They followed the footsteps of God's people.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Assessment and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the major earthquake on Friday amounted to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb projected on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow harbour, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "widening" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found stuck under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he added, and said 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said "there was no information at all in the messages" from Donggala.
About 300, 000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, saying its staff and volunteers were on their way to the places they were beaten.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become more", she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not giving the information that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said waves had come in within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur filming piece on social media a man can be heard on the upper floor of a building and is tormented by alarming warnings about the tsunami approaching them to the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water enters the shore, bringing with it buildings and cars.
The steering wheels were not immediately visible.
The earthquake and tsunami that cut communications around Palu caused a major power cut, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began launching a cargo plane with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuation still badly requires food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief work only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palú on Sunday.
The number of people killed in Indonesia's Sudan exceeded 800.
It's all bad.
While the World Vision team from Donggala arrived safely to the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered in tarpol shelters created in the courtyard of their office, they went over devastation along the way, said Mr Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It's all bad.
Even with aid groups starting the relief work, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being blocked from travelling to Palu.
According to Palu regulations, regulations, funding, supplies and staffing will not flow from abroad until a disaster scene is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"But it's still a disaster on a provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K this is a national disaster,' we can open for international assistance but there is still no status.
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those still missing still had hope that their family members would become miracles that make natural disasters bleaker.
On Saturday, a small boy was removed from sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck in debris for two days and her mother's body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's paramilitary national team, trained two of the missing paramilitaries for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that some of the others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a junior in the paralegal field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told of how, in the hours following the spread of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse among the paraphilatelic community, he had sent a WhatsApp message to Palu's rivals, who were taking part in the beach festival, worryingly getting out of his power.
But his messages only resulted in a grey tick, rather than a pair of blue ticks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thefts cost $26,750 during an ATM refill at Newport on the Levee.
The robbers stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink worker who was replenishing the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment centre and making ready to deliver more money, which Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the issue.
When he was busy, "another man ran from the back of a Brink employee" and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw some suspects leaving the immediate, according to the issue, but the police did not state the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about who they are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap musician changes his name to Ye
His name is being changed by rap musician Kanye West - to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who was formerly known as Kanye West."
Ye's West, 41, has for some time now used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He will be on the show in his place of Ariana Grande who cancelled his arrival on the show for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West previously said the word was of religious importance to him.
I believe ‘ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,'" West said earlier this year, when discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"It's me, it's you, it's me.
It changed from Kayne, meaning the only one, to Ye - which is a direct expression of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of rap musicians with their name changed.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z performed without a flop and without big letters as well.
Amlo Mexico pledges not to use the weapon in the face of civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of brutal revenge against a student.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "not to use the army ever to suppress the Mexican people."
"Truth on peaceful demonstrations broke out at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies for those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that youth are attracted to criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
A.I. funding should be increased twice
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in that area, said AI researcher Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come in the wake of various parts of the U.S. government making AI advertisements, even where the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be in 1st place in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, taking into account that all other countries are much farther to the rear than the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in AI," Lee said.
By doubling the funding the chances of the next major AI discovery in the U.S. would be doubled as well, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most dominant AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the Othello American top ranked player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee previously acknowledged U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Projects Agency and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visions.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's giving away the academic leaders; it's the corporate companies," Lee said.
Leaders from universities working on AI in recent years have been employed by Facebook, Google and other technologies companies.
Lee said changes to migration policy could help U.S. boost AI efforts as well.
"I think a green card should be offered automatically for PhDs in AI," Lee said.
China's State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people at academic institutions like how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defence Division established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and academia are to be involved, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen in recent months in U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonian vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether or not to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia"," a measure that would resolve a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece prohibiting its offers of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim for its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist combat spouses claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and due to a boycotting campaign doubts are being cast as to whether or not the number of people voting will reach the 50 percent required so that the referendum is valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is well worth it to seek entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries leading up to the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because it means safer lives for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament said they will adhere to the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed for the name change.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voting only came out 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote for the referendum in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name to pave the way for its participation in NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform, and he was drawing up chairs in front of a tent built by the people who will boycott the referendum.
"We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride, not through the service door," said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to adopt us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will provide much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a very large majority will be in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that voting "in favor" would be "the affirmation of our future."
In a plebiscite published by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required voter turnout.
In another poll, conducted by Telma Television of Macedonia, it was found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one vote must be voted on.
The failure of the referendum would be a serious blow to Western government policy since it took control in May last year.
Sergio Aguero makes his way through all of Brighton's defenders for back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling placed Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win at Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's score was very easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian central starter got a pass at the center of the pitch at the start of the league.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open field.
There were four green shirts around Aguero then.
He pushed about one defender before running over a few other defenders on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then pushed a pass on his left side, arriving at Sterling.
England's toss used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to win Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a blow into the right of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about putting it playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the leading advantage in the Chiefs' clash.
The score was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball deep in the land of Brighton on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few contacts before guiding Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues' toss hit the ball into the grid before it slipped over a boundary.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler for Rockies
With the Nationals out of the competition of the casting game, there was little reason to force another start.
But Scherzer who is constantly eager to take the toll on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, hopes that if there are casting game implications for the Rockies only, that is ahead of a single game over the Angeles Dodgers in WL West.
The Rockies won at least a special invitation place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to win a title in the first division.
"While we're playing unjustly, at least we'll be able to put our foot in the row through a game and know that the atmosphere here in Denver will be with the crowd and with the other team playing it would probably be at the highest level of any point I'd be in front of this year.
Why don't we want to participate?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Saturday, but are said to allow Scherzer to pitch in such a case as usual.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, spent a practice lock session on Thursday and would pitch on his usual Sunday break.
The Washington debacle has 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 finishes in 220 2/3rds this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the case regarding his choice in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of a Republican ballot in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be in danger in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not in my running but I'm really in my running and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump then said, "You see this ugly, ugly radical group, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to return the power by using all necessary means, you see the granularity, the turbulence.
They don't care who they hurt, who they set to get power and control, that's what they need, power and control, we won't give them that."
It is a mission of the Democrats to "reject and block matters."
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, "bringing the Democrats "irreconcilable and ugly and disgusting and false."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee classifying Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein with her name, and made the audience flair loud as a result.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you get the document.
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm waiting for one - that body sign was all that bad - the worst body sign I've ever seen."
The Labour Party does not constitute a broad church anymore.
They don't talk to those who speak out.
Although the Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in the line of Labour MPs who were told that we're not welcome - that's all because we spoke out.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same because she stood resolutely against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the resolution criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, issues, ironically, that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the majority of my eight years as a local Labour Member, this was exactly the same as previous Friday's GC meetings.
Sadly today, that's not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and the promise of a "more kind, milder" politics has long since been forgotten if it ever really started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of different attitudes in the Labour party and each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy was made leader, as colleagues I had previously thought of had a similar political outlook and hoped that we would change radically and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with - whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and whatever I say - there will be a lot of abuse on social media calling for disselection, criticizing the politics of the centre, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not just my experiences.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm focused on are usually about politics.
I'm fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to put up with the brutality of sexual or cynical abuse every day without backing up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the way in which levels of abuse are now being embraced.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are not that wide church anymore and with every "confidence" resolution or change of selection rules the party is becoming narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years advocating not to draw attention to myself, not to speak out as much and then I would be "good enough."
But I didn't go to the polls to do that.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, inspired by the Thatcher government's neglect that left my comprehensive school classroom falling to the ground domestically, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never been involved in politics, not even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy position and areas that I did not agree with regarding the current leadership.
For those who put forward the resolution on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country is plowing for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But in reality my message isn't just about Nottingham Momentum, but it's about my constituents, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve them and I promise that threats of diselection or political activism won't stop me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr doesn't go to the top
There may have been two bad guys who made the final cut of a teen skew, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved a Tennants Mainland game this day which was very entertaining to win.
They're at the top of the table now, the only team out of ten teams to not win.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as how they took chances, that helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"We've tried it over our games so far, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie de Melrose said: "Our praise to Father, they took better chances than we did."
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's goaltender Frazier Climo, Ayr, scored, but due to a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, Warriors released for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the nets and Jason Baggot will take on an undisclosed win.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, he scored and then he saved a bounce from foot to hand to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with the young Patrick Anderson, who saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was given the pitch on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr pushed forward a flood through Stafford McDowall, who cleared Climo.
Acting captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose gave the extra man to pay for it with an unbeaten Bruce Colvine at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, from stretching out the penalty kick, MacPherson landed at the back of Ayr's clutch which was moving forward.
Climo, as he was doing from the restart, nearly sank after Kyle Rowe picked up a high kick over David Armstrong's shoulder and sent away the back-starter Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth.
It looks like there's still going to be a star Game going to a fresh career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be moving to the hospitality industry after discovering that he was named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford has the role of 56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, a show he writes with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill and with whom he co-stars.
The two announced that their upcoming ninth series will be the last during the show, and it appears that Kiernan is planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make a statement about the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivian landlocked hopes court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters equipped with rigs in La Paz.
A blue ocean flag is flown on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have been smeared with the motto: "The sea is ours from the right.
It is a duty to get it back."
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of its fringe losses against Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still glaring - as well as the prospect of launching on the Pacific once again.
That hope is the biggest hope for decades to come, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling from the international court of justice on 1 October following a five-year deliberation.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course she expects the result with a positive attitude," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be looking at CFP control on large screens across the country, with the confidence that the tribunal in The Hague will be in favour of the Bolivian demand - after turbulent talks over the past decades - that Chile has a duty to negotiate and bring a dominant outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the attractive indigenous president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - is also heavily dependent on Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and there would be little change for her to decide in her favour.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has ordered that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
Whereas six months' CBI control comes directly after hearing the final arguments are shown "that the case was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Sicilian expert in international law.
And not only was the Bolivian cause put forward, but it could have been put to the rear in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken possession of the issue of access to the sea", Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive propaganda did not do any good to overtake any remaining Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was more a trap than it usually is.
"A great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" will be given on Monday and a chance to "end 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most affectionate Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific", he added.
"It's good to see that we're breaking the law."
North Korea said nuclear disarmament would not take place if it can't trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons at first unless it has confidence in Washington.
He was speaking at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to take action in accordance with its word on the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the combating spouses.
His comments come and it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume nuclear diplomacy which was halted more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "a dream" that ongoing sanctions and U.S. refusal to declare to end the North Korean War in ever-increasing evil.
Washington is vigilant about agreeing to the declaration if Pyongyang does not take the first significant measures of disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is really about rejecting a weapon that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show depicts the latest line in massive headwinds that are on the way to Great Street near you.
If you want to make your hat collection bigger or block the sun completely it is no longer necessary to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a huge range of headgear spots for their SS19 collection on the demo platform that had an impact on the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
There were a lot of very unpractical hats being shown across Instagram this summer and those designers put their unbelievable works on the manicure scene.
In the conspicuous piece by Valentino there is an overgrown bearded hat on which is a broad leaf resembling feathers that swallow the bellies of the manicures.
Other huge accessories included watermelons with jewellery, a magician's hat and even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a strange mask selection-in-time for November.
Many of the stained masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than with haute couture.
There was one work like scuba diving equipment, snorkels and swimming glasses with it, while others were like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you follow the mass-produced statement you're also lucky.
Stylistic observers have predicted that the large, destructive bonnets may be making their way to the major streets close to you.
The giant hats come shortly after 'La Bomba', the straw hat on which a two-foot-wide leaf was seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly unprincipled hat that was being shown across social media has produced another major work on the manicure scene - a straw beach bag that is as big as almost the manicure on which the bathing suit carries it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, which featured rafia's frank dressing and had white leather straps, was the prominent piece in the SS19 Jacquemus' La Riviera Paris Fashion Week collection.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm hoping that big beach hats and bags will come to the main street next summer - since the designer had so much influence it would be hard to ignore the huge suitcases."
John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, followed in 2018 by a further series of outstanding examination results, which are reinforced by the success of individuals and all people together in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30, 000 students across Scotland, those schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that we can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we are seeing that the modern languages are becoming popular and have become a choice of mined materials in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
That is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on the English language if we want to build relationships with and trust people from other countries.
From the latest examination results this year, we see that languages are at the top of league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved grade A Honours.
In the data, collected from 74 SCIS membership schools, it was shown that 72 percent of the students achieved Grade A Honours in Mandarin, while 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French and 63 percent studied Spanish Grade A as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now viewed as a subject choice, as are STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers had a language skills deficit.
Therefore language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With languages needed for more potential job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession a person would choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future that they have a lifelong skill similar to this skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically promote a multilingual person to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language that had a bi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in language teaching.
If children have more than one language, especially those in developing economies, they will be more likely to find sound employment.
Different languages will be taught in each school.
Some schools will focus on the most classic contemporary languages, while other schools will teach the languages that will be considered the most important languages for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages are still of paramount importance to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, languages should actually be viewed as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It's got to be good to watch.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland.
LeBron will play his first game against the Lakers in San Diego.
The wait is about to be over for fans to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first game of the preseason against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes it will play remains to be decided.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website".
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited moment.
Following a rehearsal earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans with a six-week Lakers pre-season schedule".
"There are no pre-season games at this point in my career that I need to prepare for," he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, you tube channel
President Donald Trump launches a number of rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five mobilizations in the coming week, stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to keep the one he chose for the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to get support for the mid-term elections because Republicans are at risk of losing their control in the Federal Parliament, when votes are cast on November 2.
What time will Trump's West Virginia mobilization take place tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's mobilization at Wheeling, West Virginia is due to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's mobilization in West Virginia live online on You Tube.
Trump is most likely to talk about the hearings taking place in relation to Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court. The hearing had tensions over allegations of sexual misconduct. The Senate confirmation vote has been postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main aim of the upcoming week's series of rallies is to help Republicans, who are facing tough competitions, speed up their campaign.
So, President Trump's campaign pointed out that these next five mobilizations during the week were aimed at "encouraging the volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Commons," according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so essential to its program that the president will visit as many states as he can, as the busy campaign season unfolds," Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Wesbanco Airport is set to be mobilized tonight in Wheeling and could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and gain publicity from the media in Pittsburgh," according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 points in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come to try to bring about a surge in the polls" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia university, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup USA Team shows that they are eager to be optimistic before the Sunday singles rounds.
After a three-week hiatus, it's likely that the four-year-old will be able to get what he wants.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that is made up of sports, but the players strongly believe in it, especially at competitions like this.
Where are they now, then?
"They were six points ahead and now it's reduced to four points, so there's a little momentum about us," said Jordan Spieth as he walked for the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage that is four points ahead and twelve still to play.
The Americans, however, are optimistic and have a great cause for optimism, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, throughout the day and can argue that they have won three points out of four.
He's a good example from the outside world and he's a good example.
The scornful cheers of the celebration became higher as the round went on; he found necessary hits to win game four, when he and Thomas were two to one to end after two holes.
The hit he got won the game at 15 and the cheers were let go, the kind you say the American team hasn't lost the competition.
"You have to keep your courage and focus on your own game," Spieth said.
That's what every player has left now.
18 holes to look for.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, over the past two days have gone by are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair have won four out of four, which is odd but delightful and can't do anything that's wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair that did not hit bogs on Saturday evening, but they avoided kissing, as well, Saturday morning, Friday evening and the second nine holes on Friday morning.
The unspeakable game they played and the way they get energy from the loud audience shows that they are both the players to be victorious on Sunday; and no player would be any more handsome to win a European victory under the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them win at the same time, but at different holes.
But it's too early to talk about European glory.
It didn't take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to win Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four balls, and Alex Noren, his partner.
The Spaniards and Swedes were stuck in a hole and couldn't escape after they got a bog and two doubles in the front nine holes.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you escape from a hole that you yourself are stuck in.
The four balls and the four game are so attractive, if carefully considered, due to the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy changes in the blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team to this point and are well ahead of entering the final day, but this four-match match showed that Team USA has a fighting desire, although some people, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe are ahead 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good advantage at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four balls and the four game, when they were ahead of the US 10-6.
The exciting two, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, dominated the conflict when they had two victories over struggling Tiger Woods to reach four points to that point at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to win the coil, which they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, were again in the top spot against the failing American team, in the four balls, which left the series at 3-1.
There was a lot of excitement in the American team in the four balls; they won two games but were unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's singles matches to keep the coil.
Fleetwood is the first European greenback to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who were baptized ‘Molliwood' after a super weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the four games started in Ryder Cup history.
They had a big win on Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and played both as a unit to win on Woods, who was underwhelmed, and on Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, with 5 and 4.
Woods who had struggled in two matches on Saturday, showed great play now and again but 19 out of 29 games, which he played, he has now lost in the four balls and four games and has now lost seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break when the four balls ran in the morning and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the four games and beat 2 and 1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are guaranteed as the world's first and third golfer.
Europe, however, was not easy in a pleasant day, winding south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the main competitions three times, and Justin Thomas, set the standard for the Americans when they won by two points on Saturday.
They won convincingly against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four balls, although they lost the first two holes.
It only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team came back from a four-point deficit in the singles competition, although Furyk's team only needed to be on a combined score to retain the coil, because they won the coil last year.
After being in second place for two days, however, they are unlikely to be able to counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is ‘no chance' that they will unilaterally disarm due to lack of confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that ongoing sanctions were adding to their lack of confidence from the United States and that there was no way that the country would give up its nuclear weapons, unilaterally, in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the United Nations that during the past year North Korea showed "very good will" in that, insofar as it stopped nuclear tests and missile tests, it took the spot nuclear tests consecutively and pledged not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see any similar response from the United States," he said.
"With no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm, first of all."
While Ri again made common North Korean complaints regarding the United States, which opposed a "gradual" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be given concession, as she took small steps, her statement seemed important in that it did not reject a net of unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President, who was still in office, and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work "to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea is trying to officially end the Korean War, 1950-53, but the U.S. says Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons in advance.
Washington has also opposed applications to alleviate severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that "nuclear disarmament will be done first" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve their intended purpose in a coercive manner, and opposes "a declaration about the war being over", even said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can strike us is an idea from people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that sanctions, which are continuing, are contributing to our lack of confidence.
Ri made no reference to another summit being between Kim and Trump, which the American leader mentioned at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party involved in this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be in a position like this."
However, the way Ri spoke in his speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be targeted at a U.S. refinery after Trump, "Mr. Evil President", "rocket man" on a suicide mission to call Kim.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , although he threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea. He said, however, that much work still had to be done and the sanctions would be maintained until North Korea committed nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not intend a certain time for the disarmament, stating, "if it takes two, three or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "Security Council sanctions would have to be enforced strongly and without any failure until nuclear disarmament was fully achieved and confirmed."
The Security Council has, unanimously, increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballast programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edges of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the month ahead to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit to North Korea has not been as good as his last.
He left Pyongyang in July, stating that progress had been made; but North Korea denounced it within a few hours because it made "claims about it as a fraudster would do."
North Korea in a meeting with Moon this month promised it would destroy the presence of a missile, if the United States would take "appropriate measures."
He said that Kim told him that his "comparative measures" were Trump's security promises in Singapore and taking steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University has begun this year to allow all undergraduates to have more sleep to counter the growing culture of manly, studying through the night with the help of caffeine.'
A student discovered that students in the university, who are in the first place in the world, have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put the course together, believing this course to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He got inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said: ‘Why wasn’t this told to me before, when I was in my senior year?’
"She said no one told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was made available for the first time this year, explains to students the main points on good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and athletic functioning, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's medical services, said the university had taken a decision to introduce the course, when it found that students lacked sleep during the week.
An interactive series of tasks is part of the hour-long course.
In one section, there is an image of swanlios, in which students knead coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to respond to the effects of caffeine and light and the way in which lack of sleep affects athletic exercise and the importance of routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus breezes with interactive icons, the people who take part to reflect on their daily routine.
‘We know that it will not change student behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to be informed- about how you would have the right to be aware of the health effects that smoking would have on you," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride associated with ‘stay seated during the night', he said. According to him modern technology means and the pressure on students, which is constantly increasing that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
A student should ensure that he has sufficient sleep of good quality as a ‘secret tool', he said, to avoid stress, dizziness and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep affects the brain in a mode of hunger, as he regularly hungers.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, having completed one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and urged him to look for a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all undergraduates to do a similar study program, before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at waking time and be aware of the adverse effects of ‘blue light' coming from electronic screens and LED lights. They can obviate your daily rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's back wins on Gerrard's man
Rangers lost again from home as, due to the back injury to Menga, Steven Gerrard's misplaced team defeated 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox's team were looking to get their first home win, since they won 4-1 at St Johnstone in February. But they were defeated by Gary Holt's team, Gerrard's second out of 18 games as manager.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before half-time and there was no likelihood of Rangers, who were short of inspiration, being joint scorers.
As long as Rangers have fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third place and there is only a difference of backs between them.
Rangers could face further trouble, after the lineman, Calum Spence, received treatment for an injury in the head from some material apparently thrown from the viewer's point of view away from home.
Gerrard made eight changes to the easily winning team for Ayr to get a place in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11 players, who took a point from Hearts the week before and would be delighted with the way in which his well-trained team had adhered to the opponent's spouse.
Rangers may have had possession of the ball for the most part but Livingston was more concerned with the possession they received.
Livingston should have received a score after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who gave a kick towards Allan McGregor's back but went on a forearm.
Keegan took Jacobs free-kick who went to captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow failed with his chic but put him on a foray.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed like they had hopes rather than a belief in the kind of play they had played, in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he deserved an epic kick after a quarter of an hour, when he hit against Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson did not accept Columbia man's petition.
Rangers only managed to put two chics towards the back but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no difficulty in defeating head coach Lassana Coulibaly and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's kick might have been in the 34th minute against the patron of the play, it can't be denied that they didn't deserve it because they had made a great effort.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a fixed item in the starters since Jacobs.
Scot Arfield did not respond to a pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and gave a pass to Menga, who placed him in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change was immediately affected as he sent a pass to Morelos, who hit it in the direction of the back but Kelly, who had a super-game, rushed from his line to overcome the ball.
But Livingston continued to attract the visitors to play the kind of game they enjoy. Lithgow and Halkett continued to beat the ball up the pitch several times.
Holt's team could have had an extra score towards the end of the match but McGregor stood the ground well to defeat Jacobs and gave Lithgow a breakthrough blow from a corner chic that went on foreboding.
Rangers' representative, Glenn Middleton, had a late claim to an epic kick when he faced a confrontation with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the referee, looked in the opposite direction.
Almanag: Geiger Counter Initiator.
And now page from our German "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today.....the day a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, was born "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery from which the device was made known as the Geiger Counter.
A cornerstone of science since then is the Geiger Encounter, which became a cornerstone of pop culture, as well. In the 1950s, the film featured Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as stars. While not expected, they were scientists in the film:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Enumerator, used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radioactivity released from the minerals."
He said, "Yes, he's going to die right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The name is still there, though.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' rogue cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' and kill rogue cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells as part of medical treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then ‘see' a protein that is common in many cancers and then are reinjected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients, who have different types of cancer.
For one woman who received treatment with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system how to identify rogue cells, the entire ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see' protein, which is common in many types of cancer, and is known as HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings indicate that we have a highly-expected vaccine."
"Some types of cancer" are caused by HER2, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancers and choleretics, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from patients and in which they were "teached" how to target cancer cells to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West started on the run for Trump, while wearing a MAGA Hat after he was on SNL.
It didn't go well with him.
Kanye West was hit in the studio after Saturday Night Live after giving a free demonstration he praised the United States and President Donald Trump, who would stand for office in 2020, he said.
When he sang his third song called Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat and began to clamp down on Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"I speak so often in the name of a bright person who says: 1. How could you love Trump, not a racist?
"If I were to be worried about racism, I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a magic sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Holywood star joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault, made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded Kanye West's vocals on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to joke about West with the post.
He also complained to the public that he was being abused by the police.
"They put me in the backseat.
They said: ‘Don’t go out there with that hat on you.’
They've bullied me!
And then, they say I'm rather low," according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the low place?" he said "it would put a superman's cabin on it because that means you can't order me. Do you want the world to move on?
"Trying to love."
He was bullied at least twice because of what he said and it seemed that staff members were unaware, <0xC2><0xA7><0xC2><0xA7><0xC2><0xA7> Variety reported; one person told the magazine; "The whole studio was silent."
West was called to the show as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boss, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West put many people together with an exhibition of the song ‘I Love it' dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
The head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner backed West in a tweet: "For one of the most courageous individuals: Thank you for standing up against the damshell crowd."
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter made a tweet that said Kanye West was "as it is and that's all great."
"But I choose not to compensate a person (to buy his music or to support his "art") who, I think, is accepting and preaching an ideology that harms my own community.
It's free.
"We are, too," he said.
Before the show, the rap musician announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his official name now was Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the famous musician, the late Prince, changed his name to Symbol Il and then to the artist who was already known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacked by poisonous ferocity.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent, medieval fantasy series ‘Game of Thrones’.
But the 31-year-old actor criticized stereotypes of the fearful hero, stating that such on-screen parts mean that young boys often think that they need to be hard so that they are respected.
Speaking to ‘Sunday Times Culture', Kit said that he believes ‘something has risen wrong' and questioned how to deal with the problem of poison fertility in the <0xE2><0x99><0xAF>MeToo era.
Kit, who married his 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also recently admitted that he feels 'strong' when it comes to dealing with the issue.
‘Personally, I feel strongly at the moment - where are we going to go wrong with kindness?’ he said.
‘What did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?’
Kit believes that television may be responsible, to a point, for the increase in poison fertility, thanks in part to the characters who are extremely fearful.
He continued: What is it and what is it?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, it lets young boys know that they have to be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions - how do we change that?
It's obvious that something has become wrong for a young man."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in preliminary or follow-up stories, when the series ends next summer, stating that ‘there are no more battlefields and horses from him'.
From November, Kit will have a major role in the revival of True West Sam Shepard, a story about his brother, who is a thief, film producer and storyteller.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
‘I met my wife on this show and, so, he gave my children and my future life,' he said.
Rose participated in Ygritte, which Kit's character, Jon Snow, fell in love with in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's family estate lawn in Scotland.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease is on over 820,000 in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were spread through sex, a change from the pre-existing scenario.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through part of China, due to an infected blood transfusion.
But there is a huge decrease in the number of people receiving HIV like this and, barely, anyone is receiving it like this now, Chinese medical officials in the province of Yunnan said.
However, from year to year, the people with HIV and AIDS have increased by 100,000.
It is a confrontational issue in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LADT) community of China's HIV spread through sex.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Studies show that 70%-90% of men, who have sex with men, eventually marry women.
Much of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is deficient in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to have full availability of HIV medication to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data and condemns ‘dangerous lies and conspiracy theories'.
United States 1. Representative Maxine Waters criticized allegations on Saturday that a member of her own team leaked personal information about three Republican senators in the United States or that the information was posted by the staff member on the law makers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat pointed out that the information was being promoted by commentators from the ‘real right' and at websites.
"False lies, lies and more ugly lies" Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that home addresses and phone numbers were among the information provided. U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch who both come from Utah.
The information was made available online on Thursday. An unknown person posted it on Capitol Hill while a Senate panel was examining allegations of sexual misconduct, attributed to the perpetrator, who had been nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leak was provided sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses recognized that the source of the posts was related to the Waters office" and that the information regarding a Waters staff member was provided by the Hill reported.
"This allegation is completely false," Waters continued.
The staff member - whose identity, personal information and security has been provided, as a result of these allegations, was not fraudulent and falsely responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This allegation, which is unfounded, is completely false and outward."
Waters’ statement was immediately criticized online. Among those who criticised her was a former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"It's a shame," Fleischer wrote.
This implies that it is not fit to be a member of Congress.
When something is attributed to someone who has not done it, it should not be angered.
It should not be challenging.
He should not question the reasons for the charger.
He needs to be calm and calm.
The likelihood of Fleischer comparing Waters's response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing, was high.
Omar Navarro is a Republican candidate who is standing in the election to win the Waters seat in the mid-term elections; he also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's a great thing, if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had "informed the appropriate authorities and agencies of the law of the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the guilty are disclosed," she continued, "and that they are responsible for their actions, which are detrimental and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny English is in Business Again - a parody of Rowan Atkinson's spying with no effect.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new British-targeted film and it appears that this is in this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which involves a parody of action in comic form. He started in 2003 with Johnny English and began hiking again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-satisfaction with the language in the club, regarding how horrendous we are, be a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English has once again obtained a licence with the belly-eyed eye to make a mess of things, and his name suggests that it is a cute character created for those attending the cinema in non-English speaking countries.
It is, of course, the rising secret agent, who thinks he is deceptive, but who resembles Clouseau, a combination of Mr Bean and the one who provided a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is based from the beginning on the traveler and international man, a mystery that Atkinson once took over in Barclaycard TV ads, but which is now forgotten in which he left everything in his wake.
There are a few nice points in this film, the latest JE.
I really enjoyed Johnny English as he walked towards the helicopter while dressed in a medieval knight's coat as the rotors beat against his helmet at one point.
Atkinson's victory for the physical comedy is evident, but the comedy is truly weak and redundant, in particular, because "real" film brands like James Bond and Mission Impossible now produce comedy as part of the films.
It looks like the comedy is aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's woeful unhappiness is not as fresh and focused as the comedy in Mr Bean's form in Atkinson's unsound films.
The real problem is that there is a big problem.
Cyber hackers have slipped into the secret network of British spyware and the names of British agents are leaked. This shocks the on-duty agent- a very small part, unfortunately, for Kevin Eldon.
It's a disaster hit for a prime minister, a serious person, who's under pressure; he's already in full swing: Emma Thompson tries her best with the character, who looks like Teresa-May, but there's not much to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that each spy's name is leaked and she must find someone, who has emerged from it.
And this is Johnny English ineffective. He is employed, at the moment, in a rather elegant place, but he is giving classes, in a secret manner, about how to be a secret agent. Here is some comedy because the offer of English is to provide a Roc-Cheoil-type spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and meets again with his ex-partner, Bough, who was Ben Miller who takes that part again.
Bough is now a married man, married to a commander on a submarine, a small mercenary part, who has an excessive Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who get everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action.They meet Ophelia Bulletova, an attractive, beautiful woman, who was Olga Kurylenko who took the part.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is enthralled by an enticing technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems. Jason Volta is a malicious person and Jake Lacy takes the part.
English and Bough embark on an exhilarating plentiful journey: mounted as waiters, they set fire to a elegant French restaurant; they create a bully raid while on board the elegant yacht of Volta, secretly; English creates an anomaly, when he tries to use a head device of Virtual Reality to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
They do their best for the final paragraph, but while it is cheerful and lively, the whole thing has the appearance of children's television.
enough subject matter.
And as with other Johnny English films, the idea ran with me: can the British film industry get involved with Rowan Atkinson, who suits his potential?
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a four-day working week for British workers but will have to pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which British will work for four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the leaders of the bodies to give money, which they will save through the artificial intelligence (IS) revolution, to the workers in the form of an extra free day.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still have the same pay.
Sources said that ‘fit' the idea for the party's economic program and their plans to change the country in favor of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has agreed to the four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘A review of policy is expected before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but a goal is a four-day working week, which fits the party's approach to giving the worker an advantage and the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree to that idea, given the Green Party's four-day working week during the campaign in the 2017 General Election.
The Labour Party, in general, is not currently agreeing with the target, however.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: ‘The party does not policy a four-day working week and the party is not being considered.'
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference to reflect his vision for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘the lump sum' by utility companies.
Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current separatists in the water bodies will not receive their full share as the Labour government could take ‘deductions', on the matter that something was out of route.
He also confirmed plans to give places to workers on company boards and to create Overarching Ownership Funds and to give employees 10 per cent of the shares in the company, which have a chance of receiving annual dividends of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy states with "60 Minutes" whether or not the FBI's inquiry about Kavanaugh could change their mind.
At least a week's delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been caused by the FBI's inquiry into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, raising the question of the bureau's decision and whether Republican senators could change their mind and remove the Justice's support or not.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday's "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley's correspondent of Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could find any information that would change their mind about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina counterpart had.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"As I enter the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the allegation came out and asked him, ‘Did you do it?'
He was very, very confident, and didn't put a tooth in it."
It seems, however, that Graham's vote is certain.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a serious allegation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who named her can make sure of it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think it will change anything."
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This little Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual event, in which well-known stars are taking part and there is an incredibly important mission, as well: eliminating global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the World Citizen's Festival and thousands of people will be heading to Central Park's Big Green to enjoy musicians like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to highlight the definite aim of the event, that is, to end real poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which began in 2012 and is an international advocacy effort to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are fighting against it.
To receive free tickets for the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) concertgoers have had to perform a number of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or using any other sound means to spread information about their goal to end poverty.
How successful was the Global Citizen and 12 years left to achieve the aim?
Is it really a way to give a free concert as a gift to people to encourage them to take action, or is it another example of a "click" - people thinking they're making a real difference when they sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, The Global Citizen says it has recorded over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who are trying to promote various aims.
It says these actions helped to mobilise global leaders to make promises and promote policies, worth over $37 billion that are set to impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion has been awarded or collected as part of a fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money already received directly affected nearly 649 million people across the globe.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership for investors and people who implement pledges, is based in the UK. It is "dedicated to helping children to develop their resources, according to their ability" and promises to provide a total of $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World Citizens like you, we can end the social injustice that is in malnutrition" Tracy Ullman, the ambassador of the Nutrition Power, told the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken , which called for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a fund for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will help 5 million women and children with fostered intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, who asks the question "why do you think we can end real poverty?
A Global Citizen replied: "There will be a long, difficult road ahead - from time to time, we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and anti-racialism before us, we will succeed, as we are more powerful together.
Musicians taking part in this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to put in place an "exposition" to block Russia's energy exports - Secretary Inland
Washington can use the Navy's "if necessary" to stop Russian energy being for sale in the markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that what Russia is doing in Syria, where it is operating with an invitation from the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be able to settle on energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe, which he has said according to his report.
And, according to the official, there are always ways to deal with it.
"The United States, with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes are kept open, and if necessary, locked in place, to ensure that their energy will not be available in the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the attendees at the event, which was hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance.The Alliance is a non-profit group that calls itself the "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
He continued to make a comparison between Washington's approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is the same.
The economic choice of Iran and Russia is to have, to a large extent, an influence on and change fuels" he said. He referred to Russia as a "one-foot pound" that relied heavily on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump government is on a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump, try to urge Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and, according to Trump, made the Moscow "silence" of Berlin.
Moscow has often stated that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is one economic project costing $11, it will increase the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes it, due to economic reasons and that it is an example of unequal competition.
"I believe we agree on the view that fuel cannot be used as a tool to put pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following his meeting with the US Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
Germany has reaffirmed that it will continue the project.
The main German industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (CTG) has called on the United States to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (CTG) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel and the Russian President, President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully" look at competing for the presidency in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would look "carefully" to compete for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider competing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to put the broken government right and then include a woman in charge," she said according to ‘The Hill'.
"After 6 November, I will look carefully at competing for the presidency."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall, stating that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump's effect on our democracy," she said.
Warren Trump and his nominees for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, have been openly condemned.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "we certainly need an audit from the FBI before we vote."
A poll released on Thursday revealed that a majority of voters in Warren's polling district think she should not compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported her to stand in the election.
The poll showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had more support. 38 percent supported him to stand and 48% were against him.
Among the Democrats, who were in the public debate on standing for the presidency in 2020, were former Vice President, Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (NSI), which is at Track Palin, mobilizing for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Police arrested him on Monday night and charged him with domestic violence incident.
"My own son has been suffering since he came back and I can understand the difficulties that other families face in relation to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. I understand the injury of returning soldiers who are suffering from the disease," she told the audience mobilizing for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin gave "what no one wants to talk about" regarding his arrest and said about their son and other former war soldiers, "they return and they're different, they're tough, they're back and they doubt whether the public appreciates what their fellow soldiers and all the other members of the army have done for their home country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with a domestic violence assault on a woman, for disrupting a report about domestic violence and possessing a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the new asylum policy challenge.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge against the new U.S. policy, which refuses to give asylum to victims, z fleeing from gang-related violence or family violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district complained in a court friend briefing on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker, who was challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name was not mentioned in the lawsuit, Grace Against Sessions, which was initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
She said her party "and violent sons who are members of a gang," abused her but U.S. officials refused to accept her request for asylum on July 20.
She was placed in custody in Texas.
The state attorneys, who supported Grace, said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom are seeking asylum in the United States, were nations that had widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a 2014 decision, made by the Appeal Board of immigrants who allowed undocumented immigrants, who were fleeing from domestic violence, to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy makes "an inconsistency of decades of state law, federal law, and international law."
According to federal law, all claims for asylum must be judged on specific facts and the circumstances of the claim, and the prohibition that exists now interferes with that principle," the briefing of the friend of the court said.
Solicitors further argued that the policy, which banned immigrants, harmed the U.S. economy; they said there was a greater opportunity for them to become entrepreneurs and that "they would provide a necessary workforce."
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered asylum judges to no longer give asylum to victims, who were fleeing from domestic abuse and the violence of the dungeons, in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries, due to harassment or fears of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political views," Sessions said in his statement on the policy on June 11.
It was never meant to solve every problem - even every serious problem - experienced by everyday people around the world.
Despite the strong efforts made in Palu, the number of dead in the race is increasing twice as much as in the race to find survivors.
The story became even more terrible for those who had survived.
"I feel the tension," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her little boy, who had a fever, at an evacuation center in the city of Palu, which had been burned to the ground.
"Every minute a body car patient enters.
There is no clean water."
Settlers were seen returning to their homes, which had been destroyed, while porting through personal items that were wet sunken; they were trying to save anything, which was available,.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which had been destroyed from the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to deal with it.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulder had been broken, let her rest outside the Palu Army Hospital where patients were being treated, because there were still powerful post-traumatic stressors.
He was in tears as he spoke about the terrible earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to save ourselves.
"I feel like I'm being pushed into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family was in the big town for marriage.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then everything was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador adds bullying to China with ‘promotional announcements.
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page announcement in a daily newspaper in the United States, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing that China was using American newspapers to expand propaganda.
On Wednesday last, President Donald Trump referred to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - on which the China Daily paid off - after he accused China of attempting to interfere in the conference elections on November 6. China denies the accusation.
Trump's accusation showed that Beijing was trying to disrupt the U.S. elections a new step in a campaign, which is being enlarged by Washington to put pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common that foreign governments use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are steeped in trade war, which is increasing, at present and, as a result, they have both imposed tariffs on their imports.
China imposed countermeasures tariffs early in the trade war to strike a blow against states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, who exported dozens of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is "using that bullying by putting promotional ads in free American newspapers" Branstad wrote in an article that expressed his views in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
"The Chinese government is using the American tradition that the press has the right of speech and freedom to disseminate its propaganda, when it sends advertisements, for which it pays in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast to that, you won't hear many dissident voices at the news stand down the street here in Beijing. You won't see the different views the Chinese public may have on China's economic policy, which is controversial, because the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He continued: "One of China's major newspapers rejected an offer to publish his article," although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans Put Women Voters Door to Door Before the Mid-Term Elections With Kavanaugh Case, According to Analysts.
As many well-known Republicans stand aside in defending a nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault being made, analysts have warned that there will be a reaction, especially from women during the mid-term elections, which are in the pipeline.
People are very agitated about this and most Republicans have already said that they want to go ahead with a vote.
"These matters cannot be overturned," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told ‘The Hill' for articles published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether there would be enough in Senator Jeff Flake's (Republican-Arizona) effort, who at the last minute tried to get an FBI audit to satisfy angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget it tomorrow and they will never forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning this shout was "November is coming!" with a voice from protesters as they made a demonstration in the Senate hall. The Republicans, who had control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move on to the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony given by Doctor Christine Blasey Ford, reported by Mic. 2.
There will be a remarkably increase in Democratic enthusiasm and it will give them a very lasting encouragement," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, with the news site.
"People are saying it's high, already; it's in the truth.
But it may be higher, especially among women who are between two councils, in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who do not like the President but do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which revealed her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts claimed there could be a reaction, if Republicans continued to advance with him to confirm the nominee.
"This is a risk to the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote or whether or not Kavanagh is appointed on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have dealt with this and the way they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But, it seems that there is a split between Americans, which of the two will believe in the aftermath of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony and a little more of them believe Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe fully or almost completely Ford's evidence and 35 percent of respondents said they believed fully or almost completely Kavanaugh's evidence.
Also, 38 percent of them said they believed, completely or almost completely, that Kavanaugh told lies in his testimony while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure put by Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations brought by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported by the Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her while under the influence of drinking, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee disclosed her genitalia, when they attended a party at the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The person who invented the World Wide Web has plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is set to start a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where they will store their data, and who is allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated, with humor, that the desire behind Inrupt is "global domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the initiative.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to "create a personal data warehouse, online" or create a POD.
It can include contact details, lists of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's about as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all are available at the same time.
The particular thing about the online personal data warehouse is that it is only for the user to give access to a person, who has a specific type of information.
The company gives :"personal capacity through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the Chief Executive, John Bruce, is to provide appropriate resources, process and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers on the team, who have a contract to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said neither he nor his team were talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which their business models of conversions would be inconvenient overnight.
"We're not looking for permission."
In a posting on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission was to provide commercial and ecosystem energy, to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network, which is built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet, when he founded the World Wide Web Curriculum at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, a voice, which has been influential in the debate about the neutrality of the internet, has been in Berners-Lee.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the internet," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: A celebration is held about a clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War 1.
Celebrations have been held in his home town of a clergyman in the Church of England, the only clergyman to have won the Victoria Cross during World War 1 as a fighter.
The award was won by Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But a sergeant killed him four days later and he never knew that he had won the highest award in the British army.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "wonderful symbolism" that the stone would be unveiled 100 years directly after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette on 28 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through heavy fog and under heavy attack from field guns and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of shooters and with "excellent courage" led the line to the front before raiding a field gun alone and setting three of the detachment.
German infantryman killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of World War II.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do but something that goes to the heart in me."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann laid a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt it was "a great honour to take part in the parade" and added that, as well, the support that many people will give has shown a real hero's courage."
IMMA fans stayed seated all night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, they found Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've waited in your seat all night to look at Bellator 206, which is full of bars but you can't look at the main event.
There were 13 fights on the fights list from San Jose, six rounds on the main list and it was shown in a live broadcast through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to fight each other, an audience in the UK was stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people weren't too impressed after they stayed sitting until the early morning to see the fight.
One follower "suggested" the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
"It is a government regulation that the program was not suitable and, therefore, they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, who was in charge of marketing and communications, when questioned about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Muck, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker said they will be doing work on the schedule to provide coverage for future UK audiences.
"I think, when I think about the re-throid we can work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work this out until the time here on Sundays and the time there on Mondays.
But we are trying to fix it.
Believe me, when the program changed over there, there were a lot of texts going sal and back and they weren't all friendly.
We wanted to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a government issue.
I can assure you that it won't happen next time.
We decided to set five rounds rather than six - as we usually do - and tried to provide the trailers with too much and we went too far.
It is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘devastated' due to his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he considered it not as good as others when growing up due to his sexuality- but that encouraged him to make progress.
The 24-year-old says he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "everyone wasn't like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay people's rights to "give hope" to others.
He also said that since he was a parent now it was not so important for him to win in the Olympics.
The show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
While on Laverne's first show as a person on a deserted island, Daley said he viewed himself as "less" than everyone else, when growing up as "it was not socially accepted that boys and girls would like to have sex with one another."
He said: "Until today, those feelings are that I looked at myself as a person who was less and felt different, they are the sure things that have given me the power and strength to be able to achieve things."
He wanted to prove that it was worth ‘something’, he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone, when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics is now a popular campaigner on behalf of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) who has used his presence at this year’s British Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any implication and that he wanted to "give hope" to others.
Daley, who was a three-time world champion, said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year but said there has never been any problem with the gap between the ages.
"When you suffer so much at a very young age" - he went to the Olympics, initially, when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find one of his peers who had so much in the above spell below in his life.
The twins have been parents since June. They have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that "the whole outlook on life" had changed.
"If you asked me last year what was important, it was all about ‘winning a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, things are more important than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, when he was found to have brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the starting row.
"I couldn't tell him ‘you won't be around to be in the first row, Dad,' he said.
"I had a hand in it when it stopped breathing and I didn't admit it wasn't conclusive until it stopped breathing and it was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that was the dream I had during my life - diving in front of a town crowd at the Olympics, there couldn't be a better feeling," he said.
He inspired his first selection of songs, as well - Proud with Heather Small - which impressed him in the preparations for the Olympics and still scares him off.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not performing properly on the representative bench in the Ryder Cup was placed on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will have reached the top spot on Sunday when he will play in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but will have to improve on their playing if he doesn't want it to be an unpleasant occasion for him.
Jim Furyk, captain, sent Mickelson to the bench of representatives for four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday, while Mickelson played in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, a summit segment.
Despite being in the middle of the playoffs, as he often used to be for the United States, Mickelson, who had won five major championships, shared his time as a recommended cheerleader and practiced his playing on the field in the hopes that he could solve whatever problem was bothering him.
He was never able to hit the ball directly, even when he was in the top of his field, the 48-year-old player is not all fit for a narrow Le Golf National course, as the long-distance rough puts off, on a regular basis, for stray-going beats.
And if the course itself is not difficult enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will compete with the round-robin British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, whose first year of playing is Tommy Fleetwood, a partner who has won all four matches this week.
If the Americans have a good start, which is four points to a close at the start of the 12 singles games, Mickelson's game may be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he trusted him, but he couldn't say much else.
"He fully understood the part he played here today, praised me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He is a person who has gained a lot of fame in the past, and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and for this week.
I probably didn't think of it as a two-piece.
I dreamed more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we were going to move.
He wants to be out like everyone else.
Mickelson will overtake Nick Faldo's try for the one who played the most matches on Sunday.
He could end up pointing out a field that was never as good as his personal try.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and seven shared, although Furyk said there were some intangibles for the team because of his existence.
"He's funny, sociable, he likes to get out of people and he's a great person in the staff room," he explained.
"I think the young players really enjoyed the sport of being teased, too, this week, which it was funny to see.
It provides more than the play."
Thomas Bjorn understands that a large surplus can quickly go away.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from his own experience that a good surplus at the start of the last day of the singles matches in the Ryder Cup can create a difficult day.
The Danish played for the first time in a 1997 game at Valderrama, where under their captain, Seve Ballesteros scored five points ahead of the Americans but barely won with the smallest gap between them, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great surplus at Valderrama; we had a great surplus at Brookline, where we lost and Valderrama, where we won, but barely," says Bjorn, who is pictured after watching Rang 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to be ahead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the history will tell me and everyone that this is not about.
The first part of the morning.
Go out and do the right things.
This is not about the points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this horn, and the focus will remain there.
"I've already said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our team, but we know well who's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn was delighted about the way in which his players played and said: "I wouldn't read too much into it.
Another day is tomorrow.
Tomorrow is about how each individual player creates and there is something different to do there.
It's great to be out there with a partner, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then take a full test of your potential as a golfer.
That's the message you have to apply to the players, that is play on top of your abilities tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and those play at the top of his ability, too."
In opposition to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will be there urging his players to be able to play better as individual players than they played with their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won by three points out of four points.
Furyk has experienced both the results of a major change on the last day before he was a member of the winning team at Brookline and then a member of the losing team, when Europe achieved the "Mirror at Medinah".
"I remember every word of it," he said in response when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he incited his players at the beginning of the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow but you want to start well as you saw at Brookline and at Medinah.
When that energy goes on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the games in the middle of members.
"We're going to have to get out of the way, and we're going to have to make some changes tomorrow, you know, to make sure we're doing the right thing."
Thomas is tasked with showing resilience and Rory McIlroy is against him in the main game and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the first half of the day.
"I went with this group of men because I think they'll be good for the whole day," Bjorn said of her choices for the singles matches.
The German warship is again withdrawn.
The newest German Navy frigate to replace the warships from the Cold War era should have been commissioned in 2014, but it will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, reported by local media.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz," the presiding ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesman mentioned.
The ship should have been part of the Navy in 2014 , but there have been major post-delivery problems that have seriously hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen frigate.
It has been suggested that they will contain a mass-powered canon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as disintegration technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the newest frigates for two years away from home ports.
But, because there was a constant delay, it means that the pioneering warships - which would allow the demonstration of power abroad - will be out of date by the time they are ready, says Die Zeit.
The frigate was unhappy in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the builder after it was accepted.
Not much was known about the reasons why they sent the ship back, but German media cited some "software and hardware flaws" if it were not deployed on a combat mission.
Deficits in the software were extremely important because Baden-Wuerttemberg-type vessels will be operated by a team of 120 sailors - half of the crew were on older Bremen-type frigates.
Also, it became clear that the ship is far too heavy, that this reduces the operation of the ship and limits the Navy's capacity to upgrade in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", which weighs 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
With the exception of defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the cost of staff training - is becoming controversial.
The cost is said to have been increased to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6) -increased from its initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the newest frog are very important due to the recent warnings that the power of the German fleet is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was "running off ships that can be evacuated."
The official said the issue had increased over the years because old ships were decommissioned but not replaced by new ships.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's type frigates were able to form part of the Navy.
The National Trust is backing a hearing on the secret life of the bat.
New research is underway on an estate in the Scottish Highlands and aims to find out how the bat uses the countryside to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the unique flight mammal behavior and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The scientists' study at the Scottish National Trust will follow common bats and soprano pipistreles, as well as Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at special locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bats during the season.
The National Health Service (NSS) team will conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An audio analysis of each record, conducted by experts, will find out the frequency of calls made by bats and what each particular species does.
A habitat map and then a report to show a record of their behaviour will be made in a large picture of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor to the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the findings will reveal the most important habitat areas for the bats and the way in which they are used by all of the species.
This knowledge will help to demonstrate the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve woodland for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by buildings and development work that disrupts their fodder and lost habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can be dangerous where building materials are subjected to pulp and some chemical treatments, as well as attacks carried out by cat pets.
They're not blind, actually.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when they catch prey material.
They find insects and obstacles in their flight paths from echoes, a sophisticated technique.
The Scottish National Trust, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very real about the bats.
He has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect fences and, sometimes, rescue.
The organization has established a separate sanctuary for bats, the first and only one in Scotland, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says that the estate is the best district for them.
"We have an amazing area for bats here at Threave," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we do here and at other estates will help us understand what they want so that they can thrive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats, before maintenance is carried out on buildings and residences, as if only maternity wings were destroyed, it could kill up to 400 female bats, young bats and, possibly all the bats in that area.
Bats are protected and it is against the law to kill, disturb, agitate or destroy their foes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Wing Conservation Trust, is ironing out the public's help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and, for many of our species, we don't know how the whole communities are doing.
Ronaldo denies the rape he was accused of as lawyers are about to put the law on a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been baptized as a "conscience," stating that people want to "publicize themselves" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are about to take a legal case against a German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then gave her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video with his fans several hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo attacked the reports and called them "confessionalism."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, it's a lie," said the person who won the Ballon d'Or five times while speaking into the camera.
‘They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous, when they mention my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," said the player and smiling at him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take a legal case against Der Spiegel about the allegations. they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would seek compensation for "damages, at a level consistent with the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident is alleged to have occurred in June 2009 at a switzerland in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Following a meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have gone back to the player's room where he raped her, which is claimed, according to papers filed at the County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he said he was "99 percent" well but that the "one percent" let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that they both had sex but that it was consensual sex.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and taken photographs of her injuries at a hospital but that she had agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of revenge" and feared "that she would be disgraced in front of the public."
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the arrangement as she is, at all times, very upset about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged incident occurred, and this summer, he moved to a huge club, Juve, in an arrangement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would be ‘forever regretted' if it lost car manufacturers.
The UK would be ‘forever regretted' if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit automobile manufacturing, according to Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
He said it was "a cause of concern" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left EEC unresolved, it would stop car production at its factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We have a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said that jobs could be lost, if there were a delay at the border, in the event of no solution under Brexit.
Burnaston's factory - manufactured by the Toyota Auris and Avensis - made almost 150,000 cars last year and 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union unresolved at the end of March, car production at our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers have said they are concerned about an unresolved EU exit in relation to the way in which cross-border trade will operate; among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks posed by supply chains in the event of an unresolved Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just on time" basis. Parts come from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for an order-made car.
If the UK leaves without a solution on 29 March, the border could have disruptions, and could lead to delays and shortages of parts, the industry says.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan "has been made out accurately to avoid delays like this at the border."
"We need a solution. We want to have the best solution, not only that will allow our current success to continue, but that we will take this opportunity," he told the BBC.
"Our evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue the supply chains, which are very successful at the moment."
Toyota was unable to say for how long the production would be in full stoppage, but in the long run, it said that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and, eventually, the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is an organizer for Unite's trade union in the factory, said that his members' concerns were increasing more. "In my experience when these positions disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have provided a plan, accurate and reliable, for the future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and the White House may be delayed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with the deputy Attorney General could be "delayed for another week" as the fight under the nominee for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of a special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is exploring Russia's interference in the election, relations between Trump's special assistants and the possibility that a barrier to justice had been formed by the president.
Whether or not Trump will break the vice-chairmanship and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence is the backlash that has been heard in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed throwing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility that the president could be removed by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the description.
But he went to the White House this past Monday and the out-of-state story that he was about to resign from his job.
In exchange for that it was announced that there would be a meeting on Thursday with Trump who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed in order not to contradict the Senate committee hearing of the judges in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long inquiry into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's holistic hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There is no set date for it yet, it could be held this week but I could imagine it being postponed another week of all the things that are going on in the supreme court.
We will see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
There are some reporters who wouldn't agree with that statement: Sanders didn't have a press briefing from September 10.
The host of the programme, Chris Wallace, asked her why this was the case.
Sanders said the briefings were scarce because he didn't like that TV reporters would be "making gags," although she said: "I wouldn't deny that they're making gags."
She then suggested that Trump and the press would have more direct contacts.
"The president has more question and answer sessions than any previous president," she said but did not mention any evidence about that. "We looked at those figures."
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States that will be a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do that often over the past few weeks and that will be put in place a press briefing where you'll be able to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions while leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences along with well-known visitors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have revealed the reason in New York this week when he met with a bunch of reporters in an unrestricted way that was sometimes strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers at NHS Scotland to thank the country and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament Member, Jeane Freeman, launched a letter with less than six months remaining until the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the cost of applications for status as settlers by EU citizens working in public devolved services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: Negotiations were underway between the UK and the EU on Britain's departure, and a decision is expected to be made in the autumn.
But the UK government is adding to their preparations for an event without any arrangement that could happen.
I know that this story is very upsetting to all of you.
That is why I want to express my appreciation for the work of all staff regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
It's definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christening of Abercrombie, when he fell to his knees.
Mike Organ of the Tennesseans reported a crisis surgery on Tennessee State Tigers line supporter Christion Abercrombie when his head was injured when the Vanderbilt Commodores beat them 31-27.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred to him a short time before half time.
"He came to the sideline and fell from a fist," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the line side before putting him on a stretcher and postponed him to further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been taken from the laboratory at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said "no information is available about the type/size of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redshirt sofa and this is his first season playing with Tennessee State after his move from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before leaving the game making him a total of 18 tackles during the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign merchants will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy properties in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people in line with the Tory plans.
The plan will detract from the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to
The stamp duty will be charged to those who are not paying tax in the UK
Exchequer estimates £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce a higher rate of stamp duty on foreign merchants when they buy properties in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan will be seen as an attempt to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty will be applied to people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK and the extra money will be used to accelerate the Government's efforts to deal with people living outside.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and properties purchased for rent - could be as high as three per cent.
The Exchequer estimates that it could raise up to £120 million a year.
People who do not live in the UK are estimated to buy 13 percent of the newly built London apartments which increases prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first residence.
Many of the country's hazardous areas - especially in the capital - are shaded due to the high number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan came several weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty to help more young people to have their first residence.
He accused large construction companies of keeping high residence prices by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to solve Britain's "lively disgrace" of "housing."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of prominent housing recommendations including rent control and the elimination of faultless people being sent out.
He wants to give more powers to build new housing councils.
Mrs May said: I said last year that my aim during my prime ministership would be to re-awaken the vision of Britain - that every new generation should have a better life.
This includes re-purposing the market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
It shouldn't be as easy for people who don't live in the UK, and companies based abroad to buy homes as easy as British residents who work hard.
It's a dream come true for a lot of people, it's a dream to have their own residences and it's an insult to how many people go to sleep outside."
Jack Ross: "My last wish is to be the manager of Scotland."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, said his last wish was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Jack is a 42-year-old Scotsman who is enjoying his re-live of the North East club and is in third place in the First League, three points from the top.
He moved with him to State of the Light during the summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
When I was in my teens, I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a B cap and that was what." said Ross on Sportsbound BBC Scotland.
"But when I was growing up my dad and I were watching Scotland playing at Hampden and it's always been my attraction back.
I won't have that opportunity unless I'm successful as a club manager."
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were previous managers of the Sunderland team.
Ross had previously led Alloa Athletic and said that he had no concerns to succeed such a well-known man at a major club and that he had rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My current measurement rod in terms of success is this club that put me back in the Main Series.
"There is no doubt that the club's structure and axes make up for it, but it should be in the Premier League," he said.
It's an easy task but I wouldn't say I'm successful if I don't get it back then."
Ross has only spent three years as manager, with Dumbarton as assistant head coach and 15 months on Harts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa to recover from how they were placed in the third tier and made such a transformation to St Mirren that they were at risk of disqualification that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than if he felt while playing with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably the time of the nations," he said, referring to taking control of Alloa.
"I really believed that a job as a manager is the right job for me rather than a job as a player.
That may seem strange when I say it but I've been pretty good, I've had a decent entry and I've enjoyed some relatively high highlights.
But sometimes the life of the player can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do in a week.
I have a passion for the arts and crafts, but I feel like my life is in the hands of the world.
I've always wanted to be a manager and since I have that job now my mind is more relaxed than it has been since I came of age."

5:30 pm The perfect time for a pint according to a survey
The summer heat wave is contributing to the influx of British pubs that were struggling but putting extra pressure on shared chains.
The figures showed that pub admissions increased by 2.7 per cent but that 4.8 per cent of all pubs declined.
Peter Martin from business consultancy CGA who compiled the figures said: "The result of England's July engagement in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected was that the July patronage continued when pubs' revenues were 2.8 percent higher but that the sharings were even more severe.
The share trade declined by 1.8 per cent in June and the situation was even worse in July.
Taverns and bars that focused on drinking became much better and had replica fragments with a worse-off replica.
The heat of the sun caused the pubs to focus on food matters but it did not have as dramatic an impact on the partisans.
People just don't want to go out and drink.
During the month, sales of managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent and food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman from RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts said: "These results have shown the trends we are seeing since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major sporting and social events are the main factors for sales in the market outside the home.
Not surprisingly, partisanship groups are constantly struggling, and it will be very difficult for them to accept a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in addition to their ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we will see if the lower temperatures we had in August will give them relief that they need.
Overall growth of 2.7 percent in July came on pubs and sharing houses, including newly opened places, reflecting the coming delay in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the pub, bar and sharing sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a combined turnover of over £9 thousand and Coffer Peach Tracker serves as the industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account while hiding from their parents.
A survey showed that one in five children - some 11-year-olds - have a secret social media account and keep them hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that fake "insta" pages had grown.
This raises the question of whether people are interested in
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they have a "main account" that they display to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey conducted on 20,000 secondary school students showed that fake "insta" pages had grown - a reference to an instagram photo exchange site.
This raises the question of people's willingness to share information.
Twenty percent of students said they have cleared a ‘main account' to display to their parents and also have a private account.
A mother accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter where a teenager was urging others to "force me".
The research conducted by bDigital Awareness UK and the Conference of Principals of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and that those who had had private accounts were admitted to them.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "How so many teenagers are being attracted to creating online spaces is a cause for concern where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will serve as the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the governing board's annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's top award athlete in field and field and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is forever valued by Scottish, UK and world sportspeople and we are sure it will go a long way to resolving athletic matters in Scotland," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can make my own share in leading the sport in Scotland."

There are conflicting opinions online about an advertisement that mothers who are consuming milk compare to cows.
A company that offers their advertised breast pumps has an online stimulus controversy in which women who breastfeed a child are compared to cows who are being harassed.
On the occasion of the launch of the "world's first breast-portable pump" technology company Elvie launched a semi-real music-inspired announcement to demonstrate the freedom the pump offers to mothers who are milk-producing.
There were four mothers dancing in a barn full of grass while singing lyrics like: "Yes, I make myself strong but you don't see any tail" and "In case you didn't notice it these are only my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump them out, pump them out, I'm feeding these children." "Pump them out, pump them out, I'm sucking my women."
The announcement was published on the company's Facebook page and sparked controversy online.
77,000 people watched it and hundreds of people were referred to it, many of whom commented that he ignored the "horrible aspects" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product," one wrote.
"We're like ours in that they need to have a calf to suck milk, but in the case of those who have stolen their children from them a few days after birth."
Elvie's breast pump can be placed neatly within a tight trough (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "It's obviously a traumatic thing for mother and child.
"Yes, but why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another wrote: "Such a warning. It was cut off from the world."
Others defended the announcement and one woman admitted that she considered the song to be very funny forever.
"I think it's a wonderful plan.
I'd still have some milk.
I just felt like a cow when the pumping was going on.
It's a bit of a mess, but I took it on my own terms.
"This product was designed by someone else," he said.
Another person had this reference: This is a comedy advertisement aimed at mothers who are pumping (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "ba".
This is not an announcement advocating or criticizing the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the women suggest that they were dancing and the pumps secretly pressed into their ends.
The campaign is based on the perception that a lot of women who pump their boobs think they feel like cows.
The entire Elvie Pump is quiet, does not have wires or tubes, sits discreetly within a sewage trough so that women are able to move around, keep their children in their hands and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and is involved in early childhood development at Mother: Elvie's Pump is so revolutionary that it earned a naughty, exciting launch.
When we showed the relationship between naughty women and dairy cattle we wanted to draw attention to breast satiety and all its challenges, and to demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump and to do so on an entertaining bee that people could be talking about.
This wasn't the first time Elvis had been in the news.

Hundreds of Migrants Quietly Arrived at a pub on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children who have been arrested has been greatly increased even though the number of people crossing the border has changed little, as Trump’s strict policies and hard talk have now made it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
What happened in the past is that the migrants were sponsored by undocumented migrants but are now afraid that they will endanger their ability to remain in the country by applying to sponsor a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that people wishing to become sponsors and adults would have to finger the fingerprints of their family and that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence who is a senior officer with the Immigration and Customs Authority indicated before Congress last week that the agency had arrested scores of people who had submitted to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later revealed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors, or who are members of sponsor households, are illegal in this country, and a large share of them are criminal aliens.
For that reason we are always in search of those people," said Mr. Albence.
While trying to process the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that will require some to come before a court within one month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which, in the opinion of homeless workers, was a standard period in the past.
Many of them will present themselves through videoconferencing rather than in-person, to demand an immigration judge to obtain legal status.
Those who are met that are not eligible for relief will be quickly expelled from the country.
Refugee workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months indicate that while children are in detention, they are more likely to experience anxiety or depression resulting in violent incidents or escape attempts.
Supporters said these concerns are added to larger facilities such as Tornillo which is so large that it will not be seen that a child is struggling.
They also said that if children are moved to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally, or to say goodbye to their friends, that could contribute to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria orders ‘for arrest' of American, French and Turkish forces to clear them from the country immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite this being the eighth year that war is taking place in that country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has declared that the foreign forces in Syria are illegal and excused that they are fighting against terrorism, and will be "treated accordingly."
"They must leave immediately without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem declared "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes.
He added that Damascus would continue to "bring the holy war to an end until we clear up" terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign force from all the territories of Syria."
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria as they provide training and advice mainly to the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in that country who have been destroyed by warfare.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for their return and blamed "some western countries" who are "dispersing unreasonable concerns" encouraging refugees to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are making a political question for a problem that should be dealt with as a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement by Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey ensured that Russian-backed Syrian forces will not invade the province with three million people.
However, Moualem stressed how the agreement has "clear goals of time" and said that he hoped that during the fighting he would focus on jewelers including the Nusra Front fighters who have a connection with Al-Quaeda and "will be destroyed."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting of the new committee soon consisting of representatives of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria for the time being to end the war and as preparations for elections to be held.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the committee's work must be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and fulfilled people not to mention it.

Money laundering coming into the mid-term elections is the toughest ever for the House of Representatives.
Not surprisingly, a silver flood has been pouring into Pennsylvania's 17 districts since a new layout of the conference districts was added so that two elected members compete for the same seat.
A new frontier for the Pittsburg suburban area has been designed in such a way that Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another area in a special election this past spring
against current Republican member Keith Rothfus who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's former 12 district which largely overlaps new district 17.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were laid out unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district initiated a round of heavy blows between the party's main funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name is in the public domain in Pennsylvania after winning a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March that was watched by a lot of people.
The Republican had held the seat for over a decade and President Trump won the area with 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are a little bit ahead.
Sam had been thinking about punishing El Salvador because of support for China but withdrew from it.
Diplomats noted that Beijing was recognized by the Dominican Republic and Panama and that Washington did not do much about it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela Phanama in July 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners ordered Trump Organization management to leave.
Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman said in a statement that value this month was that State Department officials decided to call back American diplomatic mission leaders from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions made not to recognize Taiwan anymore."
But no one was thought to be penalised except for the Salvadoran who received $140 million in aid in 2017 from America, including drug control aid as well as development and economic support.
Among the penalties being proposed were cuts to financial assistance, targeted visa restrictions that would severely disrupt this country in Central America with high rates of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings went on, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to continue from a similar meeting held last year and was considered a breakthrough in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But senior officials of the administration indicated before mid-September that they wished the conference to go ahead which ended any plan to impose penalties on the Salvadorans.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to speak at the conference to be held in mid-November and diplomats say that shows that the administration considers the meeting very important.
And the three American delegates quietly returned to the Salvadoran, Panamanian and Dominican Republic with no harsh messages about punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to speak about the details of the controversy but three American officials including two diplomats described them on condition that their names would not be mentioned.

History Studies
The next hit may be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on how Mr. Trump may have blocked justice and there's a lot of evidence in the public record about that.
There are reports in the surroundings that Mr. Mueller is also focusing on seeing whether Mr. Trump has been working in solidarity with Russia in the attack they carried out on our elections.
If another party gets the lead in the U.S. Congress, Mr. Trump may have to provide an account of what he did before that sort of thing just when he's going to go before the voters and possibly before the jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty and I don't want to suggest that it's inevitable that Mr. Trump will be overthrown or anyone like him in Europe.

The course of history revolves around such points and will be delayed or accelerated in movement for the cessation of democracy.
America has dealt with a lot of these issues.
What do we do if Mr. Trump gives a stick and a road to Deputy High Commissioner Rod Rosenstein, the man who governs the fate of Mr. Mueller's inquiry?
Rosenstein was in trouble since there was a report in this newspaper last year that he was recording the president under wraps and revealed comments that it was not suitable for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
"What we will say if it is found that the F.B.I.'s recent inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh will be complete or fair - or if he is reaffirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite plausible allegations that he has sexually assaulted and given dishonest evidence.
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the U.S. Congress that will ensure that Mr. Trump has to account for what he has done?
If we fail to do so, we will have a long-term impact on democracy.

Graham Dorrans in the match against Vienna
Rangers will be hosts when they play against Rapid Vienna on Thursday. Rangers were very successful when they finished on a combined scorer against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they win on Rapid Vienna they will be prone to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
He suffered a knee injury to Graham Dorrans and was unable to play his first game this season until the game against Villarreal which ended on a combined score of 2-2. However, he believes Rangers can take advantage of that result to achieve better things.
"That's what we're good at because they're a fine Villarreal team," said 31-year-old Graham.
"We went to the game and hoped to get an advantage from it and we got a point.
We may be able to get the win at the end but, overall, finishing on a combined score was a good result.
They were probably more male in the first half but we improved in the second half and we were better than them.
It's going to be a big European night.
I hope we get through to three points just to get a hard game that will be there because they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I'm sure we can push forward and get a positive result.
We definitely had a hard year last year, with the injuries that have happened to me and the changes that have happened in the club itself but we think everything is fine now.
The scuads are good and the boys are enjoying very much; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, we can put this season behind us and have a chance to win."
Women who fall asleep during the night due to a lack of sleep
Despite the fact that the people who took part in the survey had a clear view of how they wished to be cared for, many did not speak to their family members about the situation.
About half of those who took part in a Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them but they're not doing anything to talk to them about it," said Holly Snyder, who is the vice president of Nationwide life insurance business.
This is the place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children, you cannot prepare your children to provide care unless you tell them much in advance what you need.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as these could have a significant impact on the cost.
Tell your financial adviser to give you advice: The adviser can advise you on ways to pay for these costs.
Options for long-term care may include: a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a money-worth hybrid policy to help you meet these costs, or providing self-insurance for your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Confirm your legal documents: Avoid legal cases before they start.
A health care professional will be able to act on your behalf so that you can appoint someone you trust to look after your medical care and ensure that professionals meet what you need in case you are unable to communicate.
Think about giving someone power of attorney in relation to your money matters.
You should choose someone you trust to make money decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are left disabled.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine for yourself that your elderly parent has a medical crisis and is on their way to hospital.

The victim did not see who had attacked him.
He did not risk death for the injuries he suffered and the police asked witnesses to speak to them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials at least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday and the number of dead is expected to increase.
The communication systems have been destroyed and relief officers are unable to obtain any information from the superintendent of Donggala, located north of Palu and closer to the episode of the earthquake which had a strength of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, it is located at the end of a narrow bay on the east coast of the islands of Sulawesi and was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The 40th anniversary of the city was celebrated when the earthquake and tsunami struck it.
Donggala is a subdivision that extends over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast on the northwest of the islands of Sulawesi.
Leasehold is an administrative region of less than a province and was estimated at 299,200 people in 2017.
The Central Sulawesi economy is largely dependent on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but most of it is done in Morowali on the other coast beyond Sulawesi.
The earthquakes and tsunamis of Palu and Donggala have met frequently in the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938 a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, he was hit by a tsunami and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring seismic area and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake occurred on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December that triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast and half of those died in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 occurred south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, prompting tsunamis to break into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a strength of 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.

Sarah Palin's son, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of being guilty of domestic violence, interfering with sending a report about domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took his phone from her.
According to a report from KTUU Palin has been deferred to Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility while being detained on an unsecured $500 bond.
According to the network when he appeared before a court on Saturday and when asked what he was pleading he responded "innocently, certainly convincingly".
Palin has been accused of three class A misdemeanors which means he could be sentenced to up to a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor which means he could be sentenced to a day in prison together with and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
He was charged in December 2017 with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with reporting a crime under domestic violence, possessing a weapon while under the influence of substance in relation to the incident.
He claimed that he had stabbed her in the back.
Former militant groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 for suggesting her son's violent behaviour had resulted from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of dead due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people are dead due to an earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5 and triggered tsunamis that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication systems have been put off and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a short distance from the center of Sulawesi which is to the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos being sent on social media showing the moment the ground began to tremble.
The first people gathered for a beachside festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke into them.
The death penalty is demanded by Federal prosecutors.
Federal prosecutors are calling for Sayfullo Saipov to be sentenced to death who is suspected to have been the victim of the terrorist attack in which eight people were killed, a rare penalty that has not been imposed on anyone in the state due to a federalist crime since 1953.
It is alleged that a 30-year-old Saipov who rented a Home Depot truck used to attack a bike range along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and crushed previous pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty, filed in the South District of New York.
Both of these charges are accompanied by a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal high jury accused Saipov in 22 charges that included eight charges of murder for the benefit of arsonists, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said they wanted "a lot of planning and planning" for the attack and said Saipov did it in a "sweet, cruel and brutal" way.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," detailed in the confidential notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time the South District of New York has prosecuted a death sentence.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug providers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was completed in a federal case in New York was 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was encouraged to do the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called for the flag of ISIS to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-charge indictment
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov said "they are obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"For us the decision to seek the death sentence rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment birth without any possibility of allowing the trauma of such proceedings to be extended for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death sentence
A Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘move the people's army' today while protesting at the Tory conference.
A former Ukip leader said politicians needed to be under pressure from Eurosceptics - and one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK would now "get away" if Mr Farage were Britain's Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May is highlighted as she seeks to bring her party's split family together and Torys for Remain after taking part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the prime minister to keep his Chequers conciliation plan on the right track while attacking Brexit supporters, Waiting supporters and the EU.
Her supporters confirmed that she will continue to seek a deal with Brussels despite the counter-reactions - and that she will force Eurosceptics to choose between her own package and a ‘bowl rule'.
Mr. Bone said at the mobilisation Event in Solihull means that he wanted to throw ‘Chequers out'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be paired up and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he were in charge, we would be gone now,’ he said.
MEP Wellingborough also said: ‘I will stand for Brexit but we need to throw out Chequers.’
Explaining the reasons why he opposes the EU, he said: ‘We have not fought global wars to make us obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds is that they are trying to stay false out loud.'
The Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins who was also present at the march, told reporters: ‘I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition is not to vote for him, neither are the supporters of our party nor our activists who walk in the streets and get us votes in the first place.
I want you to throw out Chequers and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: ‘The prime ministers keep their positions when they add to their word.'
Mr Farage said at the mobilisation that politicians needed to be ‘pushed’ if they were about to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a matter of interim confidence - the people -- and our political class,' he said.
‘They are trying to abandon Brexit and we are here today to say to them ‘we will not let you do that'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he also said: ‘I wish you to put pressure on our political class, who are about to abandon Brexit.
‘We are going to send away the army of people in this country who have given us victory in Brexit and we will not allow our rest to be an independent, autonomous, proud UK.’
Meanwhile, Waiting supporters marched through Birmingham before running a two-hour mobilization in the city centre.
There have been a number of protests against the ban after the group was launched this weekend.
The pair from Lord Adonis' Labour were joking about the Conservatives for their security difficulties with a party application when starting the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT systems as well as all the technology for Canada and more, for a confrontational border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
‘Similar to idioms.
There is no such thing as a good time and a good time," he said.
Warren intends to ‘look sharply' at a position in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he is to "look closely at a position in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is standing for election again in November against Republican state Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She said she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting she had with electors and the format of the town hall meeting being used since Trump began his term of office.
One of the attendees asked her if she intended to stand in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman at the top."
One person arrested after Sims's death was released from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a person suspected of the basketball player's dead release from LSU Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a conference at 11a.m. E.T.
They released a video of the release on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was released and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot wound to the head and died because of it," police leader Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and was released by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the crime scene, that he had an army, and admitted that he had released Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without difficulty and brought into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and his average per game was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after the team orders him to be awarded the win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and little did he leave Hamilton on the empty beach after he had defended his place in the first two rounds and had invited Vettel to attack each other's teams.
Vettel first entered the shafts and left Hamilton he met the traffic at the back of the pack, something that was right that would have a big impact on affairs.
The Mercedes went to the stop only one circuit shafts later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel activity after the Ferrari driver had left the inside free reluctantly and the risk of standing the stead after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then dominated for a large part of the race while keeping hold of his bases to concentrate on fast territory and passing Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the shafts on the 44th circuit but was unable to increase his speed in the other eight circuits while Raikkonen was building the fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri tried it all weekend and it was sir in that it let me over.
The team has done an excellent job and one-two of them," Hamilton said.
There was a horrendous body
President Donald Trump was joking about Senator Dianne Feinstein mobilizing on Saturday after she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which the nominee for Supreme Court was accused of sexual assault Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a mobilisation in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss the evidence Ford brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but rather said that what was going on in the Senate had shown people to be "beautiful and ugly and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mischievous and ugly and false," he said.
"When you look at stories about releases and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you read it?
Remember his reply... you leaked his document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, not a spade.
I didn't sneeze."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No
A letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the allegations at Kavanaugh at Ford back in July, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his own office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't divulge his story," Feinstein told the committee, reported in The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it under wraps and I kept it secret as she asked."
But the president seemed not to accept his denial, saying during a Saturday night mobilization: "I tell you the truth, that was a terrible physical sign.
"Maybe that's just the best performance I've ever seen."
"Continuing to defend the nominee to the Supreme Court, for which three women have been accused of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on their own.
"They're set to take back power, no matter which way they do it.
You see the solitude, the granularity, no matter who they hurt, who they have to put under their feet to gain power and control," the president said in a Mediaite report.
High quality: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two backs for the Giants against Dundee
A sufficient act in the loss made in the First-tier on Friday against Belfast Giants by securing the win in the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were ahead by two early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to co-scor before Dwyer put the Giants ahead again.
Francois Bouchard scored a joint goal for Dundee before he had the win after two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Top-tier for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the sides, and the Giants secured the win in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first back came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the second back for the team four minutes later.
During a very busy start period, Sullivan took the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the combined score to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead before the first break before scoring his second back of the night at the end of the first period.
The town side reorganized themselves and Bouchard once again scored a combined goal with the back of a mass attack at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the match last in the second period and made sure they would win with their team's fifth semi-final back through the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four out of the last five games, will play against Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Gets Death to Make Sure the First Person on a Flight Can Escape from a Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is said to be a hero after his death as he ensured that an airplane that had hundreds of people on the ground arrived safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday prompting a tsunami.
The area is still being hit by strong aftershocks and many people stranded in the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues had fled with their soul, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly shaken control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He then waited to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely erect enclosures.
Then he jumped from a control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported in Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we missed it the morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken and we hear about this," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that there may be thousands of dead and the country's disaster mitigation agency saying there is a border on entrance to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead is still estimated to be increasing as many bodies were still under the debris as enough could not be reached," Sutopo agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho said.
Palu is destroyed by waves that reached up to six meters and a mass burial will then take place on Sunday.
Army and business aircraft are taking in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance takes in a body.
There is no clean water.
Small businesses are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Association in Indonesia told CNN: "The Red Cross Association in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but they don't know what they'll find there.
It's still there, but it could be a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to do all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after a plane crash in Lahore
The airliner operating a flight that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia says one man is missing, having earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew members departed safely from the immersed plane.
Air Niugini said in an issue that from the afternoon on Saturday there was no finding of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, a hospital and investigators while trying to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what was responsible for the crash and what exactly happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane entered very low.
"That's great," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to go sparingly through water to the escape routes on the immersed plane.
He said he had been snoring and screaming, and that he had been snoring in the back of his head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby helped improve the rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people to a beach before the plane dived into about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in crashes at registered airlines with PNG over the last twenty years but none have been involved in Air Niugini.
An analyst sets out the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutors had made their case on Saturday in a men's retrial accused of burning women out of Mississippi alive in 2014.
The Analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for the long hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone records to compile a story about the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received replacement data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which went against what he previously claimed, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford went up on the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not at home that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth while he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misconception was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about a fortnight before she died.
The mobile phone records gave the impression that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
"He wiped it from his life," Hale said.
It has been speculated that the defense will close its arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?

The High Breed out of Bristol, argues that hip hap has moved away from its origins as there have been political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and have affection for a conscious hip hap again.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have once again emerged in the UK by weighing musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blue person?!
Childminders in NY put the law on a couple after being given a stick and a road to her due to a "racial" text message
A child in New York City has been charged with discriminatory dismissal by a couple after she received a misleading text message from the mother in which she complained that she was "another blue person."
The couple denies that they are racist, and they put the case of law in comparison to extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two disappointed when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she came for her first working day in 2016.
"Oh my God, OTHER BLUE MAN," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
After realizing that she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman as she was uncomfortable, gave Ms Maurice a stick and a road, saying that her caretaker had done a bad job and was African-American and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for the work day she did and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is putting the law on the couple for dismissing her from her job, and she is seeking compensation equal to $350 a day for the residential postcard, six-months for which she was hired, although she was not given a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday, while also saying "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have reacted to the assertion that they are racist, stating that ending Maurice's employment was a decent thing, and fearing that they could not trust them after interfering with her.
My wife told me something she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Do you want to take care of someone you've been rude to, even if you've made it through a mistake?
Your new-born baby?
Listen to it now!"
Plasco compared the legal case to "splitting" while saying that his wife was expecting a baby in two months' time and that she was "in trouble."
"You're going to find someone like that?
That's not a good thing," said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public did not hesitate to criticize the couple on social media, and they were past them because of their behavior and logic.
In a new letter, Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not understand a spoken word.
The daughter of Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter who was born soon after the book was accepted, under the letter, said: "It's hard to imagine that you were someone who was first reading it before it was published."
It's funny now that we know that Paddington's success has come a long way."
While saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman with BBC before he was encouraged by a small teddy bear to write a book for children, would be positive although his work was rejected, she also said that the celebration of the book's 60th anniversary was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as "a very important family member," she said her father was proud of her success in the end without being ridiculous about it.
"He was a man, and he was on his own," she said.
"But since Paddington was like a real man to him, it was almost like having a child who does well: you're proud of an essay even though you didn't do the heroine.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Even though he created and dreamed of it, he always gave Paddington the recognition of himself."
My daughter was dying and I was safe on the phone.
After landing her daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked for free to save her life.
"Nad was calling me regularly to say that it was very bad, that she wasn't expected to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I told her to save her.
I said, "Tashi, I'm happy for you, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping were soon disappearing and departing from her system.
She died some time before and now everything was closing down.
I just had to sit there, knowing that this was falling out.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to keep to myself."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, being tormented by the death of her daughter, went on the plane alongside the other passengers - not knowing the heartache she had.
"We didn't know," she said.
"I had my head shaved and my head shaved all the time.
It's hard to explain but when I was on the flight I felt profound pity for Nad.
It was my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's clothing is designed to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost people close to them due to suicide are trying to keep others from putting their own hand to death.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a bridge in Wales with exciting messages on them as well as numbers that people can call on for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and put a hand in his own death when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef and that his sense of humour was being slandered by others.
Everyone knew him because of his sense of humor.
"They're always trying to get out of a room."
However, he resigned his post before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, became his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that that will affect him."
Ms Davis created the cards, "for people to know that there are people that they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't hold back if you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old spouse, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say it was bad or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that there had been a change of mindset.
It was the first day of Christmas - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look at them or anything."
She said that the trauma was great for him to die, but that they have to face him: "He separates the children.
It makes us stand out from each other.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in danger and the FBI has begun an investigation
"I thought, if we were really able to get something like what he wanted - a limited investigation in terms of time, scope - that we might have unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, also saying that he feared the committee was "falling apart" with a firm, convoluted sanity.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They are due to time constraints.
There are only 5 weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans succeed badly, as expected, they will be much weaker in their quest to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and then got to know his wife Ashley, while she was his personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI's report has been made?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and declare him to the Supreme Court.
There is a decrease in the number of people who are affected by the coronavirus.
The number of people who backed North Korea to leave for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the unified South Korean ministry, said 1,127 people brought back to North Korea last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China were key factors in charging higher rates by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not speak in public.
South Korean citizenship is eventually produced for most people who give back to North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which is the farthest border near North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Non-Army Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers those who back North Korea are illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their own country through pressure.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still undergoing a war technically - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang held a meeting for talks focusing on the negotiations about nuclear disarmament that were not progressing.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a general way of working towards the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear weapons-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho laid the blame on U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress from that.
"If the US is not trusted, there will be no confidence in our national security and in those circumstances, there is no way we will disarm ourselves on our own first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "terrible", and is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the nominee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was "terrorist" and was unfit in mind for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the traffic in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I have to think that if a woman did that, they would say 'contemporary'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has said he was sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very agitated, almost shouting and the speech sometimes departing from him as he talked about his children and his time in high school.
He clearly criticized the Democrats on the committee, giving the allegations against him an "abhorrent and coordinated humiliation" organized by liberals who were angry that Hilary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved, that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with the way he went in search of the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, she did not agree with that.
"I will say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only fitting to be in the Supreme Court but to be in the court where he is at present," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said she was concerned as a Democrat about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"It’s not the right time for a tame, biased person to go to court and expect us to say ‘that’s not great,’" Pelosi said.
Women need to fix it.
It's a corrective act, the months and years of anger being released, and it can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's a strange thing, do you think?"
She continued, "A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot, saying she was also crying when she got angry, but who developed a mean technique when she got angry and started crying, that she would say to the person with whom she was talking, "Maybe you'll find that I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was wonderful."
Tears are allowed as a way to release anger as they are basically not understood.
One of my most acute memories from an early job, in an office where men had a command, where I once found that I was weeping with anger that I couldn't express, was that an older woman grabbed a hold of the back of my neck - a ruthless manager who always feared me - and that pulled me into a staircase log.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"You don't know you're mad.
They will feel sorry for you, and they will be happy because they have sent you in."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democrat from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart while running for the presidency.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart was engaged in off-duty relationships on a boat called Monkey Business and when he left the race, Ms. Schroeder, with much frustration, decided that she should think about running for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a wise decision," she told me as she laughed 30 years later.
Seven other candidates were already in the race and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was last in the campaign, she was in the back in terms of fundraising so she promised she would only go in the race if she had raised $2 million.
It was a free work.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she asked herself.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system because it was so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger with sexuality - that she became a mattress.
"I think I was nervous," Ms. Schroeder recalled in response to the media.
"I think Kleenex was a corporate sponsor for me.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravestone?
"She did it?"
Why the trade war between Sam and China could be good for Beijing
You would be driven by the open possibilities of the U.S.-China trade war, and while the war is not over at all, Beijing may benefit in the long term from a dispute between the countries, according to the experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, gave the first warning earlier this year when he taxed China's central exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant tightening occurred this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), which meant that almost half of all goods coming into the US from China have been taxed.
Beijing achieves revenge in the same way every time, and the last act was to impose tariffs of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to U.S. blows, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to be disrupted any longer.
If Washington were observed to stand back it would mean that it would be necessary to obey their demands, but Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, would be too embarrassed if he publicly surrendered to the US.
Still, the experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term by lowering the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would actually trigger a failure of the economy in either country is far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on the Facility in the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country after it was destroyed by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today matters on the ground are much more stable and integrity thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government is still restoring the areas destroyed by terrorists to get things back to the way they normally are.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave are now in place due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that focused on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he made it clear that he would not accept aid or conditions aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
The Ryder Cup is held in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
Now he has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to get the best in the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, threw his hit into the water at the 16th hole par 3, and surrendered the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer made the deal in each round, and was one of four players who went 5-0-0 ever since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated at 5&4 by the player in the lowest position on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The highest-placed player in the world, Dustin Johnson 2 and 1 fell to Ian Poulter from England who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a former champion of the eight Ryder Cups, was the most European to ever win in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry but I don't have the strength for it today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting him.
I'm so happy to get the ball back.
The team is the most important thing and I'm glad I was able to help them," said Garcia excitedly after Europe's victory.
John Ram from the same country, who won 2&1 on the famous U.S. golfer Tiger Woods in singles matches on Sunday, will now replace him.
"I'm very proud to have won against Tiger Woods, I was looking at that man as I grew up," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a bizarre statistic for one of the best players ever, having won 14 major championships, and just Jack Nicklaus before.
It was difficult for the U.S. team to find the whites during the entire weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf during all the competition.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after playing his teams was a disappointing author, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
In the morning we thought we were going to Europe.
We fought.
I'm going to recommend Thomas.
That's a good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reorganise ourselves, work with American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I'm so proud of my 12 year old son and I'm proud of him.
You have to have congratulations.
The other team played better than us."
